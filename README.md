# Seq2seqChatbots
 
##### Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ricsinaruto/Seq2seqChatbots/wiki/Chatbot-and-Related-Research-Paper-Notes-with-Images) for this repository, it contains my notes on a multitude of chatbot research papers.
##### In the wiki_images I keep all the images used in the wiki for this repository.
##### In the doc folder the latex files and pictures are found for the paper related to this repo.

### seq2seq_tf_tutorial
Here I tried out the seq2seq tensorflow [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq). I couldn't include the trained model or the data into the repo because the size of the files is too large.
### transformer_chatbot
Check the [paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk_chatbot.pdf) for this project! In this folder I try to adapt the [Transformer](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor) model to the chatbot domain. I couldn't include the trained model because it's too big, but all the data and code can be found here.
