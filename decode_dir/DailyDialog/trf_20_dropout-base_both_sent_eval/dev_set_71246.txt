do you really think it s a bit bright ?
do you know which one he would like ?
i will .

that 's true . but sometimes it 's hard to wash clothes at the beginning of summer .
yes i 'd like to .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
to be honest with you but i 'm a little confused about the time .
the same as the one .
i 'm still thinking about that .
i am going to the hospital .
that 's harsh .
so you do n't have to promise me that you wo n't be absent .

it 's nice . but how much is it ?
it depends on how you want to send it for a new one or an online auction . if you want a soft sleeper it will cost <unk> rib .

i do n't know .
that 's what i am looking for .
they are n't even nervous about me .
oh it 's <unk> . she s always very good at making money .
that 's ok . but can you just go in the bathroom ?
that s great . i might have a try .
i 'm sorry but i could n't help it .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
ok . i ll pick you up at 600 .
i have to but i haven t played the game yet .
how many years have you held your current position ?
what are your parents like ?
no problem i have n't decided yet .
i 've already made a lot of money . i want to see if you can find a way of money i can see what you have done .
you said it .
where did you get it from ?
you do n't want to leave any more of your choice .
you can use a credit card at the end of the year .
let 's look at our menus .
could you do that ?
you did ? you must have been sitting there for hours .
of course . i will deposit my bag right now .
good idea . i 'll put the shopping basket back .

how do you use the lotion ?
its <unk> will be a big surprise to you .

how about a china vase ?
i 've got a few pounds of potatoes . i 'll take some small steaks and a bottle of hot dogs .
yeah . i 'll take this one . do you have a small portion ? i mean would you mind if i can do that ?
i don t like that .
well that sounds a good idea . but where are we going to have to find a solution ?
no probation is up .
ok . and would you like to have a drink ?
you 're a little short .
what 's the brand ?
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
well we 'd better go to the store to have some food .
i was just watching some television .
it 's hard work while exercising but it is a great feeling when i get done .
certainly . the <unk> leaves in twenty minutes .
yes i do n't think that we can do well . what do you think we should do ?
it 's hard to say . the most important thing is to be happy here .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . will you come with me ?
i m glad to hear that . as i ve just said i hope to conclude some substantial business with you .
no . those are the only thing they want to be independent . they do n't have enough time to work overtime .
i understand . you have been working very hard .
alright . well we have a full refund of 100 down here . but we can go to the car park .
i have a terrible headache .
well do you want me to tell you the truth ? i do n't think it 's too late .
well i want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation .
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
i am sorry . it must be the gas .

i like it . you re going to be a great night .
that s what i thought . i thought the same was my first time .
it s been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
i go to the gym a lot .
do you drive a car ?
it 's very kind of you to say . i feel a little stupid .
but i never thought about that !
i 'm sorry . he 's out of the town . do n't worry . he has a job as well .
i guess i 'm not good at machine development .
but you must be tired after working out on the day .
actually i have to take some exercise every day .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you can exercise more .
about three times a week if i can .
i 'd like to see some coats .
can you get a refund ?
no thanks . i 'm full .
i want you to take a look at the books .
that 's a good idea . this month we ll have a new slogan for a very exciting interview .
i have a great feeling .
should we hire someone for the car ?
you can also have a little free time here .
so this is going to be a huge headache .
you know i 'm not going to tell you .
i 'm waiting . . .
oh i see . do you want to join the <unk> ?

let me see . oh you seem to be in a hurry .
yes . shall i help you ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i appreciate you saying that .
no thanks . i need to help .
ok .
hi .
did you find anything ?
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok thank you .
i really want to go look at the kitchen . i think we should look at it .
i was told that the owners won t take a long time .
i 'm afraid you ca n't . we accept credit cards and cash .
you have a choice for today .
there is a desk and two chairs .
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
no . that will be all .
ok we will choose it .
it s two hundred and eighty dollars .
could i pay by check ?
ok . we offer 2 types of saving systems time savings and a discount .
i appreciate you saying that .
no thanks . i need to help .
well that 's just a few minutes walk to my office come around and see me now .
how long will it take if i walk ?
i think a cab is better .
who 's the ride ?
sorry but she s out .
sure . it 's just right .
i 'd like to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?
sure . come over here . as you can see that we have a special price range of different kinds .

i prefer the blue one .
what style do you want ?
it 's fine . but do n't you have anything cheaper ?

well they 're not cheap but it 's also very fashionable .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .

all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
not bad . actually it makes me look younger .
i 'll give you one .
yes i think so . how about the one on the left ?
my hat is the green dress . i don t think so . they re very fashionable .
maybe you should look around for an outlet .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
got it . to whom should i report ?
yes . and you 're a professor in need of a movie .
what about a gila monster ?
how am i going to have to get my license ?
i understand . but why wo n't you show me the logo ?
yeah we have to . but you really should have some shirts first . you could get in and relax .
ok thank you . all right . i am just waiting for your answer .
excuse me ?
sure . and without any conversion process or loss of quality .
i 'd like to see some coats .
yes where can you get your shoes ?
they 're ok but they 're not really fashionable .
i see . well in that case please let me know .

well if you ask him i can tell you the truth .
come on .
ok . i 'll take the pink one . and i 'm not sure about the special kind of taste .

what other kind of food do you like ?
we usually eat chicken pork and beef . you eat these meat a lot in your country too do n't you ?
yes i will .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year . i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
i will .
i knew that already .
get the jam and get some milk . i 'll go and get some that .
get the jam and butter while you are talking to . i 'll go and get the jam and a 'll go with you .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
what else are you going to do ?
do i have to pay an additional fee for that ?
yes . we re on a special day .
i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that such as sales manager or regional manager .
read the same carefully with your company .
then you re right . i ll check it for you .
i 'm clear so far .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
let me have a look .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
you 're right .

do you want to order anything else ?
yes . i 'll have that shrimp cocktail .

i ll take a little milk but no sugar please .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that sounds good . did you get the same logo as the first one ?

what are the color miss ?
they all have been together for a long time . usually i have to say they will have both harder and harder for them .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .

that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you ca n't spare one more .
no . i used to that .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .

you must have been prepared for the last half an hour .
what did you say ?
yeah i know that . i do n't have any questions about them .

i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah i know what you mean . that 's the case of the old people you 've got to know .
i was denied a visa ?
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . why ? it looks like something she would have to go with it .
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well maybe i can help you with that .
well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . today 's sale is still on .
yeah . it 's very simple . all you have to do is to write down your name and address at the bottom .
ok . here 's the money .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .

i suggest you treat him with patience affection and respect . if he needs to do something like that . please guide or be more careful about getting along with the cup of tea .
mom i 'd better not tempt him . please remember him .

it was a pleasure . i enjoyed helping you .
i do n't know . it 's a secret .
come on don t be angry ! i never knew anything .
so i have another question .
if you do n't mind you can just tell her with your wife .
sure . here you go .
good idea . we can also find a table sometime .
it 's absolutely amazing . but i do n't think the chinese tea set is the same for me .
it 's because of the bad weather .
i 'm sorry . you ca n't go to the right place . it 's not allowed to sit in and out .
that 's right .
well you can use them for more than a day .
i think it 's broken .
sure . take your time .
i 'll tell you what . good luck .
that 's what you like !
it 's quite a bit . do you have any other ideas ?
what 's the fare ?
it 's becoming more and the price is still high .
it 's so small . what about this one ? it 's called the china friendship shopping center .
i do n't know . i like the jeans but i need someone else to pay me back .
i thought i 'd go to the doctor 's to have a talk with him .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i see . the faint of heart should have some heart .
what ? i feel tired ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
how can i manage my exam ?
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well i 'll change the money thanks .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you look like a nice guy .
how about oil or spray ?
yes please . is there a problem ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
well when do you want to leave the car ?
could you please arrange it for me and i 'll talk to you about it tomorrow ?
your flight takes off at 8
will you stay for another day ?
i am sorry . we will arrange someone to come back .
yes that 's all .
could you tell me what night you will be home ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .

how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe . unripe are hard . unripe . unripe are hard . sets it 's hard to cut out .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
well it 's a fruit .
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .

i 've heard that the company has been keeping it for many years .
maybe . but if you want to buy some more wei they 're expensive to go to hong kong .
you 're right . all the things we need is to do is to check out .
i need to make sure that my prices are high .
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
good idea . i 'll think about it and get back to you as soon as possible .

oh yes .
yeah . . .

this way please . i 'll take this one .
which one would you recommend ?
that 's nice . it 's nice to have some green furniture .

can you give me a special offer ?
sure . any specific reason i should know about the design of the new product . they are set up the price .
does that actually work for you ?
it is 12 dollars various yuan of your skin and the color of your skin .
does it have a lot of nerve wracking job you know ?
you have to pay ten cents for the monthly sticker .

well i love hot food too .

i think japanese will be fine .
many times in america it is very far from here .
you will be an excellent choice .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes block . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the subway ? that 's too bad . i feel so hungry .
you can also put me in the amount of marketing department .
ok .
i have to drive . the parking lot is very crowded .
i do n't know .
be careful . it s dangerous to drive fast .
that 's terrible !
oh how interesting ! there was one thing after all .
that s great . i can do it by myself .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to a concert tonight .
i 'm sorry but i wo n't make it .
nobody told you what happened ?
ok . i 'll pick you up around 6
oh i see . you re right . i wish it were too much .
oh i see .
are you nuts ? did n't you get enough ?
i think something must be done .
do you mind if we re leaving here ?
but why were you getting off work so late ?
well i have to be going to move . do you want to go to another place ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
ok . i will arrange an interview for you .
do you have a copy of the library card ?
congratulations ! that 's really exciting !
i think you re trying to reduce our price by ten percent .
do you know if she has any questions about the new laptop ?
yes it sounds good .
yes sir . where to ?
please take me to this address .
the square is falling apart and the hotel is falling apart !
i have to be there before <unk> .
ok . i 'll be there around two .
that 's fine . is there a subway station in my hotel ?
is there anything you can do for me ?
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
only 308 per night .
oh i see .
thank you . anything else ?
yes and i ca n't find it .
hello madam . where to ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
i can check in our storage room .
you wo n't catch me because i love you . i 'm not a cheater .
do n't worry . it 's a <unk> .
here 's ten dollars .
it 's a private garden .
you are going to take a bus or a taxi .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
okay i am happy to hear that .
i hope so . thank you very much .
hi angela it 's dan .
have you got a black sheep ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
i am free tomorrow .
can i have my 200 please ?
no way !
ok . what about you ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 'll be on my way out . but you two are n't at one .
ok . thank you .
i know it 's old but i can t find it .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
oh ! i just drop in on him for a chat .
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the center of the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
hi linda this is my first day here . i have two concert complimentary tickets .
my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
fine . are you coming to visit us ?
i 've been good . i 'm in school right now .
what do you mean by something different ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
do n't be silly . i am not ready for this interview .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
it has been two or three days .
i will be there .
she 's pretty bad . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what if she was n't as good as you imagine .
yeah much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ?
hmm . . . well let me tell you that i 've seen him since i was a little boy . .
but he has an idea of how long he will take on to work .
i m sorry but i can t . because i have to do some housework . you can ask jenny to go with you
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
let s go to a car dealership . i 'll give you a try .
when i put it in add some air .
all right . i m gonna get a snack . .
what 's the solution ?
great ! can i get you a couple of tickets ?
hey ! every new year i went to a <unk> with this cafe . . .
what kind of cool computer do you want to play ?
are you serious ? you have to take the train i m not going to be late .
i m looking for a sweater .
oh you do ? what about our very well ?
i don t have a try . i ll just have a few minutes to get the stupid picture .
you bought a compact car ? that s a little expensive .
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i am not sure if i can get there with you .
thank you for your help . do you have a credit card with us ?
oh i see . and how many pieces of choose ?
it s a nice day ! the coffee shop is new and i m so fresh .
i don t thought that s why . advertising <unk> are so popular .
oh wait a minute ! where are you from ?
i don t want to have it . why do n't you try it ?
what 's wrong with my car ? this is the parking lot .
i 've just read it now . thank you for your help .
what s the average grade ?
see !
i am sorry . i do n't have any trouble with you .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
that 's going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
ok .
yes . there is one more thing .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
that s a good idea . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find out some more information for l c . i would like an outline of responsibilities both ours yours and the beneficiary please .
do you like roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have a great time !
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had a very busy day . it was a really nice place to work with a ll be fine .
and i also checked that we were trying to use the bathroom .
oh good come on . you look so busy today . did you see the new position you ve been in ?
she likes to have the same thing in the kitchen . it s so plain .
ok come on in please .
i don t know but i think the best way to figure out what the job might be it or not .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
that s great . i guess it s too cold for some rain .
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while . i prefer light blue to while .
what size are you ? we have a different color .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . there 's no hot water after 10 . stay away . and anyhow you will have to wait for a long time .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that you have a dog or a bathroom .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
how much is the rent for ?
can i have your name ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to get to eat ?
that s fine .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
you just did my best .
well i am not in the mood for this . if you can t meet me at the moment i ll always look at the best chance .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i like it . it makes me feel like i can do it . i have a good cook and a lot of things .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i did ! i found some great things i needed yesterday .
yeah it 's really good . i have never tried this one but i just want to try and now .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
oh do you have anything particular in your account ?
maybe a little . but i want to have a try .
certainly . may i take a look at the layout ? it 's a bit too plain .
maybe you have a point .
i don t think this apartment would be too expensive . take a look at this one .
ok . i ll take this one . anything else ?
i can ring you up at the register for you . do you want to have a subscription ?
a red one will do .
all right . anything else ?
i want to wear a formal dress .
i m sorry . i know you ve got a nasty memory .
the list goes on and on .
i am the manager . can i help you ?
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about your interest ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's a great place to watch a similar house .
oh how much is the room ?
good . i will see you then .
i 'll be at your house at about five thirty .
i already know what to get .
why ca n't you go to the airport and have a look at the same stage ?
should i bring anything with me ?
there 's a change of papers .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am sure the price will be negotiable .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
that s great . i m so sorry .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it .
okay what do you think ?
what about yourself ? can you see that ?
if i could help you in the kitchen i could pick it up .
is you right ? the view is heavy .
oh look they have some refreshments in here .
would you please put a luggage on the scale ?
i will take it .
we have two brothers and one dog .
that is exactly what i wanted !
what s the kitchen like ?
i really like it .
oh i see . let me see .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
i love the beautiful lawn . and i love the bird very much .
i thought we should fix the wood . let 's go check it out .
thank you . there are a lot of samples to our customers .
that s what i mean .
this is kevin .
hello this is bob . i was wondering if you would like to come over to a dinner with me ?
it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i do n't think so . it s a bit too expensive though .
i love you too dad .
yes . i 've got to go .
that 's great . this is your key . if you need anything at all please dial 0 .
okay .
so you have to type all day .
thank you . i 'll do that for you .
no but if you can keep the record i ll need for you .
yes i m looking for a winter jacket .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i am afraid i have n't got any . but i know you have a job that is more impressive .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
well thanks for the encouragement .
well that depends .
can i have my 200 please ?
you bet . i can find it . that 's my first time to learn something new .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't do that .
what ? are you serious ?
i do n't believe this is going to be a good thing .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the time .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you have a big fever ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
all right . i 've got an idea . why do n't you ask me to do the same for me ?
i 've been thinking about this for a while . can i have a look at the microwave oven ?
what style do you want ?
not too long . actually i am really tired of this oldfashioned style that i have got to take a look at .
ok now we have a full eye of eye shadow . do you want to have a nice piece of salt or a nice piece of cake ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you more .
you 're welcome . i 'll see you on the new market .
no not at all . the examples are not as important as the old ones .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
really ? i ll be glad to have them done . i ll be sure if i knew anything would be the best choice .
right . the short one has made us tired and the right .
really ? it s unfair .
it 's a serious problem . i make expecting an important call .
ok . but only if you think it 's a bit too cold .
yes but we charge 50 cents for it .
sure . do you want to take a look at this one ? it is worth every penny of the latest design .
oh that 's right . i thought you were coming today .
i 'll be expecting you then .
but this place is full of place for rent . i 'm going to take a look at apartments with you .
hey listen . it 's outside . listen i really do n't know how you can go .
i know what you mean .
why ? it does n't make sense .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
let 's give him a hand .
of course it is ! we do n't have the same problem with that . and our brand should be very fresh .
well you 're right . i 'll just give them a discount .
why ? the new apartment is so small on the market !
how long did you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
what other things do you want to check ?
would it be a very expensive house ?
yes we can also meet the new apartment on the market .
then what about your opinion ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
ok let 's go .
no not at all . it 's just that i like an old one . you wo n't be disappointed .
actually it 's a bit too far away .
sure . let 's do it .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about drinks ?
i prefer chinese food .
i am really hot . i think i 'll go to chinatown .
oh yes . i remember it very clearly . is n't it ?
oh .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i have n't . i 'm learning chinese .
do you think you 'll like them ?
you 're right .
i mainly got chow mein from that restaurant near here . can you start with that ?
i am thinking of making some chinese food .
have you been learning japanese ?
yes madam . i can teach you how to use your old apartment .
well i was thinking of getting some chinese food .
i like this jacket . can i try it on ?
ok . i ll do that .
no . you should go to the library and have some questions .
alright . and i can see that now . is there a chinese restaurant ?
how many pieces of baggage do you want ?
no not really .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i want to buy some of the same style .
it s the same in the past few months and we have lots of exercise experience .
may i make a special one ?
they are morning <unk> . they are the roses with the advantage of human resources .
i 've got to buy some things at home .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
you are right . but what kind of product do you have in mind ?
that 's right . there are many good restaurants in our city .
come on it 's nothing . it 's a big deal .
you missed a court appearance .
the company of selling electronics stores are comfortable and those of their study very well . i am told that the market were arranged and the people looking for a leather system . the market is n't it ?
i was born and raised in california . and you know how to use the stairs .
i am very happy to hear that . would you like anything else ?
the pass is free .
i know . i want to get some books for my girlfriend . they have a good chance to do something .
ok .
yes . i m excited to help .
do you want to check out now ?
i lost it .
yes i bought a new car for you . it 's a real bargain .
i want to return this cellphone .
go and try it on .
oh i see . well it looks like you have a good price . we will continue our trip in the city .
would you like to get me a little cheaper ?
10 in that case i 'll take two bottles of wine and a discount .
but the problem is that i have a discount for a new one .
it 's absolutely not my fault .
i 'd be quite willing to help . i 'll adjust the position i 'm afraid we have to adjust the fast pitch to the new position of our products .
the meeting is at six o 'clock so i have to wait for the next few minutes .
i 'm afraid we ca n't help you sir because that would be violating the regulations . i owe you a glass of coffee .
how long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
that 's a good idea . i 'll try it .
i really appreciate that .
sure go ahead .
can you keep an eye on my bag please ? nature 's calling .
that 's great . i am also thinking of something is wrong with the food .
would you send an ambulance ?
yep . and it is good to eat chinese food .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
they simply ca n't bear to put them away . so they need n't just let them go .
i also think that chinese food is a little spicy but they need some tasty and tasty .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
wow ! that would be very kind of you !
oh come on . a few minutes later it 's really a real treat .
well i think you are the only one for me .
i see . do you live alone ?
yes i did . i send them to several of them next week . so i think it 's a fantastic place to get people .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
yeah ! i know you re a great student ! what 's that ?
about three times a week if i can cook it .
yeah but you are right ! i usually end up feeling like my mom .
yeah you are right . i could n't eat a bite at all .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
we usually get a lot of things .
ok so how about some lamb kebabs and roast chicken chops and some fried chicken wings ?
yes we do . i find something similar to chinese food .
so what do you think of the leading actors ?
i never eat breakfast at my restaurant .
yeah i like cooking too . do you like chinese food ?
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
it 's important to do proper exercises .
well that 's not fair you know .
it will be the best one i have ever seen . you are such a beautiful bride .
no . that 's not enough . i 've already been too busy to work .
sure . we will be ready in a minute .
i think i could use some beers .
not for me but it does n't make any sense .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that coke is very good for us .
haha . i could never do that . now you do n't want to lose a lot of weight . after all you 've got to do is work with the preparation .
here you are . ms . stevens is ready for you now .
they are too bright . i guess we should ask them to give them some advice .
sounds good . i 'll have that too .
thank you for your love and care over the years .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
i know . i do n't know .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i mainly eat baked chicken because there 's not a lot of fat .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?

thank you . i 'll have a sandwich for you .
no i 'd like a apple pie .
what kind of apples do you like ?
well i think i will have a dish of vanilla ice cream .
i do n't have the slightest clue .
it 's true .
yeah you are right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake of milk that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yeah but you are right ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have a try .
i have never tasted that .

i can t tell you what the problem is .
the system crashed when i was surfing on the internet .

thanks for the understanding .
that s going to be a very long way to fix it .
yes but i do n't think so .
do you have any other questions ?
a pipe in my apartment is leaking .
that s all right . the faucet in the bathtub and that under the water can be dangerous .
i heard that you moved to florida .
you too .
first of all i need you to do the drying up . i m almost finished the washing up . i m going to clean the cooker when i finish .
that s true .
thanks . see you .
i can t be serious .
that s all right .
what are we going to do to fix it ?
i have not gotten my problem .
did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
i think the issue of greatest concern is that all the office equipments like that .
maybe i should think about going to the movies !
my house is going to live in the apartment and i know the city of there are two people that are on the open house .
that 's cool and convenient . i 'll have a savings account with you then . what kind of apartment do you have ?
i will be coming over to look at it this afternoon .
i ll just sign here please .
no i do n't . i 'm waiting for this bus .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i want to watch a movie and having a movie with you .
it must be locked .
no . but we have a total of time .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
that 's true .
ok . i know .
there on the window .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my wife was a little ill so i was trying to leave this office for the first thing .
but we could take the subway .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i 'll see you on saturday . bye .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
i 'll wait for you at the airport .
no i don t . i think it 's much safer than bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i have n't .
what s on ?
i ca n't afford it .
i do n't want to get a promotion .
you get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
what do you think we should hire a car and enjoy the scenery ?
well i think i 'll walk .
how long are you going to stay there ?
it 's not the same as the bus .
i do n't know .
yes i got it .
i think you 're right . i 'll be glad to see you again .
no i always feel terrible .
i am glad you like it .
i messed up .
hi mary where do you work ?
i am just pulling my leg paul . i have a headache .
really ? how could you do that ?
i 'm not sure yet .
of course i am happy to hear that and i took care of you .
no i m not . i accept that .
you like the food there ?
for sure .
well sometimes the starting salary is very high .
i insist . i really appreciate the offer but i must pay much attention to the safety box of course .
can you do it this afternoon ?
i was so excited . i forgot to bring this letter .
i 'm so surprised .
why do n't you ask me if the class is going to be so late ?
because we are too many things to do .
it 's almost impossible to get the right balance .
it 's only a couple of times . and you can do some exercise .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but she speaks very clearly and does n't use very complicated words so i have to learn french .
i told you not to forget to bring the letter .
well it s no problem .
ok we are ready to take a look at the shop .
my favorite job is serving clients and giving them what they want .
we have to stay in touch .
that 's not bad . how about the price ?
have a nice day .
i 've been working a lot lately .
yes we have .
i was denied a visa ?
well i have no regrets !
i want to get hold of the plane for their vacation .
i agree with you . i have done a lot of work in this way .
i think i want to try a new style .
do n't worry . i 'll tell him .
i have n't been willing to study hard .
i know what you mean . i thought you were meant . i thought maybe you were able to understand what you were n't .
yes . i like traveling and other .
can i have my 200 please ?
i 'm going to register right now .
i like the novels of dickens very much i have learned a lot .
what other kind of english is that ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could n't .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
oh . . .
what kind of soup do you need ?

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
certainly . it 's quite different from the chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern way to a chinese dinner .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i remember he has to be very helpful .
well there is one around the corner .
let me see . . . oh yes !
yes . it 's not far .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
i am sorry to hear that . but please give me a call if you need any help .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
how long is it valid ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i ve already got a job working in an office . i d like to help companies with all the clients on my own .
i agree with you . i think you re right .
do you have a clear idea about the job ?
i see . and how about the salesman ?
i think that i can work hard . i know that a building that is a perfect fit for me .
perhaps . i m not too worried about it .
i can t believe that . how much is i can t pay ?
that 's good . do we have to pay extra for that ?
i think you re right . there s nothing wrong with the design . i think that s better than keeping us a better friend .
how did you know that ?
i have been feeling pretty good dr . smith .
your wife will be thrilled with the roses .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
do you want to get a promotion ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
did you happen to watch the football game last night ?
do you have any questions ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
here s the thing that i ve ever heard about . remember the parties from the whites and put them in a bag of water and this sweater .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
get some eggs milk and bread .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
wow ! why do n't you go to see the empire state building ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i 'd like to see some coats .
they re not here .
i have my driver 's license .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?

i 'm afraid not . i 'll be too busy .
yes i need to do that .
can you tell me about the responsibilities of your interview ?
i 'm afraid you 've got to leave .
i could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four what time works out best ?
i 'd like to have a headache and my stomach hurts .
how about this . when you have time ?

i 'll be back as soon as possible sir . i 've got a meeting tomorrow night .
i 'm not sure but i do n't know what to do .
oh ! it 's perfect . i think i 'll take it . would you wrap it please ?
sure honey .
good . how about this beach ? i have n't seen you for several days .
of course . this is very good brand . and our products are specially designed to moisturize the skin .
do you like this one ? it 's a 16 pan .
that 's too bad .
i do n't think he 's serious .
what kind of qualities do you have in mind ?
it 's not a bad idea . you can also take a certain course in english .
ok . now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .

is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
where shall we go now ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes . this is a very famous brand .
can i have my 200 please ?
well i think something is wrong with my heavy work .
what about guessing games ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
no . i used to that .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if we accept the fun or the training course we can play tennis . how about going on a hiking trip in the mountains ?
good . let 's go now .
i appreciate your help .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like sitting in the desk all day .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
so i will have the new music tonight .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh no !
i just stayed at home and watched tv .
do you think that she 'll be sad ?
sure . what can i do for you ?
i 'm looking for a leather belt for my husband .
i apologize . we 'll cancel it right now .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
did you lose a good job ?
no that 's all .
i 'll take this steak dinner . do you like it rare medium or welldone ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing .
well we have a lot of new boxes here . can you go to the store to buy some ?
i 'll use <unk> soup and charge it to the kitchen .
we welcome new business .
i prefer cooked fish to raw fish .
that 's the address .
yes sir . what comes with the special ?
that 's the most important thing .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
would you like to buy one here ?
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
no . i need to go to the bank .
sorry . no . you can take the subway to .
yes it 's too big for me .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi . could you give me some advice on that new account ?
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have already shipped it to you last month .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you are right .
i guess this is going to be a great thing .
thank you for your concern .
oh do you know if i need to go to the store to get some other solutions ?
when do you find it ?
yeah i do n't know . maybe i can find the way to my daughter 's home .
did you forget to buy a new house ?
i know what you mean . . well i ll just put up with the new project and ask them to give them a hand .
do you mean you can have a smaller price ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
my friend and i are playing a piano .
that s great . we ve got to get started . i m really proud of you !
i ll have to try but if you want to have it done tomorrow .
i love you .
hey honey i know you 've been playing the piano for years .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
could i have a transfer please ?
oh great ! thank you so much .
will we be there soon ?
do you have a car ?
oh amy . i 'm too sorry .
what about the new bar ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! i know you are really lucky !
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
ok . look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m not too good to hear this .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
great idea !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
well you have to get a seat over there .
i am so glad i finally got your letter .
what are you talking about ? you probably got a little snack .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m your little guys . you know my friends would never be so shy !
did you really have any questions ?
you mean like a breast enlargement ? i do n't think that 's really necessary . that 's not the way a woman should stay attractive .
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's not for the fact that it 's your father 's day .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
i know . it 's not all my fault anna .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes but i find these sorts of things hard to say . i even ca n't seem to be able to read them .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and and and and and and and and people . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yes i <unk> my own . i just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . we all need our private space . but i also think interpersonal skills very important .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . i 've heard of it before .
i was n't too happy about it .
oh it 's easy . i love this job so much .
i think your knowledge of english is really good .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i appreciate what you have to do .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
sorry i know that i have to go .
i was denied a visa ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
what do you think of the subjects you are interested in ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i have a big date tonight .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
do n't be silly .
i 've got it down in the department .
it 's only the same in my life . i also know that you like him .
you 're so cute !
well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he has a far away from him .
i think you 'd better take him to dinner or something .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh no !
you take care of yourself .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
you can keep a low profile .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
yes it is .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
does it hurt ?
why not ? i do n't like to go there . i do n't want to go straight ahead .
oh i 'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
you re right .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i 'd like to .
i 'm ok so far .
i do n't care .
ok ! i 'll get back to you .
i am so glad that you took me to the mall .
i am happy to hear that and want to pay for the dinner ?
thanks for everything .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were going to get a new game .
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know .
i think that maybe it is right . but i still know that they will change a new job .
great . but bob is more peaceful than cooking .
i have n't seen you for ages .
just watching some television .
i am tired of doing that boring work .
show me your <unk> .
of course it is . everything is probably a little too big .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . .
i see .
i want to have a bath .
could you tell me a bit more about the work there ?
sure . this is a really good bargain .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
ok . i will go get it .
how do you keep fit ?
that 's great . let 's go !
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
should we walk ?
yes it is . there are many people in the living room .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you want to go to the beach this weekend ?
these books over here are a history . can you show them to the books ?
yes we had a very pleasant time .
i ca n't miss it .
i have a house in the suburbs .
well . i heard that she 's going to give me a back of dad .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
can you give him a message ?
no joke !
i think they are sense of post mentality quality first aid ability emergency adjustment and law consciousness .
but you still look very active and energetic .
oh they are the things that are on sale .
i do n't know . . .
i guess i do n't know what to say . it 's a natural one you have .
it s a good idea . you know it s a good game for a football match .
haha . please do n't tell me you 've got a dead stack . i 'm not required to know . .
no i have n't .
i 'm a real man !
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
it 's hard to get outside . you can start biking to work .
are you interested in doing different fundraisers ?
what 's good to see you set up ?
thanks i will !
what 's the special price of these shirts ?
you did n't have anything bad to worry about . do you want to study first ?
do n't take a picture of me .
i will .
in the second . i was in a hurry . we had a terrific time .
well done ! i love you so much . you know tired as you know how to <unk> yourself . i can t compare you to the game with some colleagues .
you guys are working around the clock i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves .
oh come on . that s not a bad idea . why don t you go to the square and take a look at the safety manual or other hard drive ?
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
oh that s interesting . let s go to that back to our final office first .
no i always feel terrible .
if you want to watch so much television then i 'll listen to your film .
of course . i will try my best to be a problem .
that 's the heart of lake there .
this is the first place we have been living in washington square .
wow ! that 's just the ball we need .
no i 'm just too professional . you know that i 'm doing a great job .
ok . i feel like sitting down in the office .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i speak english quite fluently but i was at the beginning of class .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he is a hard worker .
i know it 's so perfect ! my personal pledge is a huge <unk> .
sure . let me show you some of the first time .
did you see the unit was saying anything about it ?
yes we will be there on next week .
how many chapters does the book have ?
ha come on !
he 's pretty easy to get along with . it makes me feel that i have seen anything .
what about it ?
i know you do the right thing . i think we can handle it well .
he must be very happy with you .
maybe . i 'm glad to hear that .
huh ?
huh ?
we 're working together on christmas .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a reservation for you .
ok . . . actually we have some more daylight available . would you like to go with me ?
yes . she is very lovely and has been her hair for a while .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's your parents opinion ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
why do n't you ask her ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i do n't know .
but that movie is out of this question .
oh i did n't know that . she s one of the best ones in my family .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
sure ! it 's a real mix of books .
yes of course . it s very interesting .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
let me think . oh we can enjoy the plum blossoms blossoms very much . that 's it .
ok . you have to be very careful .
it says here that you are going to have a court b .
that 's true . i also heard that the chinese men in this city are often rebellious !
well it 's a bit . do you like the color ?
what 's the difference ?
i do n't think it 's that bad . the gas and the battery is also on the tip of my tongue .
i m crazy about it .
really ? i want to go too .
8 . they are four feet of the gross .
i like the way that the seat is fast .
i sure will .
it was a good thing to do .
i know . and you know what he will get for all the semester !
not really . the government is working on it .
me too . i appreciate that .
no there is not as many as you want .
no . but his wife has been living with him for a long time .
ok . i 'll put it on .
that 's the most important thing .
i guess so . he is really hard to avoid in a sense of humor .
you got it . i started not working so much at night . on the weekend i got to know more about those things .
yeah . it s a very good idea to keep a regular exercise .
you got it .
i have heard that some people say that you will be happy with them .
i do n't know . i mean i 'll have to say anything but i can do it .
what a lucky name !
she 's eightyseven .
all right . and i 've heard that some of the office are going to take a back home to work .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
i know but i was really trying to pull it down .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh . i 'm sure .
hi ! could you tell me where it is ?
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
my name is li . what 's yours ?
what do you do ?
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
what do you like about it ?
i am from new york .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't know . i took the time .
how long have you been married ?
i don t think so . i took it but i was very good at it .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not much just a house party like that .
do you think that he can do well ?
oh that 's really tough .
yes . he was supposed to be able to take the plane tickets to school .
i must tell you what happened .
it 's a good idea . he 'll have to get a face from work .
i know that but it 's not all my fault anna . you know he always has to be on my mind .
great . take care .
neither . the game ended in two all .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
of course not . he 's so talented ! he 's a brilliant movie !
oh right . what do you do ?
no do n't worry . i will try my best to get the perfect attendance report by the end of the month .
so you 're right . let 's see that you spent next year .
yeah . but his wife was in a hospital with me . i saw him again yesterday .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
oh how 's that ?

hello ! could you tell me what 's up ?
i 'm not sure if i could ask you some questions about a loan .
that 's great . i 'd love to .
thanks so much . i am sure i can figure it out .

i 'm glad you found it .
good luck .

i plan on going back to school .

but what if she was n't as good as you imagine .
yeah much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ?
hmm . . . well let me tell you that i 've seen him since i was a little boy . .
but he has an idea of how long he will take on to work .
i m sorry but i can t . because i have to do some housework . you can ask jenny to go with you

it surely is . you can go to the bar near the bus stop and have a good rest .
she 's far better than my old boss . he does n't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down .
i think that had a litter too much of the punch .
i just started with a boyfriend .
which john ?
can i have my 200 please ?
he told me that i has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
my god ! he 's so perfect .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
a car ? is n't that the car ?
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
really ! you live in taiwan !
they sure are .
i do n't know . i am a big fan of black people . and they will follow the same thing .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did they mention anything else ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i think so . it 's sort of you really like it .
he took the money and tried to get away .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he stood you up .
i 'm sorry we ca n't take the subway . i 'm not sure we have a good selection of earrings .
well i 'm not sure . i guess i 'll try it .
great ! i 'll sing happy birthday !
he 's all right . he also got a big fan of him .
both are cheaper .
that 's fine . i 'll be there around 230 pm .
that sounds really good .
i met him through a computer bulletin board .
what would you like to order ?
no . not at all . she 's a bit depressed . i have no idea what to do .
i had a few years of the college . i was not sure .
and her voice like a lark 's song ?
you have n't seen her yet .
i had a few friends . i think that 's the problem .
i think that did a good job . but i think that did n't have any problems .
he asked me to leave my present job .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
see you on thursday then .
well then thanks for everything .
and here 's a gift for you .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . let 's go .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm ok ?
ok .
see you !
that 's terrible .
that sounds ideal . what does your family think of her ?
it 's amazing . and it 's expensive to gather in for our chinese food now .
wow ! it 's interesting ! the festival is so huge !
no most of the students do n't have to pay for overtime .
do n't worry . i 'm sure everything will be perfect .
i do n't know . maybe you can find something or something like that .
it 's a good idea .
because i love the snow .
ok . let 's meet there .
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
oh i see . reading for example ?
one just down the street .
and you did n't have time to play football . you should have won a good time in the morning .
the party starts at 8 .
fine .
i just need a snack .
i am going to the library .
okay . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
it is best to say that i can have a few questions about the travelling costs .
ok . let me have a look .
oh thank you . she 's my wife . she must be very pleased .
oh it is really beautiful . i ve been thinking of all these ailments i got a splinter the other day . it took a long time for me to get it out of my skin .
i love it . it 's a nice room .
so our company will have to pay a dime for every year .
sure . it 's divided into two parts the junior year and the ancient custom .
could you tell me the reason why i 'm having dinner together ?
i do n't think that 's possible . i 'll have a good time to think about it .
and what about dinner ?
they re an opera star .
no way ! they are too dangerous . some are dangerous for kids like that . i like to go to school .
i see . why do n't you ask them to buy the new balance ?
my dad and dad are a lot of cooking . they learn something about it . besides my father made it too .
i do n't know . i have to discuss it with my boss .
oh that 's great . we can also take the dragon kite with us . after the picnic we can fly it .
what 's your plan now ?
can we get something to drink ? we want some more chicken .
what 's so bad about it ?
paris in the city .
i 've got it . but do n't you think it 's a little use ?
i m not sure yet .
wow ! what else does it do ?
yeah . and she is a very good student . i have to pay face the bills .
so it 's an <unk> ?
you can use the <unk> paper to either print out or your computer .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
well if they want to go to the party then they can go to a gym .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
it 's very nice of you .
you 'd better tell your sister what happened .
sure i 'll be there .
well i guess you are right .
it 's 150 .
what 's the rate ?
yes i do .
i do n't think that i ever heard of that house .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's a looking for ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's head for ourselves . i ca n't wait to see the louvre . i think we can talk about the bar in the minutes .
i hope you enjoy yourself .
thank you . i think i will be happy to get this business with you .
that s the reason it was such a great game .
hmm . . . well i think that fantastic meal is the most important part of the game .
by the way we also have some nice shoes .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
thanks . i .
i usually ride my bike .
never ?
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'll see you on the 25th .
no i think that is very nice .
it 's a nice dinner .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . the management is pretty busy these days . what about tomorrow ?
it 's a deal .
i think this glass is amazing !
oh yes . i suppose i am . what time does the holiday start ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
no i did n't . i was in the mood for something else .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
yeah . i got to eat as much pizza as possible .
did you take a job on your visa ?
it was that loud and it was pretty late .
it s nice to meet you too .
how about a training course ?
i think you need to update your cv . bring it over to my office tomorrow and i 'll talk with you later .
no . it 's all yours .
oh my god ! do you know how to do it ?
i 'm afraid so . we have n't met before .
it 's me a pleasure to meet you miss green .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's an exciting dance you know .
no i do n't think so . it 's much fun .
oh it 's a disco . let 's dance it .
hey ! what about you ? how about your history teacher ?
sounds interesting !
not all the same nowadays i must say . some of the chinese economic policies are the same economic expert last week .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . it 's quite <unk> .
that 's true . by the way do you have any certificates on the computer ?
let me see . . . the men with the right .
so kung fu is also a means of selfcultivation is n't it ?
a little bit . i 'm looking for the internet to see if anyone 's got a little bit of a .
sure you do . i love it .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
it 's nice . i am afraid we have n't had a big party for the party . there is a good restaurant and i will go .
how long is the music ?
oh i love song . when i was a child .
i know you do n't dance to try . but i know you do n't often dance .
yes it 's my favorite .
you 're a good dancer . you know i still need to know how to play tennis .
you 're a good dancer .
my pleasure . i have a dance class tomorrow evening .
yes . it 's very nice .
let me show you some of the way .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm in a hurry .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course . it 's an american company . but i have a lot of english .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
do you think the news is wellmatched ?
i ve been accepted !
sure . it 's dancing .
yes . you like to play basketball .
you 're lucky .
oh a . did you go to a disco ?
what gift do you want to play ?
you 're going to be dancing ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
well the dance floor is beautiful .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
table tennis .
then what do you think of the english learning ?
yes . there is a dining car towards the front of the train .
oh i see . then what a pity ! i do n't like horror movies like this . how many of them do you have ?
yes of course . this is the most popular song i have ever had .
what makes you think so ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
how long is the bus ride ?
that s a good idea
it 's not time consuming at all .
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
this is your latest model .
and we have been looking forward to this for a long time . have you got any idea of this ?
so we must seize this chance to go the beach .
it is really gorgeous out today . i remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i 've been watching that you like several times .
it 's pretty bad . but i think it 's going to be a little sunny .
how about winter ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
i like winter too but i love the sand . it can be seen in summer .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i m feeling a little sick .
is it very cold in winter ?
i like your cooking very much .
it 's so beautiful .
yes . i 'm from guangzhou . i 'm from guangzhou .
you look so young .
well you know i have been cooking for three years .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
you 've welcome . i 'm always willing to help good friends .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
i enjoyed helping you too .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
certainly what is it ?
may i turn on the tv then ?
i 'm busy on the 17th .
thank you . please do n't eat breakfast at the cafe .
that s fine . i am really sorry .
yes . i am . what 's going on ?
how 's the new bar across the road ?
i 'd love to .
go to the airport .
oh that 's good .
i was robbed this morning .
yes we have . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
good . bye .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do n't just drive a car . it 's not even noon . the heat is coming . and they do n't have to worry about it .
it wo n't start .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . that 's fine . would you mind if i move the car ?
it 's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ?
i know it 's a good car .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
let me ! it seems like there are a lot of things i have to get .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he do something wrong ?
you do n't think it is fresh .
is he getting better now ?
yes he 's getting up with his work .
you are welcome . have a great day .
yes we certainly enjoyed our meal .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that 's wonderful !
yes . he 's very handsome i think .
i am happy to hear that sir . would you like to have him now ?
i do n't know . i like helping people on the spot .
well . . . i guess i was paying for a dinner party this morning . and i could n't care less about a drink .
then i wo n't .
i 'd love to .
well . . . actually we have some more drinks left . would you like to have dinner at garden hotel next wednesday ?
well i 'm not free tomorrow evening . i 'll come to your house on my way out . what time ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . the restaurant is held on double occupancy . it s such a beautiful country .
what about a cell phone ?
that s the one .
who are the members of your family ?
yes i have a small family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
yes it seems to be quite good !
i 'm very sorry . what did you say ?
you re welcome . i hope you enjoyed your stay in boston ?
you are very welcome . bye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
do n't mention it . see you .
not bad . you know i 'm too afraid of making her own heart is full . and i think you could ask her if you do n't go on a date .
after all i find something she s really depressed .
i do n't think so . she s pretty but she always blows hot and cold .
that 's true . but i think women are better than her .
it s a small world isn t it ?
ok . i 'd like to try that .
ok . by the way i do n't think you can manage it on time .
but those people say that they 're not good enough to get up early .
you should attend a meeting in the same day . it is important that you need to read the class and the necessary exercise .
i know that . i mean i have to work hard in this company and i want to share some other things with you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i did . it s an interesting interview .
did you see the interview him was crash ?
yes where do you want to go ?
of course . but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and they will make you happy .
oh then let me take a look .
oh yes . you must have seen the watch .
i am not sure but i did n't like the design .
i do n't know .
quite interesting . they 've read a lot of good articles in our company .
yes . but thank you very much . should i give you a ring later ?
how much are they ?
i know . let 's go .
it 's ok . if i were you i 'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you leave the office . whatever you do n't think you can come back to the end of the year .
me too . do you want to go to bed ?
do you know how to set up the timer ?
that sounds like a good idea . what kind of food do you want to see ?
thanks i feel so good .
yes you are right .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop smoking . you know .
oh my god do n't you know that such an english restaurant is not healthy ?
oh yes . i heard that the chinese men were the best .
i do n't believe they are the same thing .
i suppose it was n't so special .
they were milestones in their times .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
basically i ve got a few concerns about him and the bottom line is i don t think i ve ever got a job that i like you and my sister said she need to go to the university .
that is ok mr . li . that is just as a bar called !
oh you do n't believe it .
sure what time is it ?
yeah i think you 'll find something similar to the internet .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also have an idea of how many people i am about meeting and i always have a good time to work with .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot . i 'll be there in about a minute .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to a concert tonight .
i think that sounds like a good idea . how long will it take to get there ?
i have been there in the states .
oh it 's very lovely of you . i think you 'd better take a walk to the western restaurant .
3 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about 20 years ago . it 's about 20 years ago .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
yes . what 's a great personal family ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think 2000 .
oh my son looks like a grownup .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
yes it is . can i speak it ?
they are 168 .
yes it is . i ca n't speak it well .
yes they re right .
hi david . what can i do for you ?
i can skillfully use dos windows .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
yes . she is very tall and slim .
it s very good .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
yes it s very close .
what do you want to know ?
thanks li .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
i wonder if they could n't drive it .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
sure . i 'd like to know what you mean . we have a few questions about this year .
do you know what ?
oh thank you .
sounds like fun .
yeah i guess i could add her some new friends .
yes . i am glad you are enjoying it .
how can you cheat on your wife ? you can t have a gun .
well i am not finding the boss but there are always a few problems .
no it 's the most important thing in the company .
ok . what time ?
no . i m afraid i m going to have to .
have you lived in an previous company ?
not much i 'm used to it .
well dear you did n't want to talk to me about it .
where are you going to work then ?
sure but it s still early .
great ! it 's been a long time .
of course not . but you will be single if you would have been in my last job .
yeah . i heard that he has 20 years of history .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but it 's my fault .
well . you must be going .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total is 45 yuan .
i know that .
do n't you know that sister has a baby so i do n't have any more than that ?
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i do . i think it s very interesting .
what kind of scholarship is it ?
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
it does n't matter .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
oh yes . do you like it ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 'm not . i 've put on a credit card and my credit card .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
because i love the snow .
i know what you mean . i could stand a hat but all the whole time .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i am surfing the net .
that sounds like a good idea . did you go swimming too ?
ok . i l pick you up at 6 o clock .
of course !
no i 'd like to be home later .
i 'll be there .
of course not . you mean the film will be too boring for me .
i have no idea if you can pass this call .
i 'd love to go out with my family . what 's up ?
i have n't thought of that . is it a chinese restaurant ?
it is better than paying someone is our office . you can have a simple introduction if you need staff to do so .
it is a <unk> exhibition of french sculptures at your university and your credit rating are both suitable for this position .
i was hoping to get a place for the first time .
you have made a good choice . it 's a mix of the latest fashion .
and this kind of italian face is so delicate and beautiful .
yes of course . i will be there !
i am glad you hear that .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to work late tonight and i have to go .

i 'd love to . but i 'm a bit short . can you make it for me ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like that .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?

and what do you do ted ?
fine . thanks .
i haven t seen you for several days .
no problem . we have got some .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i 'll go myself then .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would eat a cow while i m moving .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well the government got it fixed yesterday . we ve had a lot of nerve wracking people know .
don t worry about them . i ll always be happy to share the same with you .
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her so her supervisor called you .
really ? i do n't know .
tom that lucky guy .
he is well doing ok . but busy as usual .
yeah . he s been having an easy time since he was a boy and now he doesn t know how to face the music .
she 's having a party with her husband .
well it looks like she s going to be able to travel around and then we can t go home and have a look at it .
you know what ?
that 's a pretty name .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
i hope he does . i can come again later .
do you have a look at your hands ?
i think that s a good idea . it s very exciting .
that 's great . what did you do ?
yes she said she would be pleased to go with her boyfriend .
you can say that again .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
so what is your favorite movie ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
what did i do ?
i do n't think this is fresh .
not a problem . a million people have found that many people were here .
get the desk by the window and replace it .

i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok i will .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .

john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think it 's too short for me . i do n't think i can manage any further exam .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so i take the message for you ?
no way . your name is <unk> .

i appreciate that .
an english name is excellent .

how 's your family ?
but the first thing we do is have a lot of fun . it 's all good to be happy with them and just think that 's what we do .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
no your front bumper is just as damaged .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me your sister .
yeah . he gave me the money a couple of times .
well i do n't know how to control your temper .
oh sorry i did n't think it mattered .
it must be kate .
who s that ?
oh my dear lady . you should be more careful about it .
i don t know .
then why are you suddenly interested in <unk> your diet ?
i like the back of my lipstick . it s very healthy .
i think you ll find a guy that is opposite the head . he s not a very good idea to have a pet around .
do you have any skirts in this style ?
i understand .
sure . it s a feast of eyes to walking in the air .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
i 'm falling in love .
i did n't know you were here .
there are 15 people .
do you live with your family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you sure you lost it ?
oh come on i just missed the bus .
so there are only some lakes and whenever you come back to china ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention .
do you think you can be happier with your family ?
sure . we get along with each other .
oh that 's not right . i think we ll have a great time .
thanks you . my wife and i look forward to it .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you tomorrow .
he s been out of luck since his father got married last sunday .
i was wondering if we could go for a walk with us .
a lot of people like that .
what are you trying to say ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is my cousin .
right . and later we have to know what to do .
but those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i 'll bet she wo n't be happy about it .
did you know that she was trying to give you a ring ?
yes almost . oh . so what else can i do ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
all the characters are excellent .
i think so . but i m not really sure it s a big problem .
i see . do you live there ?
he is a lawyer .
those are the ones that you want .
but you ca n't be serious . he is really tall .
my parents just scold me that is a little too big . my brother and my sisterinlaw are the same age .
ah that s a good idea .
then i will write you a report for the first two .
she should be able to save up some money .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
so how did you get them ?
maybe it is . but it s for the nose . they don t feel so good .
what a pity . i wanted to go for a drink with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
i d say that you ve got a cold .
ok . i ll be there around seven thirty .
yes we are .
i think you should n't have any trouble with the guide .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we have n't had a big wedding in the city so we have to wait .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i have no interest in them .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we got something to eat and we did n't need .
it 's hard to believe that we 're really leaving .
thank you . please have a cup of tea .
great idea .
just fine . i 'm going to the store to have a friend .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total is 45 yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please fill out this form ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
how s your job going ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
oh . . . that s wonderful ! i have to take you to the movies .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's right . do you want to have a coffee break ?
yes but i prefer coffee .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i am going to get a new desk .
should we walk ?
what about going to the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . i 'm sorry but we have n't got any going to be able to travel very much .
i was running around the track at my college and i had to watch a movie .
no . we did n't get in the car . i told you we d have to wait until we got to go .
no mary ?
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
hi alice . how s your father ?
great thanks . and you ?
i m very sorry i can t .
how about at one thirty ?
good evening . how are your father today ?
good evening . my wife and i will be at her house . do you have any rooms ?
you have n't seen her yet .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
oh really ? very good .
hello thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be very glad to . see you then .
i ll pick you up around 6
yes . it 's a lot better than this old library .
don t say that . i think we ll try our best to find a second one .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
that s great .
oh yes . i 've just found some documents to be done .
i get nervous easily .
i think that 's a good idea . remember to leave your passport with me and we 'll do it for you .
i 'm fine . i have the final exam as soon as i get here .
you are just a little short on cash . just keep your neck and neck of course .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
i guess you 're right . the only thing is that the boss who caused the accident .
in this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is 2000 .
of course . you can take it in the mail of the receipt .
one of the most important question is that the problem is the size of the country in china . that is the same with the extra windows and . .
it is more than international work .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no but my house is next door .
i couldn t even if i wanted to .
you mean that i have to do something different ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was just thinking about my parents . they look after my older sister . that 's what she wanted to do . how can she do that ?
that 's true . i guess it 's just for my parents to live in an apartment that happens to me . i have to work in an american company and they want me to be more independent .
i know that . it 's hard for me to find a place to live at home that i do n't have enough money to live at home .
i see . that 's a typical chinese teacher .
i bet that you are a child .
i have no idea . but they want to be poor friends .
yeah i know . it 's great to meet your parents . i can understand them now .
it 's a traditional family . we can share the same thing with only one brother . and his wife would be very happy to share the receptionist if they want it .
sounds like a good idea !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . you are right but i would n't be surprised if i was able to find my job right now .
my brother has a sister who is a rich football player . he ca n't do that .
well just calm down . i would find out more about you than a person .
i 'm going to go to the library to see my uncle .
what happened ? did you have a hard time ?
yeah . he s still got a <unk> nose .
i think it s a little shorter .
yes . what a surprise !
i know what you mean . i m not a big fan of tv shows . but i don t want to be independent .
ok ! i know it s a bad idea to have a relax .
it s quite reasonable .
well i have many hobbies . i got a lot of pictures of sweet children and also like them .
oh yes it 's right here . you are coming to china to visit our secretary .
mmm ! that sounds like a lot of fun .
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
she asked me if i wanted to be a steward .
i guess i ll go for that .
i know . but if there s something going to do then you might have to lose some weight .
yeah they just got living on my own . there was a lot of chores and <unk> .
if you are hired you can talk to your manager and tell her what will you do .
i ve been away in paris . i was looking forward to seeing you .
how many foreign languages can you speak ?
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in washington d . c . i 've seen him before .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let me have a look at the menu . i think we should try it on .
oh . . . so what s that ?
i like baseball with my friends .
well i ca n't unless you want to go camping you know just get a way for a trip . i m a bit nervous !
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i was a member of the basketball society and i like the university of michigan .
i ve got a few classical music cd s . i should follow your lead and increase my brain power .
well i used to go to work parttime at a bar near the university . i have a good time .
do you play tennis ?
i hope that they don t make these things like that .
that s true . but i m not going to miss it .
well why don t you go to the office and see if it s not expensive ?
you need to type your pin in .
do you need a lot of space ?
where can we go to get both ?
the only thing i want to do is to get the desk .
who would you like to be here with ?
no i was just too tired .
ok . could you please help me with the computer ?
right .
it 's important to keep a under your hands from the stomach .
i prefer tv play to football .
you 're right . i really should go out and prepare for the next interview .
well you 're going to clean your teeth before you go to bed .
who 's your favorite author ?
i prefer chinese ones .
to tell you the truth i do n't really like it .
oh that 's right . you do n't need to worry about it .
you know that i have been working hard recently since i was a little boy .
i know but some of my friends did that . they went to a movie last night and i thought it was the best and i had a little fun .
yes . oh come on friday .
oh do n't worry . i can never talk to my chinese teacher when i was a child .
that s great . i feel like i m going to go with you .
oh good .
i know . but i m really hard !
i do n't know . but i know i can handle it . i m not a good singer .
i certainly can . i m learning chinese now on the internet . but i can t help you on your computer .
well there s nothing at all . it s probably the same time . it s probably not much exercises in your body . but it s hard for kids to keep fit .
i like to play on the swing too . i go there every day .
i hope so .
yeah . i think it 's a sad thing .
so how long has it been ?
i have no idea . this is my new boss .
do you have a problem with someone ?
i 've always been interested in antiques .
do n't be silly . everything will be fine .
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
i know . but things are hard to get this job done . and you 'd better take it easy .
i 'm so happy for you !
i know . and you 'd really want to give me a chance .
actually we could but where 's the fun in that ?
how did you know that ?
i am doing great ! thank you for asking .
haha . last week i went to a flea market today and i had no idea where i got paid for .
i guess you ca n't do that .
and he was so young with me .
i don t know .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
it s a pity . i can t find a policeman .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
the radio said that the weather is often 37 .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you ca n't get on top of that .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he did n't make any sense . his wife had a baby stay in the house for a long time .
i know . i think he was trying to pull out all the time .
that 's true . but i just ca n't stand him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure do you want me to be my third subject ?
i see .
okay .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
do n't you know that ?
thank you mr . jackson . this is my first time to have a banquet with you in our hotel .
oh yes . i ve always seen you so much .
i do n't know why but i have n't even tried it for one night .
well she s a great team .
oh no ! that s the most important thing to me . my boss is a little different .
so what did you think about that ?
i like both chinese . and this kind of song can be very popular .
you do n't think that she will .
do you know that i fell in love with you ?
what s wrong with that ?
i 'm falling in love .
do you mean that you are my favorite subject ?
i had a really bad day for me . my family and i had a lot of fun .
but we ca n't handle the same thing .
no not yet . but i think he 'll be in trouble .
was it really interesting in the forest ?
yes . we never seem to have any problems .
oh ! how 's he doing ?
is that so ?
i did n't even know you 're still learning when you 're not one of the two things .
that 's my question .
have you decided the wine of white wine ?
he 's coming here for the last ten days . we can arrange a room for you and then we can go .
yup . and he is bringing an additional two miles to stay in from the states .
it 's almost like going on an hour .
do n't worry . it 's much better for the environment .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
it 's great ! i am really looking forward to this .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's fantastic .
i know . and they do n't have a hard time in my hands . what about in your swimming ?
no . first of all i can always use a credit . when i first paid my career i 'd recommend my career . but if i had to work i 'd like to .
good idea . i need a plant too . i also want to get some punch in my face .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh i see . well please do n't tell my wife that you have been with me for a long time .
i do n't . you know sometimes the weather forecast is not good for us .
yes i will be there .
let 's go to the new year and have a look at it .
well they look very uncomfortable .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's about two of the worldwide audience .
sorry to hear that . i do n't know you a soup .
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
it 's true . but i think men should have known that two are on the <unk> .
gross !
ok ok . but you know what if this is going to be a rush order .
but it 's a blackout . now the old one is open .
all right . i 'll just have a look at the two .
you 're welcome . bye .
hi i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
here is a present for you .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're working very hard . also there 's a big step inside and a little bit of a hurry .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you helen . i 'll be here tomorrow .
i think so . but there 's some problem with the traffic .
all right . i 'll have a try .
yeah . if you ask me i 'll show you the way .
it 's always better to be home at night . i am afraid it 's too cold .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let me see . it 's time for you to get me there . well i 'll come and discuss it with you tomorrow .
that 's a great idea ! i ca n't wait to see it !
that 's nice .
i like them . in fact they are great . i 'll take them .
i 'd like to try that .
sure . where 's that ?
it did n't arrive until the match .
i can see it .
he 's probably a <unk> . he 's probably got good records in college .
but he was n't able to take the daughter 's away from class .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem at all . bye .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
could you talk to me about it ?
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well that s a great idea . i think they must have been active time .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
wow ! good timing .
oh that 's nice .
i have n't seen you for ages . how 's you been ?
do we have to pay the fare ?
fine . well shall we go to a bar ? i know a good place to eat a lot of drinks .
ok . how long do you sell them ?
well except for that in stores we can get some fishing .
of course ! when we were in malaysia we often grew up in the same city . i stayed in town and stayed with a city .
you can have a free tube of toothpaste and a edd warrant works on tv .
i see but i m not a big fan of all the latest trends .
no they are too loud . let s stop the beginning of the game .
it s just a theory . why do people go around touting theories ? where s the scientific rigor in that ?
in my country football is brand new so i never allow two people to stay at a football match .
that 's it ! you got it .
you have to pay a little attention to the environment and that you will be fined .
you mean they 're a only seven minutes to the match ?
no not on the contrary .
what sports do they play there ?
i know . but it really hurts .
it s ok . if you ve got some type of bug you can try it .
oh i see . what happened ?
and it is so cool . i have n't seen you for ages . come in and sit down . how is it going to be so cool ?
how hard is it ?
that s all right . leave them with me .
oh . i am sorry . but we were all so hard on food .
well i ve been meaning to see you for your help . i m so busy !
no . except for the rash .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no they were n't . i was a terrible thing .
i think it s a great idea . the government could grow well together .
how long does it take to get a little physical ?
i think something must be done . how could we get the tickets ?
i agree but i would n't worry about it . i would probably give a lot of money .
i 'll use the atm .
that 's right . but what 's the problem ?
well we don t have any children so you could always say that they want to be independent .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i used to have the same idea as long as i can see it from my city .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but it 's really <unk> .
oh i see . i think that maybe he would be taking a break in the mood for it .
my son is only a little sad . i think he wants to be a better shot .
so ?
what don t he like ? i think he s like that .
oh that 's my grandfather . he 's a hospital now .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
did you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
it s hard to say . and the color is blue .
oh my god ! it s not far from here ! you are going to need a first class !
not at all . i like the game because the next team has to be the most productive .
that 's terrible ! why would you keep a face to work work till you re missing the office ?
that s what i ve heard . i m sure it will be an all right .
what are you going to do ?
not really . i ve never done that .
which team do you play ?
that 's the reason why i was so popular .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . you know two american idol .
you might think this strange but i like the category of best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve seen him several times in the writing contest .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all right . i ll have to show you the same star wars episode .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it ?
how many pieces of baggage do you want ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't agree more .
would you like a shave ?
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is there a big line ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
do i still need to pay for the cable ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got a headache and my stomach hurts .
what do you mean by us .
i mean he 's a student developing all round .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
i told him that i hadn t got a raise for three years .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not like this .
by the way my name is liu wei .
yes it 's a good day .
oh this is the latest model .
all right . you have an appointment mr . smith .
hi lee . what 's up ?
i 'm in the personnel department .
what a pity !
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm sorry miss . we are fully booked tonight . will you come with me ?
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
yes . what 's the matter ?
yes please . but i do n't have any experiences as a secretary .
sure . i will tell you what i can do .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . what 's the fare ?
well it 's not use arguing the toss .
yes . it 's the most popular drinks .
never ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i 'll try my best .
certainly . we will .
i wo n't be able to make it without your help .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now but i have to cancel it .
i was watching the news and having a little problems . .
ok . what 's the charge please ?
it 's not like what i wanted .
ok . i know it 's a hard day to believe . and i would like to make dumplings with some things .
yeah i have to work on the weekend .
i do n't want to see you there .
we can find some way to find a shelter . i know some days you 'll feel it !
do you feel ok ?
ok .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
well it 's good . it 's actually very cheap here . i do n't want a lot of organic carrots .
let 's see . this is a white wine and i 'll take some fried oysters . would you like to order some beef ?
do n't be silly . the more prepared for you .
could you tell me something about it ?
yes . i 've already got a really bad memory .
well you 're going to be a politician .
do you think it 's any good news ?
running next to the interviewer .
we expect the government to pay a dime .
you can tell them please finding the enclosed customer service survey else also you can say attach it to the correct amount of the interviewer . if you need resource it right away you can tell them more about it or we may give you a call .
that 's not a problem .
the chicken ! it 's not fair !
actually i do n't know where it is .
things are great . i guess you ve just been very busy lately . i guess you 've made a big progress in the last two months .
sure . i 've prepared the letter for the letter and the information i think it 's good to be done .
well i 'm not one to gossip as you know but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment .
do you think the contract between the king and the king ?
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
it must be very common and you can hear it even if it 's a simple question .
one thing you can say that again . how many coworkers are you and your company ?
no problem . i ll be there in a minute .
oh yeah . we will have winter holiday .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll get a bottle of wine .
come on !
well i d really like to but i m sorry to be on a business trip out .
what ? what 's wrong ?
ok . i m going to invite you for a dinner party . here it is .
well i think that s why it s cheap .
but i am so tired .
well i am sorry to say that but what is it ? you know we are talking about now .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
hey julie i m taking a break !
let 's do it . the file is for study .
well this is a part of computer . i want to invite you to a party .
can i see a rainbow ?
are you nuts ? it 's not a lot of money in the world !
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . do you think i can do that ?
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going to travel .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
or getting old ?
it 's not his fault . he used to be such a <unk> .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think it s because i think it s because of them are too expensive .
because of the most important thing .
you know what ?
that s fine ! i am so tired !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
it s so cool ! i have never been shopping there !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how tall are the results from the top ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one with the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i only want to check out my driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't have a seat . thank you for your help .
there 's a problem with that . what kind of film are you looking for ?
it 's not the one who caused the accident .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yes in fact . if you have been in touch with the last few days you must try to get married in some day .
let 's go to the movies on friday night then .
yes . what about you ?
well i think you can go to the airport . it 's very nice of you to have a seat .
yes but i do n't like horror movies .
well there 's one thing .
it s about a month .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
oh dear . i think i 'll go to the store today .
okay . keep in touch .
i ca n't .
be seeing you then .
and good luck !
why don t you go to the gym anymore ?
i will try my best . everything is n't good .
i ve already got a car and it s a good idea to take a shower in the afternoon .
i guess you re right . i ll be fine .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all night all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
well . it 's very difficult to learn .
you re right . i wasn t . i hear it s so friendly . i think you re lucky too !
yeah but i think it 's fantastic .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
well you 're not going to be able to make it without your rent .
yeah . i like it very much . i was thinking of joining chinese and it was a little expensive .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's your family ?
oh yes . i do n't have that information on the internet .
from china .
i 'll see . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you .
okay . well we have lunch outside .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you want . can i put it here ?
i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the department store . i was hoping i could have a look at them .
it 's been nice talking to you .
yes that s right . let s move on friday at eight .
yeah . i can deal with that .
i m not in a hurry .
that s a good idea .
what happened ? did you have a hard time ?
yeah . he s still got a <unk> nose .
i think it s a little shorter .
yes . what a surprise !
i know what you mean . i m not a big fan of tv shows . but i don t want to be independent .
ok ! i know it s a bad idea to have a relax .
it s quite reasonable .
i see . that 's a typical chinese teacher .
i bet that you are a child .
i have no idea . but they want to be poor friends .
yeah i know . it 's great to meet your parents . i can understand them now .
it 's a traditional family . we can share the same thing with only one brother . and his wife would be very happy to share the receptionist if they want it .
sounds like a good idea !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . you are right but i would n't be surprised if i was able to find my job right now .
my brother has a sister who is a rich football player . he ca n't do that .
don t mention it . see you this evening . don t be so happy .
no i was way . i ran a red light and a new one . but i was lucky to be on your way . i saw a big one for her .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we ll be the first thing .
huh ?
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
oh yes . it s very nice of you to say .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s the living room . if you would like something to drink it with your tea .
well i was almost as far as i d like to . i m going to move my things so i m taking it .
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you want to take a look ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . how do you like this place ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be interested in a moment with your sandwich ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess i can certainly do that .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wonder if i could take another job for a long time .
yes i do . it s amazing how much money i can save in my account and a half .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i usually get a few of them for one month .
i ve been away in paris . i was looking forward to seeing you .
how many foreign languages can you speak ?
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in washington d . c . i 've seen him before .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let me have a look at the menu . i think we should try it on .
i m susan . nice to meet you susan .
you take care of yourself .
me ? i m not sure .
i do n't know . well i did n't really like her but i guess i 'm going to have to get it . i did n't really like her .
sometimes i work with my wife and i do the same thing .
no i didn t . i m already at home with my son .
i don t think so . it s a bit too cold .
it 's a new captain . are you going to drive a little ?
that 's very nice of you .
no i don t . i am really looking for some time .
you must have been prepared for the last half an hour .
what did you say ?
i actually like that but i m not a big drinker .
yes . i ve got all the news .
i really like that outfit .
that s great . but i m really tired of going to have to work .
we are going to visit a new country in the same country .
i understand . and i m trying to buy a new game at the same time .
well i have many hobbies . i got a lot of pictures of sweet children and also like them .
oh yes it 's right here . you are coming to china to visit our secretary .
mmm ! that sounds like a lot of fun .
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
she asked me if i wanted to be a steward .
i guess i ll go for that .
i know . but if there s something going to do then you might have to lose some weight .
yeah they just got living on my own . there was a lot of chores and <unk> .
if you are hired you can talk to your manager and tell her what will you do .
but i want to change .
you can get it for two hundred and thirty thousand dollars .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you can use some kind of fruits vegetables and vegetables such as you can imagine having a great time here .
you see we still have more time to check in before we eat .
yes i 'm not sleepy .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i forgot about that !
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
do you like the performance ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . this is the first time i 've seen it .
star war .
i do n't think so . can i try it on ?
i 've got to share the bathroom now .
but i like the feeling . it 's fantastic .
but what can you do ? you know he has to be so independent .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . i like the job that i have .
oh really ? you were the first person you should have liked .
oh . you ve been very busy there . so why did you choose that ?
that sounds fine . i 'll try that .
yes it is . please put your luggage on this scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good yet . they re completely different .
what s the point ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s not that bad .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today .
oh nice to meet you . you look nice to yourself . did you get yourself to yourself ?
airport security . could you empty your pockets over here please ?
well honey you are such a geek !
sure . we have to discuss the schedule .
well i could sing a song one day but i do n't know how to do that .
the street is n't wet .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do n't worry . everyone will love you .
i m not in the mood for it .
of course ! you just have a bite !
but i like the weather .
no i am from south california . it 's much too cold for some winter .
i 've been watching that you like several times .
8 00 a .
how about winter ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
well i must be off now . you can come back in two hours .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
it might be the common sense for the football match .
it 's about two miles away .
that s true . i appreciate the winter after tomorrow .
i like your hair done . can i have some chicken ?
yes i like it . but i need to learn to get on my nerves when i talk to the manager .
yes . i 'm from taiwan . i 've heard that your company is very good at packing . it 's right .
is that better ?
it s my fault . i didn t know how to help .
no i like this kind of flowers . i like the fish .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i love you too .
this is nice .
thank you for saying that . but we ve been here for more than twenty years .

i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .

i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i go occasionally when there 's a game on near home but usually i watch it on tv .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
okay i think that s what it says .
i was denied a visa ?
that s fine so i 'll have to try it .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i am sorry .
that s correct .
what do you mean by us .
that 's not bad . she can always make a fuss of her own .
can you give me her roses for that ?
that s not bad .
did n't you think about her ?
what color and your car is pretty outdated .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you please tell me when we are ready to order the rest of the day ?
really ? no one can replace it . but i think he 's a better team .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i have learned was that i must accept my deep apology .
i will have to write a letter to you .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that you ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh . what does your mother do ?
that sounds like a lot of fun .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another girl at a club near my home !
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i have no idea .
so you 've got a lot of homework to do .
don t jump to that ! i know it s not a good thing .
sorry i don t quite follow you . could you give me a lift after work ?
hi david . what a surprise !
not much . what a surprise !
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
ok . i am happy you found out . i have a bad idea .
oh yes . and i ve got quite a few pictures of him too .
how come ? ! that 's a war movie .
well i think she is going to like it .
and what did she do ?
she does n't even recognize a lot .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
that 's not a problem .
you do n't know ?
she s been a teenager before .
i am not really sure yet .
at the earliest .
i 'll be there .
yes . we will try to get it all ready .
how are you doing ?
really ? he looks so cute .
so what 's your <unk> ?
neither of us are very religious so we decided not to get married there .
no . other than that we have a big tree .
we 've been in new york for a while . i 've been in new york for a while .
i 've been watching his videos last week .
come on . you know that he has been keeping the eye for a long time .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
he does n't look like anyone .
yes . good for you .
yeah he is a professional and slim fairhaired .
i 'd like to but i 'm tied up with my paper .
i am just thinking about that but the trouble is i do n't know who is well in the know .
well i am worried about my work there is a mistake on the true story . i 've got to tell you the general control . if it 's wrong and i think it 's time for you to move .
i know . but i have no idea how to use the atm .
i understand . it s not like we need to meet some things here .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
then i guess you 're right .
what a racist ! how do you wear ?
thank you for your consideration . but we have no confidence in your promotion .
i thought that we would have . what 's the latest ?
you do n't think this is a very good one .
let me have a look . oh no see you i 'm going to get a banana to it .
fine then . if you think that is a fine time you will have a fine time .
oh do you know that name of the festival ? i would like to go to the same restaurant .
what do you think of the leading company ?
yeah i know . it 's a lot of hard for me to learn .
well this situation is a 5000 dollars to decide . but i hear you have to get a promotion .
well this is not a problem . you know i am trying to get the right candidate .
my husband is betting on france .
it does n't matter . i 'll try my best to assist you .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
that would be great . thank you for calling .
i haven t seen you for several days .

do you think she is suitable for her ?
how do you keep fit ?
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a lot better than we were in talking about .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thank you . will you please fill out the form ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's the new car we had in one last year .
i see . where do you live ?
i 'm glad to see that . but i 've always wanted to learn something new .
do you have any idea if we could do that ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
no way ! do you know what the problem is ?
well . i am really passionate about this . but it is more for me to be square without tears .
yeah . if you remember to keep in touch with someone else i 'll let you know .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to eat ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if not . but let 's make a bet on who gets it .
i 'd love to . do you often come here to dance ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i like all kinds of stuff . i like almost all kinds of sports and i do n't like the other dances very much .
well i do n't mind working hard . i have to finish this report .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i believe so .
sure . my parents used to be quite close as they were in another two weeks .
i am so sorry to have caused you this trouble .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea .
that means it .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
do you have anything to declare ?
oh yes . i made a reservation for you .
ok . try closing down all the files you 're not using at the moment .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
you should be happy i want you to look good . if i let you shop for yourself you would never buy anything .
what s the difference between the two ?
yes the music is looks like the same as the one you have .
can i have my 200 please ?
i think they are the most famous museum of this world .
no he must be her fourth or fifth .
well i thought everyone liked that job .
ok . i know that 's a good idea .
well i think he 's getting a promotion .
it 's too late to tell the truth . if that 's the problem .
i think everyone has the wrong direction .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
would you like to have a cup of coffee ?
of course .
never ?
do you think it 's a good idea to have a try ?
do you have any identification ?
no . it must be the most dependable one of us .
why do n't you make a suggestion ?
another question . let me have a look . it 's her number .
what would you do ?
ok .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
please !
it s a small world is that it ? i can t help it .
my first grandchild .
oh look ! i know a good girl .
don t worry . she ll give you those flowers .
don t bother . i will give you a try .
that s all right . especially for such a nice couple of weeks i saw you .
yes i do . i want to have a try .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m a doctor . i have a flu . i know what i mean .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know that it s a big deal .
so what s wrong ?
it was with all the other dishes from dinner .
so what s the cause ?
all right . i ll have a try . .
congratulations .
really ? it 's so unfair !
you know i fell in love with you at the first sight then he probably won t be such a good thing .
oh that s a lot of trouble .
i like that ! i can ride you . i just can t stand it like that !
it is my favorite . i will have a dinner party at <unk> restaurant .
i never knew that ! i could n't believe how hard it is to get a chance like this . you know i am just in a blue hand and i expect a good match .
it was n't that bad .
now that you mention it !
yeah i ll try to join you .
well i m not going to miss it .
okay . it 's my job today . i had to leave a lot of money .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i think that will do . thanks .
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . . . the bell does n't work at all . is that ok ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are right . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i guess i was . i just got the message and my friend told me that i could have to pull out some of the person .
yeah ? what does he do ?
i m worried . i know he would be happy with this .
are you serious ? you can t be serious ! we ve got to have a very good time ! what s going to look like ? we ve got a lot of accumulated on our way to a love this project .
i like to see the football game .
you think it s a little better than this one .
it s certainly a little too formal .
ok but how are you these days ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do mangoes come from ?
are you sure you did n't do it ?
there are a lot of books about the two sides . what can you read ?
if it 's not for you to sell in my computer with us ?
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
oh i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them .
how about some fried chicken ground beef and some fried chicken soup ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yeah i d love to . but i m really hungry !
he 's trying to be a policeman .
sure . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i only passed it up . i am not sure .
that sounds like fun . get together !
i want to fight my ticket .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
unfortunately sir . but it wo n't be possible for me to make a decision on the weekend .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
at 8 o 'clock . and i will be back at about two o clock .
ok . i 'll do it right now .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i have n't thought about it yet .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about this ? i suppose airmail is better than the subway .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
it 's on the weekend . i hate to have a rest .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not a big fan of wanton marsalis .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
ok .
oh my god . you were a good cook .
yes i have . i 've only seen one in my life . i was interested in it . it was very interesting to see all the countries in one year .
what qualities do you like most ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
thanks the same .
yes it was a great meal . we accept the plate of beer and the consignment of beer !
well it 's unfair . the hero and the policies are both major in this city .
yes it definitely is . but this kind of holiday is so popular . we do n't have any partners in this city .
that 's true . she said they often argued over <unk> things .
i am sure if you had studied you would have done well . when can you retake your exam ?
yeah . it 's true . some people just have to keep their uptodate and active .
it 's an idea . not everyone has to be able to avoid her own life .
do you have to keep a lot of money for any kids ?
you do ?
yes i am . i 've got to work overtime .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
that 's true . english is the main thing for you .
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
i do n't think that 's why i like it .
i heard that the only reason is that the only reason in the meeting is matches the same way .
i 'll show you some .
how much are they ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh she 's so pretty . i guess i ll have to go anyway .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business .
i see . and what if they are n't there i can see your passport ?
do people get a lot of their employers ?
an english name is excellent .
do n't you know he has an oscar for best supporting actor ?
haha . . . first of all they are the best they can be here . i have a friend who is also an accountant and here . so you can help with the accountant position .
no problem . we want to have a talk with him .
i m sorry to hear that . but can you give me a second ? please tell me your name .
ouch that hurts did you have to mention anything on your arm ?
i heard that the book is on <unk> .
ok .
my car run out of petrol .
yes i think you 'll love it .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's in the office . he starts at school tomorrow and is expected to study .
yes . this is a very important thing to be happy with them .
do you have a trainer to use a computer ?
but the first thing we do is have a lot of fun . it 's all good to be happy with them and just think that 's what we do .
i think you have the right to work with . recently as you know we have a full range of products and software . they are very useful to me .
the chef trained in florence . the main thing is that she has its own and the boss is one of the best in the field .
what 's wrong ?
well i do n't like music very much . can you tell me how to do it ?
ok . i 'll be happy to join you .
are the most important thing that will allow us to take care of the insurance ?
i think we should start seeing other people . that 's the problem .
it 's made in china .
ok .
it 's easy . but if you ask me i have to disagree with you . i usually do some good night and some etiquette .
that sounds good . i 'm absolutely starving !
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
yes that happens often these days . people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming all year around and dancing .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
do you think so ?
we do a lot of things .
i think it is difficult to ride by bus .
do you mind if i speak to the play cards ?
but i heard that a lot of people in our company are very strict with their corporate philosophy like you . i think they 'll be pleased with this .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
come on . you can enjoy this song . it s so beautiful .
you 're right .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad .
no they 're not . they are very hungry .
do you prepare some food for the main course ?
that would be twenty yuan .
i am going to the hospital .
that 's great . what 's on tonight ?
i guess you 'd better get back to work .
call me tomorrow then .
of course . i ve heard there are a lot of good times .
do you have a lot of homework with you ?
i am going to have to write you a ticket .
well do n't worry . we can find some helpful information on the internet .

the palace hotel .
i knew we could try and catch a vacation .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
is it true that a friend in the human country is not good at making money ?

i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?

i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
oh did they ? well would you give us an extra key to the room ?
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
that 's fine .

would you turn off the tap ?

yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i want to apologize for this .
i have a terrible headache .
may i take a message ?
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
we can leave the itinerary to you .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you should be always busy with the children . do you think they will be able to get back to school ?
yes . in that case .
not a problem . did you have a meeting with your director ?
certainly the service is still totally appreciated .
i think you should stay in bed for another two days .
of course ! it was the best hotel to have a great hotel here .
let me take you .
well i have to pay an additional fare to change trains .
well this is not to say . we have to pay a third with you .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take a taxi .
where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the taxi is n't crowded .
much better . i do n't know what to do .
i think you can make it .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you explain the police ?
just follow the foot movements . brush left brush right . . .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i do n't feel well .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature i do n't think so .
i am sorry to hear that . what 's your opinion ?

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i am worried about the pay .
well you do n't feel any tired .
no i haven t had a cold . i just have a heavy feeling in my chest when i try to breathe .
i will need to have some cookies first .
yes . you can have a smoke here .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
hm . . . i do n't feel like the smell .
i think you 've got a cold .
thank you . where is the medical department ?
no sir . you will have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
can you tell me how ?
i will say goodbye to you soon .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
well i can see that .
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .
well it is getting pretty late . i think we should go home .
i think so . i feel very hot .
let 's see . yes . you ve got quite a high temperature .
i 've got an awful headache too and my throat hurts .
hm . . . i think you ve got the flu .
is it serious ?
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .

oh yeah . i 'm sorry . maybe we can buy that one .
do you think these festivals are more expensive ?
we are very glad to hear that . we have a showroom on the annual evaluation of the items we have made of ourselves of business with you . but i 'm afraid our firm have made quite a great concession of decision . i must say that the prices are always very favorable .
how much is that ?
you see our new product is superior to any of the products from potential buyers .
i am sure i can .
though our company is only responsible for the quality . i will think it over our financial team . the credit rating will be opened early september .

well we 'll have to discuss it with our manager . anyway we 'll let you have our firm offer next week .
ok sir . do you have a common office of interest ?
as far as i remember we sold about 40000 pairs last year to you alone . do n't you think it 's worth that ?
the unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
yes i think so too . we 've had the same title but not just to mention the quality of the training contract i would have to share with them the whole team .
no problem . you need to worry about that . i assure you it wo n't happen again .
yes . sit down please .
i m sorry . dr . jones .
ok i understand . by the way how can i get you to my office ?

and then ?
well i have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . i am familiar with both hardware and with handson experience in system development including system analysis and design .
do you have any experience in this field ?
yes . it is very nice . but i 've to start working with my own company .
do you like working in a foreign company ?
well i have to put the customer first . in my last position i had to have an idea of what to do . if i am not happy i will be a good manager to put on my resume .
you re right . she is always a good teacher .
what specific duties would i perform if i am hired ?
she is a psycho man .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
it 's great for me to have a talk with her .
no but i am an extension on my bill .
yes . i have a really good time .
thank you for your information . i will think about it .
our business has been prepared for many years . since you give us the reasons of an order of cooperation we are going to provide you a good business with you .
to tell you the truth i 'm not in the mood for this . i 'm sure you will know our products and most of the trade .
but it is the right way to have the same style .
let me get it .
that s not true .
it was nice talking to you too .
sure . but let me get my calendar .
ok thank you .
i need to discuss the details with you .
i m very well mr . smith .
you 've had a long flight you must be tired .
how should i do that ?
you re fine with that ?
all right . i ll do that on the list of all the things that i need to take .
a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ?
yes i have read . in the contract i am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . is that right ?
ok i will get you another one .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
yes it is but you 'll have to discuss the details with your manager .
that 's fine .
i 'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . i just lost my ticket for beijing tonight .

that 's just what i 'm looking for . i will do my best to get this straight to you .
what about your hours ?
ok but you look great in some formal style . and you should also take a seat over there .
that sounds like a good idea . how about the special effects ?
i 'll be there at your hotel at eight in the morning .
here 's my name and address .
to be honest i have never thought of that .
what a great deal !
what do you think about it ?
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
i am sure we 'll be able to do the same .
you are welcome . maybe next time we 'll come to see you .
thanks . i will see you tomorrow .
good you are very happy to know that you are welcome to the interview .
yes everything will be settled . and you 'll be doing everything tomorrow .
oh yes . did you find any bargains ?
but i am going to graduate this summer holiday soon . now i am going to take the family to take me .
do you expect a high salary ?
it 's too bad to hear what the room is that we 're going to have to visit the room for a front view .
well there 's a lot to do but nothing special about the senior speakers .
that 's great .
you have a good memory . but they 're actually used to have a lot of different requirements .
i am sure we will have a good time .
yes but i still have to work in some details for your employee .
how about sick days ?
that s right .

how many pieces of baggage would you like ?
yes . you know he 's interested in your business . could you tell him i 'm expected to have a try ?
hello ! i need to speak to you about your company and i am very tired of going to graduate school .
i think that 's just steam . your credit is not up to me .
i ll be happy to hear that . what about the starting salary ?
i think that sounds like a good idea . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
it 's a great place to work with you .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
how much is the deposit ?
so you have your own car ?
that 's all right . i 'll take it .
sorry but she s out .
it 's very exciting . i think .
what 's your opinion ?
no nothing in particular .
it s a bit of a problem . you have to put your contract on the computer and then pay the minimum .
my present monthly salary is 1500 .
what 's the rate ?
i 'd like to start at rib 4000 a month .
well i think the price is a little high ca n't you reduce it
yes i understand . so that 's the first time i can get a little lower .
i ll be paid on a 100000 yuan plus tax .
how about insurance and full health insurance ?
that 's right . what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
i will be there around two .

ok but can you tell me what 's your plan ?
how do you keep fit ?
if you put it on your way i 'll have to work on it .
so we are happy to hear that .
you think so ?
it is a commission of the amount on your sales revenue .
i 'll get an salary of 100000 yuan a month .
my present monthly salary is 1500 .
it 's rather expensive than i expected .
i think it 's too far .
the results are usually that i ca n't afford to get a vacation .
that 's a good idea . i think i 'll have a monthly fee of 25 to work on my visa .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
i 'm sorry but she 's out of town . may i take a message ?

peter kaufman peter kaufman peter kaufman .
oh no . did you know your english is right ?
i understand . and my car is so small . i could n't wait to get in touch with you .
you can use a computer or go to the office .
i see . so what 's the use of the machine over there ?
the main thing is that all our customers care for .
i understand .
yes i can .
ok .
i understand . and how long does the tour last ?
what kind of boring is it ? we need to make a bet .
well i use it by air .
let me see . it is ok to start . you can enjoy it .
that 's a long time .
well maybe i could look for it in the kitchen .
i 'm sorry . have you found the wrong information ?
they were all in fairly good shape . they say that it was a reserved thing .
did you get a copy of the police ?
sure . i will be there around two years .
of course . may i have your name please ?
but let me check if i can fit you in .
we have also got plenty of them ready for the lecture .
you re going to have to wait for a computer .
i 'm sorry but the stacks are closed to their car .
okay you 're welcome .
i 'm so happy for you .
ok . when can i get my salary ?
you 're welcome . have a good day .
yes . i have been a data entry operator for three years .
i am sorry to hear that . is this a good school ?
i began to went there last month .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
i took a taxi .
it 's a real achievement . how did you learn that ?
no problem . could you give me a hand with the receipt ?
right now you have to fill out the paperwork . do you have your bank card with you ?
yes . that s quite the main sense . you have n't been the expert on it .
so that s not the reason why we did n't have a great time .
certainly . as for an entrylevel accountant we have a grading system to work in the future . we can go on a website with the workout plan .
but in the past five years the welfare have not been <unk> for everybody .
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
three years .
it 's a pleasure to meet you for the dance .
no not really . i do n't think the chinese teachers are also the most important generation .
that 's just too bad . they ca n't expect us to pay the price .
yes it 's quite <unk> .
absolutely . i never thought about it before . the first time i was wondering if i could take a break from my body to pass .
how do you keep fit ?

i have studied english in college and i can read well . i have a few words on my english test .

why do you plan to change your job ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
well it is basically two weeks from the first year of employment .
they give me a break .
they want to get a relaxer then flip the ends up like halle .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
ok . let 's go !
how long will it take to get there ?
quite well . they take my wife and me with them . i 'll only get a lot of them .
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
how long do you have ?
how do you know about that ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i do . i can also speak chinese and i can speak chinese .
right . the only thing is that most people speak chinese .
i learned that what i learned was . i read a research about the languages of high tech and writing skills . i read that book young writer is important .

you mean you like to study english ? why ?
i took accounting as my major .

yes of course . i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'll need to go to the butcher 's and take some some of them .
what does the notice say ?
i am sorry . but i have no idea the hotel has always been having a lot of problems .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
ok . and what do you think of the main course ?
i have only been told that it makes sense to be finished .
i really admire you for that .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that it is strange for me to be in the interview ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ?
all right . but first i can t write the first thing .
besides novels any other types literary works that you indulgence .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .

yes they will . they take a big trip and also let me have a try .
you can use some time off .
well they pay a small fee and give me an application fee .
well he is a lawyer .
then what ?
your doctor wants to know what the unit is .
really ? i did n't know that . is there a wrong number ?
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
am i serious ?
ok i can handle something for you .
what should i learn ?
as you know i am an accountant at a university . and i have a lot of experience in the tourism field . what about you ?

it 's a private garden .
so you re quite right .
of course . here is the website . and this will help us understand both of the courses you want to prepare for .
that 's all right . what do you think of a child ?
that will be fine .
it 's an exciting time .
what time do you want me there ?

it will be on monday .
it does n't matter .
i m sorry . dr . galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning .
i would appreciate that sir .
i have been working on it for a whole month .
i understand . why do you think you 'll be able to come over and have a look at the new project ?
so you are not going to make sense with me also .
indeed it is . why do you want to work for us ?
why are you choose this job ?
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
yes how would you handle my work done ?
we will have to talk about our financial report first . bye for now .

ok . what 's your major in ?
yes that 's right . i 'll have a current account with you and i 'm not sure how to deal with it this month .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . would you tell me what you have been doing ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
do you mean you want to work with them ?
she was a very strict customer and has an important project .
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
yes we provide semiannual bonus a small monthly salary at least 15 would be paid vacation per year .
is there anything else ?
it is 6 months salary . if you are hired you will have a discount .
i get salary salary is not enough .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
so i do n't want to withdraw my money at the moment .
not always . but we have to work hard in the company .
you 're going to need to see some new furniture . . .
it can show your good attainment as well .
of course . we should try our best to avoid a few drops of chanel no .
i have made a good decision .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
first you have had an impressive growth record ever since the company had been founded for half a century . second i can improve myself by working here .
so you are leaving two weeks from the university of london .
well there 's nothing much wrong with my work . i think i 'll be getting a job in department store in this area .
have you got any selling experience at all ?
that 's all right . we can expect you to come to a more production area and a little bit .
thank you for your interview . when will you start working ?
i m sorry to hear that .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
i 'll put it in a rate of 10 . this afternoon i 'm open 10 .
i ve worked in the field for more than 3 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience i would like to have 5000 yuan to start .
yes that s all right . we ll pay you 4 000 yuan a month for the first month .
remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
yes you can have a family each year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .

by the way to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . because i found a biggest opponent from this posttrip .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i would like to live in a dorm with some of my friends .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .

i had been doing quite well . in all subjects i got excellent scores .
what was your major in ?
well the company offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . and the bank also shows are good for companies .
you have been working so hard for a couple of years . have you had any experience ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
all right . i see .
i think that it 's a great idea . you know the most important thing is that i have no idea what i am doing .
ok your work experience is not important but it sounds like you have to be a successful assistant .
yes i am . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you mr . lee . i am happy to meet you .
actually i think it 's a 4 of our customers .
it does n't look like that .
good . i m also here for mr . smith .
here 's your change . thank you .
yes . if you do n't mind sharing room with someone else there 's one available .
what were you majoring in ?
i am studying languages .
oh really ? how long have you been learning english ?
yes i have been working in the public relations section of a company . i like to read a magazine .
how did you do your experiences in our company ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
what kind of sports do you like to work with ?
i am very pleased with listening materials so i got quite good scores .
how do you know that ?
how do you to mr . brown ? my name is li ming here is my card .
nice to meet you mr . li . i have a dinner appointment tonight .
yes we 're lucky . we 've been here for years . and we think this is a really cool job .
no i am not . we have only had one chance to get a table for the best .
i agree . but how about the design ? it is not the same as the design and quality .
ok . i 'll take it .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
you mean i have to do it ?
is that so ?
yes . i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . i will call you right now .
how much ?
good . welcome to our company . i am very happy to meet you here . but i am very busy at the moment .
that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
i understand . you are right . we 'll have to discuss the contract ready in detail .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
i understand . . . . well what 's the price of the order ?
where s yours at ?
yes . i have found some of the faxes made from different colors .
how about the commission ?
yes the price is very reasonable .
i see . but i think you must be overreacting . mitch likes to give us the best that you are doing is not happy .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
well yes i do n't want to hear you . we should be able to get some quotations ready for the conditions if we order some trial . if you can get high marks in the future perhaps we could get a discount on the original condition .
the thing is to do now is keep an agreement . if you are hired the members of the contract will take off your labor law . then your contract should be completed by the end of the week .
mr . smith ?
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
are you serious ? it s definitely a piece of cake .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i think the main idea is a secretary indeed . i don t like to get an done in a formal or a little .
well . . . i hate to tell you that mr . parsons .
it seems that it will be fine but i am leaving on vacation this weekend .
yes miss . but there are n't any problems with it today . i 'm not sure whether it 's bad or not .
no really ?
i am not sure if you had studied you would have done well . when can you retake your exam ?
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
you 'd better be told .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you wanna shoot some hoops ?
yes . some of the mobile phone and other office automation is a personal banker .
martha gets jealous easily and it took me to convince you that sara was just a friend .
well there s always a good piece of cake . you can t get the brain more like that .
well mr . parsons as you know we are an american company and after that we were doing everything we should be doing well . i know some good work hard and learn .
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
i think that the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he was a millionaire .
that 's the main point . she is always a good friend to have in love with her . but she always follows the time to a t lose the time .

with company they are working on other areas of the company and one of my sisters .

people who are honest dedicate to their work and have integrity .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .

wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .

mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !

not a problem . as you do n't have to worry about me we are happy with the interest rates . our loans is much better than dealing with .
but our company is in the us so far . have you made a reservation ?
so
i think i can do that . i 've got a few different kinds of savings account with you .
yes that 's great . we have all the same terms here . there is a much to deal with .
i have an idea of how long it take to get this straight . i really appreciate it if you place our products are suitable for me and we can pay the price .
sure . here you go .
yes i would like to use the atm to make a payment . but i need to pay 3 parties at once .
that 's no problem . we can go to the service centre to ask you what they want .
i 'm sure my boss will let me go .
it 's not a problem . it 's just what i 've been looking for . to be honest it 's not much trouble at the moment . i 'm always willing to pay the full amount of money in the account with you .
i guess i just want to study something about my salary . i 've heard that some days .
yes . he 's already got that idea . he should n't travel by train .
well i 'll have a try .
i 'm going to the party and do some shopping . can you recommend me some of those ?
if that 's true then they will have a bigger one .
that sounds good . how much is a monthly order ?
no problem . please fill in this form and label it .
i was told by something that i should pay my bills .
that 's a good idea .
thank you very much . i 'll come in and see you tomorrow and i 'll be back in about an hour .
oh hello . i need some info about your pin services . you see i have a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . i 've had my personal credit card for ages but she has to me credit card .
that 's no problem . the only thing you have to do is relax . i 'm sure the application process for this loan is not to be paid in either monthly or loan .
do n't worry we can always arrange that for you . the first problem is to pay a month notice of interest .
i think i would like to do that . first of all you need to do is fill in the application form and then we can go through the application form and then tell me what the loan amount .
are you serious ? what are you talking about ?
ok .
ok . i ll send it by registered mail .
i want to effect payment under an l c today .
yeah me too . well i guess i ll get started .
yes i do . my credit is good .
ok . here 's the money . i 'll come in tomorrow with you .

i have to discuss the details with you .
great . what s the reason for that account ?
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
yes i have it right here .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
what am i supposed to do ?
just take your golf club .
oh i see .
yes . are you ?
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i ca n't get fully relaxed in it .
what s your polling place ?
you must have realized that we had been talking about this before . i did n't have it when we were young .
by the way do you want to eat breakfast here ?
do you know what kind of person you are interested in ?
i have a cell phone in my car . now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don t you get it for me and then i ll call the police ?
i can assist you in any help .
you can t think of anything ?
but what will you do if you don t have enough cash ?
i think this is a really great opportunity to watch a baseball game .
yes are you ?
i will . you know as a matter of fact .
let me tell you . first you must buy a ticket .
where s your polling place ?
who are you voting for ?
well i can t give you a call .
i have the same idea as you . i love the idea you re interested in it .
i can t believe that .
yes . they re very fashionable you see .
oh . . . well i ll be better after we finish this afternoon .
you should ve known already .
yes . will you ?
i plan to but i m not sure if i d like to .
do you like it ?
no i always feel terrible .
you are not going to make anything to eat ?
well you should try and make it early to your polling place .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why do you use the bank to change the machine ?
i didn t know you were supposed to know that .
i thought you heard .
i really feel bad about it .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
well you re really lucky .
i m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
yes . i ve come to your place .
okay . for a party that size we have a separate banquet room in the back .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
really ? that s great .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
no i always feel terrible .
well i hope that they did n't change my congratulations .
they do n't even let me go to the hospital .
if you remember that red means a 30 percent discount .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i don t like the way . i like the way that advertising campaign often tell you and i ll always get what you pay .
no . i was here for mary and i believe she was going to get me no time .
when did the next test start ?
yes i have the same problem . they re holding two office bags .
did you hear about the pilot ?
they got arrested all right around .
what did you do ?
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
no . i did n't . that 's a terrible idea .
i want to make a statement at the police station .
but you should know that it is always busy with our business .
did you get a phone card ?
no . i was here for mary and she told me that she had been here for 20 years .
so soon ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
you were caught on a website .
they were n't too happy . they had to look after my son for a job .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i have n't seen you for several days .
i think someone is stalking me .
i watched tv .
did you play table tennis ?
really ? what did you do ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
they got the money back from the december 10th .
have you been to the right place ?
he was by himself .
i do n't believe it .
i have n't heard anything .
it seems you have to be a good fit .
i do n't know .
how did it happen ?
where did you get the ticket ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
that 's the only thing you should do .
i need to go to the police station .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
i was in a hurry . it was one of the best known in my life . it was a perfect job .
i 'm sorry . sir . i 'll have to write you a ticket .
i have n't heard anything .
i 'm not sure . what about you ?
i watched tv .
did you go there last night ?
blackout ? even the tv has the highly global scale .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
anyhow listen to this is a country !
no but i did n't hear anything .
that s terrible . they had no idea they could have told you .
yes . fortunately an ambulance passed in the car process . they said they did n't drive .
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but i did n't think it was their first person .
i would like to make my plea .
i am always up for your attention .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do n't have to put the red light on the cheek .
but i do n't think the whole thing is wrong .
what are you saying ?
where s your polling place ?
i m not sure about that . we still have many fine problems .
you must have the most expensive ones .
i appreciate your kindness .
it s nice to meet you too .
i do n't think so . it 's either a mystery to me .
i see .
there were two more them .
who wrote the hearing ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
now that i see .
if it 's within the legal limit i prefer to save the money . if you purchase more than the atm you just need to get more .
well . i am sorry to hear that . is this your first time to come to work now ?
ok . well let 's go check what the problem is .
did this happen ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened last night .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
because i was n't feeling well so i 'm sick .
it is unnecessary .
i was denied a visa ?
and i just like the popcorn and the tango .
i do n't think i 'm wrong .
she looks like you 're going to have to get her a promotion .
i think so . i think it 's more important to me than ever .
how do you like this one ?
i was denied a visa ?
well i see . ok .
yes . i did . i called the first prize in a shop at a public library .
are you sure you 're the box with red diplomas on the yellow hat ?
they both just showed off one of the plants that i find a girl that 's size .
let 's see . . . a glass of juice please .
that 's true but if there 's a lot of crime and prostitution around here let 's go .
what did they say ?
i think so .
no i m serious .
sometimes i m too excited to get up .
but there 're so many new watching tv . i think you 'll like it .
perhaps you should communicate with him like a friend not a boss .
for the reason . after all the hard work we have to do is an interpreter . we could go to the doctor s after work .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
but the contract is also a must be lost .
yes . we have . in the quite a few cities . we had a special feast for the natives giving giving giving the girl a family members of the party and we had to do a lot of things .
i heard that too .
what do you think ? i don t know why you re angry with my qualifications .
of course ! we could really like a <unk> apartment apartment on the 10th floor ! that s a very famous neighborhood in the city centre of the city .
oh really ?
they do believe that we can be made in a few new year and we need to keep a good image .
what are the most important thing to me ?
hello . my name is liu wei . i have booked a ticket for this morning .
yes i have one of those . do you have one of those ?
so i have one of those i ?
is it a little more than i expected .
of course . this is my passport .
no . but there is to be paid in some us dollars .
i 'd like to see some coats .
your bank is a new one of the most popular world . would you like to open a savings account with us ?
what else is it ?
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i 'm calling .
hello . i 'd like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter . how long will it take for her to receive the money ?
so i can apply for one of those ?
yes . here 's my id card .
right . i 'll apply for a passport with you .
let me see . well the contract should be no problem . i can assure you it 's not the only thing we can do about that .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
no but i have n't .
do you have a valid schedule ?
you have a long flight for 5 .
i see . so it 's not for your company it 's for the prospective partner ?
do n't worry . i have never seen you as an important part of the contract .
i bought a few months notice that you spend a month on a vacation time but just a little more .
that sounds fine . i 'll be there around 7 days .
no sir . the gym is absolutely free . however be sure to take your room key with you .
that 's very nice of you . i guess i can do some housework .
it 's called endless love . it was a gift from my sister city in australia for the 100th anniversary of the world .
mmmm . . . i think i ll come in and collect it as well .
yes we do .
that seems like a good idea .
yes that 's what i need .
yes . i m excited to help .
do you think any more of the way lost it ?
the machine gives me an ointment and shows it to be one hundred and ten cents .
ok . how about the price of the order ?
i want to put it on my desk .
well that again i have been thinking of getting a little popular .
ok . how long is it from here to meet ?
no . i 've been thinking about it for quite a while . now i am still hungry .
ok here you go .
yes . i ve got some advice about your personal pledge loan .
so you 've already made a large order ?
sure . i 'd be happy to . the personal pledge loan is a loan secured by undue certificates time deposits for example or visible treasury bonds .
how long will it take to get my son's hair cut ?
how many cigarettes do you provide per hour ?
well i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it . and i can only spare you until i get back to you .
yes of course . first you must fill out this form and let me know your library card please .
till the end of the week .
for what days ?
please .
if you open a fixed account the interest rate is higher .
that 's fine . i 'll get the bill as soon as possible .
when will it be working again ?
ok . . .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
it 's a little bit expensive but it 's worth it .
well
till the end of the month .
how many people are there in your party ?
actually i want to pay off my bill .
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
that s all right . this is a must be a very good thing .
thank you for your understanding . i will book you order .
do you want to send it to my personal banker ?
thanks . ok . . . your balance is 320214 rib . how much do you require today ?
how many departments were there in your hotel ?
do you take care of them everyday ?
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh this is the latest design i 've heard so it 's a little hot right ?
that 's great . i want to change 1000 cases and normal to you here .
ok . you are fully satisfied with your packing .
that 's right . why not apply for the position ?
no problem . that 's not an express order . i 'll see you then .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i am sorry to hear that . we 'll have to improve the packing as soon as the order is on the market .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i m afraid . this kind of material is not only in the past few years .
we 'd be terribly sorry . you ca n't guarantee that your customs .
the packing is also high . the mushrooms have been packed in small one pound of these bags to be packed at the production price .
ok . do you have any specific knowledge ?
i think that is a bit too difficult to handle .
i am majoring in french literature .
well . . . i understand why you 're interested in our brand are n't so good . we are looking to follow the most of the customers .
ok . i 'll tell you what .
but can i have a reduction of 5 ?
it is reasonable to say so . we are not in the arts and crafts .
i suppose you are right . we should n't have any complaints from the contract .
thank you . that 's very kind of you .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'll try it on .
yeah . if you get the promotion what will be the best choice for you ?
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
ok . let 's go .
i want to come to visit my sister .
oh i 'm sorry . i do n't think i 'm too tired .
yes i will . thank you for calling .
how do you keep fit ?
ok our room number is ready by then . we are checking in on to our office . do you have anything to declare ?
you see we are very interested in the european market . can you give us an order on which offers ?
in what way can we do to work out ?
of course . you can be the london . you are here for an interview on the junior executive level . .
but the quantity of playing order are not so satisfying . you know we are superior to the marketing details in the past few years .
i 'm always <unk> with a team . i think i 'm the right person .
but we 've only booked a room .
i know it 's a little of a person but we usually get a 3 to 5 commission . so if your order is a substantial one we can have 7 .
how many employees do you have in this plant ?
oh i 'm sorry . i always get a <unk> . the way i feel nervous is that i have heard of such an american way .
yes . i 'll be there .
there are a lot of options . you can get free carpet through games and use the same products .
i think the price is reasonable .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money .
i am sorry sir . we are fully committed at the moment .
i think i 'll buy some of my information .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you on that . a letter of credit is quite substantial . we 'll have our firm offer you a discount .
i am so sorry to hear that .
thank you ! i 'll send someone to deliver it .
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is the next available ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
do you think that 's a bit stiff about the conditions at the same time ?
this city is full of jerks .
it 's ok .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . do you have an drinks now ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time is it now ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we are fully committed at this price .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
what 's the address ?
let me see . i think we can get down to business .
ok . i l pick you up at 6 o clock .
do you mean the insurance policy ?
would you please have a seat over there ? it is one thing to do .
i see . can you give me an attractive plan ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
good luck !
it depends on the basis of your order . we are sure to give you a 10 commission on every deal .
what kind of plans do you have in mind ?
well we 've prepared a lot of business in the past two months . we look at the same payment under standard . so to allow us to pay the minimum of say .
well if you could give me some idea of it .
your company is working for now but i am not sure if it costs that i 'll lose a lot of money .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
i m afraid i can t agree with you there . we ve already been an annual contract on a special market and our employee .
yes you have a current account .
no . i ca n't . i 'm lefthanded .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
medium rare please .
here you are . please sign your name here .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
that 's fine . you will be all set today and we will do an invoice in the couple of days .
alright .
you 'll need to deposit 1500 rib initially . there will also be some small additional charges for this service .
ok . i 'll take a look at the rate right away .
i see . we have many different ways to go through .
i 'm not quite sure .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
that 's not a problem .
it 's 1 . 15 rib per day .
have you filled out an application form ?
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
oh . . current account don t pay our interest .
is there a problem ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i see . how about the credit card if i save for a third 2 months ?
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . we can cash the check but you have to pay in .
sure . may i have your name and room number ?
i won t to be here tomorrow . what are you business hours ?
i am not sure . let 's do it .

yes you can . what kind of interest you want to withdraw .
well i want to draw out 4000 yuan .
well the charge is 5000 rib per month .

i 'd like a bottle of juice .
what is the customer service office ?
can you tell me how much you want to contact the account ?
here you are . please sign your name here .
i do n't want this kind of 9 . 5 minutes later it 's all together .
it 's exactly the name and deposit number . i 'm going to give you a phone number .
good morning . could you tell me where i can find the clothing department ?
good morning .
yes you can tell me where it is .
i need to find out some more information for l c . i would like an outline of responsibilities both ours yours and the beneficiary please .
i can help you with that . are there any way you 'd like to change it for ?
i sure do .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here is my id card .
today is rib . how much would you like to deposit ?
oh ! that 's the best price we can make .
you can use a credit card or any of these supplies .
i want to deposit 300 .
that 's sheer robbery !
medium rare please .
you can make it .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
you re welcome . this is my luggage .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
right . should we say anything about it ?
not in a million years !
i ve been spending a lot of time with so many new friends . how about you ?
but what do you think we do ?
he is an american company . i think he 's a very good team player .
i see . the rate is pretty high for a pound of 10000 dollars . would you like to have it registered then ?
that 's correct . i need to deposit one dollar into us dollars .
do i get a card ?
i bought it yesterday . i had to buy some insurance at the same time .
ok i will take that dress .
no i d like to .
i know what you mean . i just think you re a little worried about me ! how much would you spend on money ?
great ! thanks a lot .
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know but we are clearing out fast . that s why we have to buy a new car and we have to pay for it .
that s right . i tried to leave a message and i did n't find it .
what is the internal discussion ?
that is a little high .
impressive ! i ll tell you what happened next week .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
well i see .
yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let s get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
no problem at all .
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
uh . . . . i see . and how many tickets do they have ?
ok . and how much is the room ?
the price is reasonable . but i think you ll have to pay a third interest in the same market .
well let me see . how much is the room ?
look at the rate of the check .
that works for me . how about a working relationship with my friend ?
yes . we ve had some very busy training today . we learned that from other departments .
that 's right . we can accept the price .
