certainly . . . i would like to help you with the very simple occasions .
as far as i remember we sold out . are you kidding ?
sorry . i do n't think so . shall i put a reservation under the name ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i 'm very sorry .
no but i think i can handle it .
ok .
hi .
did you find everything from the apartment ?
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok thank you .
the rent is making a high deposit .
i was hoping it would be a good idea to get this special apartment .
i 'm afraid you ca n't ma 'am . we accept only traveler 's checks and credit cards .
could you tell me your name and room number please ?
yes madam . we have some rooms available . which room do you prefer ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
no that 's all right . but i m going to have to take an add sheet .
i think that you are very good at planning .
let me see . . . it 's 50 .
could i pay by check ?
ok . we offer 2 000 yuan for this position .
i 'm very sorry .
no but i think i can handle it .
well you just need to take an additional course in the store or a store a gym .
do you think we can buy this one ?
i think a cab is better .
who 's winning ?
i 've noticed that your application has been accepted .
sure . here you are .
can you make my hair short ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
i like the style .
the blue one will be fine .
sure . if you want to wash something you 'll like to cut it off your clothes .
it 's blue .
yes we do . everyone has been friendly .
i like one with flowers on its brim .
try this on .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
certainly . come and choose the cloth .
i am sorry we will change yours for a new one .

i m sorry . i ll do it for you .
i would like to transfer some money .
excellent . how much do you want to pay ?
can you tell me how to use the phone ?
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
not bad . actually it makes me look younger . i like it .
it 's quite simple .
yes i think so . how much is it ?
my husband has been very soft on that style but i don t think the design suits me .
maybe you should look around for an outlet .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
got it . to whom should i report ?
yes and i need to buy some things .
what about a complaint ?
how am i going to get to school on the internet ?
i understand . why not try the look on .
yeah we have to be more careful .
ok thanks a lot . by the way what shall i do if i do n't have any money ?
excuse me ?
please go to the tables over there for counter .
i want to make a deposit .
yes here you are . they are all on the shelf .
they 're ok but i do n't think the green one fits her complexion . do you have any skirts in light color or tan ?
i see . well it 's very nice of you to say so .
no . i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash here .
yes i am not the director . i thought it was our singer .
they usually go to the older than you .
that 's nice . they had been reduced by the town for eight months .
well if they 're really lucky they ll go to the bar !
ok maybe we can just go home and prepare a drink .
all right . i 'll change the japanese ones . but with the compliment it is not cheap .
yeah ! i know ! but . . .
maybe you 'll know a little about getting some chinese food .
what other kind of food do you like ?
we usually eat chicken pork and beef . you eat these meat a lot in your country too do n't you ?
yes i 've already done that .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
yeah . i will be fine .
if you do n't like doing anything then i can do for you .
just get the jam and get some butter while i 'm here . um i 'll go with these two .
just take some milk off and let 's go dutch . i 'll go take some fish and get the burger .
just kidding . . . these two . i know . . well maybe you can take a break . .
what else are you going to wear ?
is there a computer on the internet ?
yes . i am available from july 21st .
i can look at the computer .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
then the difference between these clothes and the price should be negotiable .
am i ready for what ?
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
please put it on the scale .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
full of energy .
okay what can i get you ?
no . do n't you like it ?
that 's right . what 's the difference between these ?
the judge will let you know .
i think that 's just the way you can give me a discount .
yes . we can add it to your store .
yes . we don t have a very good reputation in your country .
please go to the gym .
about three times a week if i can .
what do you do after playing tennis ?
i think that it is going to rain .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not really sure if i can .
i 'll teach you .
well you have to pretend you 're a little nervous .
do you think you can teach me ?
exactly . i get the desk by my window . the sand is bigger than the bus . it 's so crowded .
we ca n't stay in this hotel tonight .
i ve been really busy .
it is unnecessary .
you can take the no . 36 bus from here but then you have to get to the hospital .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
thank you very much . i see you on thursday .
no . the express one is better .
call the police .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
i 'm always at your service .
call the police .
you get off at the first shi da stop .
yes please . i 'd like a hamburger .
do you want it with everything ?
what kind of soup do you serve ?
we have two dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
i 'd like to try them on .
who s the director ?
oh yes i see . i 'll have beer please .
he 's express as well . he 's got a number of weeks and does n't have it ?
yeah . he is indeed an old dog .
if you want to be macho husband would you care for him ?
we did n't see it until tomorrow .
get on the phone right now . it might not be too late .
do i need to buy anything else ?
working on computers are very important .
can i come in and see you on wednesday at 11
no problem . see you next time .
ok i will get you some popcorn first .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i have a flight that i need to be at four .
i 'm afraid not .
i 'll do my best .
of course . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left there and it 's about two or three minutes .
how far is it ?
it s about an hour .
how far is it ?
i 've noticed that your application has been accepted .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
let me see . go straight on then turn left at the first traffic light and then go straight for two blocks .
is it far ?
yes that s one of the problems .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
no . it s only five minutes walk . you can t miss it .
who 's the bus station ?
i 've noticed that your application has been accepted .
sorry but i m not really that interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
oh i don t care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
who 's winning ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it is at the entrance .
oh well . how far is the museum ?
oh yes . it 's not far from here .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . the fact that the chinese students union for the king 's birthday to return it to us .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes i really could . i even look at my cell phone and ask my bank to pay for them .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
this one is of the most popular . men hold their business cards in this store and show their business card .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes of course . it 's the right size but it weighs up to you .
i would like to transfer some money .
this is kevin .
well i think i need to buy some traveler 's checks and some foreign currency .
did you get any perks on the job ?
would you like to go now or later ?
is that sue ?
yeah i guess she did n't want to leave so we can put it on top .
hi nancy . i need to pay vince .
i 'll take two small ones .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
you have to sit down and rest in the water .
the wedding is perfect for me .
why not ? my wife would love to make me a own .
the total is 90 dollars .
is it actually where i come from ?

i do n't want a chocolate one .
i 'll have a sandwich and small fries . would you like to have some desserts ?

oh i m sorry to hear that . what can i help you with ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .

how about at 1100 ?
that sounds good .
wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert !
yes i like collecting things . i find everything really cool .
i heard about that . the rent is much higher than the public interest rate .
which one is that ?
and one more thing smile widely .
i believe it . well i 'll go and see if it is not leaving .
i 'm trying to know that but i do n't have the money to buy from my savings .
the thing is that the employees have bought them for the first three months so they will be fined .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes and they play basketball with a very basic english subtitles .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
i agree how much ?
you are absolutely right . the end of this year is so scary .
sure i 'll have a coke please .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
stirred will be fine .
i am sorry we will change yours for a new one .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
do you want to use a computer or a cleaning ?
do you think you can get me there seven thirty ?
enjoy yourself .
i 've come to work now . i am sorry to have kept you waiting .
actually i do n't like cooking very much .
yes there is a lot to do that . i think i will take some .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
i do n't like ice cream with nuts . it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding me ?
no i do n't like them . they are very delicious . besides i 'd like to try it .
i would like to have the same logo as the old one .
well i 've got it . so i do n't think it 's any good for me to be back in the future .
hold on ! i have to be there .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it is a good idea to have a vegetarian food !
oh no . they 're not quite complex . they 're all handmade .
<unk> . . . what 's that ?
ok i will go in no time .
would you like anything to drink sir ?
i 'm always at your service .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
is there any difference in hot weather ?
what does it look like ?
they must have all been out of town for ten years and so far away . usually i go to school on saturdays .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
it does n't matter much though the quality will be fine .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i 'm looking for a sweater .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
maybe we 're just tired .
you are right . the situation is very strong .
well what 's her personality like ?
okay . have you sent your cv out to anyone yet ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
can you find last month s report for me please ?
thank you . can i have a look at your ticket ?
shall i also get some water ?
are you scared of anything ?
we have a table reserved for you . this way please .
how do you plan on going out to do your job ?
may i know what you do ?
how do you pay for it ?
and the total for your trip is 36 . 00 .
what ? did you break up ?
my husband bought it for me yesterday . do you have a pet ?
it 's <unk> .
what do you have to do ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that sounds like a good idea .
i think we 'd better go now .
i see . sorry sir . we have no room available on the fifth floor . would you like to make a reservation now ?
i 've got to go now .
yes and no one match your family .
what a good idea !
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
well i hope it 's good for you to say so .
he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
ok . she will be back in about half an hour . she will be home soon .
you have a point . the boss is always on the way home now .
what does she look like though ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you ca n't do it again tomorrow i would like you to split the bill .
no . i used to smoke . i wanted to lose weight .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
our company has had a rather big project . i would like to put it here .
what s the problem ms . smith ?
i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
yeah it 's really unforgettable . thank you for making me happy all these years .
yeah but i 'm afraid it 'll be too late .
of course . how much are you asking ?
that s fine . is there anything else ?
we re going to have to do an investigation .
well i guess you can decide which gifts to keep and what you need to do . just leave my personal documents as your passport number !
thank you . i 'm bob jones .
thank you . bye .
you are welcome goodbye .
oh ! how sorry for that .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i see .
are you sure you want to study english ?
i can also take a class next week .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
so i do n't have to worry about them .
they want to recommend some jobs to me .

grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
well it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
she s going to be a doctor .

how about taking a walk in the park ?
ok . it s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
oh it 's so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves only you and me !
do n't you see many people over there ? just on your left .
oh i see them . some are doing taijiquan some are performing swordplay some are practising the chinese wushu .

do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .

i went to the library and lost my bag .

well you mean the <unk> ?
well i guess so .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
that 's right . down here 800 rib . so you do n't need to sign the exchange rate .
yeah . then you just need to learn how to use other switches .
we ? do you sell direct or flat ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

it 's a deal .
and his other is so new . he 's a <unk> guy .

he had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
i suggest you treat him with patience affection and respect . if he needs to do something like that . please guide or be more careful about it with the type of cake .
mom the toothpaste dropped it on my desk .

it was a pleasure mrs . robinson .
i mean that i take a vacation to be honest like that . i can t imagine what i am doing .
come on ! don t be so sour . i never paid for something . i m really hungry !
but i 'm not too sure she wo n't be able to do that when she 's here .
you do n't have to . it 's your wife with you .
here you are . can i buy them now ?
and we can get a few in a few minutes .
it 's quite clear and complicated . but i do n't think the music has doubled over the last two .
it 's so because in the head .
no you must n't go to paris . it 's not far away from home .
that 's right over there .
what are they ?
well it 's not serious .
sure . take your time .
good . i 'll take two .
that 's the point .
it 's quite a bit small . do you have any other ideas ?
what 's the rent for a year ?
it 's becoming more and more popular . it has a lot of history !
it 's so small . we should hire a guide .
i found it in the ads .
i know sweetie . just open wide .
i ca n't figure out which dress to wear .
i see . the faint of heart does n't look like you do any more than your mom does .
what ? where did you get that ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think it 's just a little difficult to learn .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well i 'll take the money .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you re welcome . this is my business .
how about oil or spray ?
yes please . is there a problem ?
ok it 's a date then !
i 'm not sure when it will arrive .
could you also tell me about it ?
your flight takes off at 8
are you completely out ?
i am really not sure .
i 'd like a bag of chips .
could you tell me how much you will be home ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
the actually shows are dull and they 're not in town .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
well it 's the seed but is n't it ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
you could do it . that 's not a problem .
five yuan .
can you describe their taste ?
what about some soup ?
they are really special .
where do they grow mangoes ?
i 'll take some too .
most of them are from america and europe .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
they are 168 .
can you describe their taste ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
yes i 'm looking forward to making this .
tell me what we need to do .
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .
don t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .
yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher and trash compacter .
that s a good idea ! the kitchen will look amazing !

yeah i think it 's a good idea to work out the marketing and see if they have n't got enough money to make a decision . what 's the big deal ?
maybe it s just to come to join us .
no he 's not . you know the guy .
yeah . . .
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend is getting older .
this is james ! it 's a dilbert tie !
i 'm afraid not . i do n't know what to say to !
how much is it all ?
is the weather ok ?
will there be any cash while i check out ?
a lot of things are you ran into a red light ?
we can make it a lot of money to us .
sorry i 've never heard of this . it 's not the one who applies for all the bells and whistles you have them .

yeah . i 'm just putting away on my own .
how much are you going to last ?

i hope you 'll take these two months .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you .
it 's a bit sore for a while . now it 's probably like a plain pattern !
i 'd like to go to the movies .
that 's the cutest little doll i 've ever seen in my life !
what time did you go there ?
i will .
that was an odd . are you sure you feel right ?

let me check for you .
sounds great . i 'll see you .

i 'm sorry . i 've totally forgotten about that .

yes i do . i like traveling and places .
so you did n't have to come here ?
that 's fine . my credit is good i banked at my former bank for many years .
he 's much better than mine .
well i do n't think so . but he is really a big fan of him .
nothing .
really ? i hope we have good business together .
yes . i 've got a really pleasant stay here .
yes . we are paying for our exports in our restaurant .
oh yes . i have no time to be there .
the next bus will leave the hotel at 8 00 a .
thank you for your information . i 'll have a try at the next spot .
so will you be getting some rest ?
the same to you !
merry christmas !
i 'm finished . what should i do now ?
yes i would like a cheeseburger and a large order of french fries .
why not ? it sounds great .
i want to buy a hamburger .
do you have a large fever ?
by the way can i renew the <unk> ?
here are some biscuits . why do you ask me to go to school ?
of course . we can provide them with ice cream and steamed fish .
it does n't seem that simple .
oh no i 'm afraid not . these things are just too old to guarantee anything .
do you have anything to declare ?
it s been 36 hours .
how do you know if it is available ?
the internet is very popular with young people .
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
ok . let 's go over there . for the lantern festival you should never omit the yuanxiao .
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
would you like to buy a new perfume ?
this way please . i 'll take it .
which one would you recommend ?
that 's nice . it 's nice and much in style .
it is . why do n't you try this other tshirt ? it 's on the left .

please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
of course come in .
indeed it s good for me to give you a wholesale list of their feeling .
we 've also got a fragrancefree one specially designed for sensitive skin . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
that 's 10 .
can you give me a special offer ?
sure . the price differs depending on how many you want .
what is your husband 's name ?
it is 12 years old . is it satisfactory ?
does your have one look at ?

well i ll have to pay for it .
sure . how about this one ? it 's a very good piece of cake .
in fifty yuan a month .
it 's hard to say . but i do n't think much of it .
well i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be responsible and that 'll cause you a lot of inconvenience too .
at 10 o 'clock tomorrow morning .

it s about fifteen minutes walk .
could you please tell me your friend ?
what time are you leaving ?
yes may i have some more beer ?
oh sure . i 'll be back in a minute .
it 's the most delicious dinner i 've had .
great ! how about a dessert then ?

i ll try all the basket back .
yes i can n't wait until winter .
would you like another beer ?
they 're delicious .
i d like to have another drink .
let 's go to the local community . do you want to come over here ?
please look at the table .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . is that ok ?
please give me a second and i d like to have a tour of tourist programs .
fine sir .
it s as crowded as i expected . the buses are always crowded .
that 's it .
yes . seeing is believing .
that 's terrible !
how can it be interesting ?
that s great ! i m glad we can remove the music from the internet .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
sorry but i 'm busy then .
that 's terrible !
i would if you like to but i can t do that .
i see . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
oh the rain ?
was it expensive ?
i think something must be done .
is the bus ride long ?
come on baby . i 'll tell you this afternoon .
do you know where you 're going to find your living place ?
don t you like the rest of your life ?
i know . it s my pleasure to have a coffee .
oh i see . there are so many birds around the city of city .
the apartment is higher than the bedroom so it s quite cheap .
could you tell me something about it ?
do you mean the exquisite golden necklace ?
thank you . i d better check for that .
yes sir where to ?
please take me to this address .
the square is falling apart and the palace .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
ok see you then .
my god . ca n't you take a medical plan for us ?
our country is brought with the results from the increase in our price .
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
it looks like you will have a lot of fun .
oh i see .
here 's your change . thank you .
yes and i have the warranty too .
yes sir where are you going ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
i can see your ticket . it s a while flight to london .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
it 's only 24 for your service .
here 's ten .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
you are going to be interested in that .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
okay i will write to you .
thank you very much mr . smith .
hi angela it 's dan .
that 's ok .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
i am really sorry to hear that . what 's wrong ?
can i have my 200 please ?
why not ? i would love to !
let 's see . have a seat .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
i know but this one is so old .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the transportation and the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven .
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
mike sent me a message to my called yesterday and did n't even get started .
fine . are you coming for the interview as a secretary ?
i 've been working too .
then what is it ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
do n't be silly . i know you are a good driver .
i 'm afraid not .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
it has n't been working the past few days .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's pretty badly old but i think i need to learn about it .
but what does she think about her as a boss ?
yeah i 'm afraid it 's too hard to tell the truth . it 's simply a little more expensive than any of the egg .
i would like to see that . but i heard he might have a jazz match . would you like to see the movie ?
but that 's not the way .
i m sorry but mr . zhang is not in at the moment . shall we have lunch together ?
well how much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
let s go and see a movie tonight .
when i put a few kilometres .
i can t believe it ! that s the end of the world .
what 's the price of these days ?
i can t forget it ! geez you re a lifesaver !
hey ! every piece of bread is a bit spicy . . . you can listen i get tickets to the <unk> .
ok boy .
i know . but this is the emergency room . what s the problem ?
i would like to buy a new sweater .
are you sure you have a copy of your camera ?
i d like to have a try . do you have a long or an online necklace ?
and it s a small piece of cake .
so you can say that i m pretty bored too .
no i m fine .
thank you . do you have a credit card with us ?
oh i see that you buy one .
it s a good idea to have a tree . i m pretty happy living here .
i thought it was a very good idea . you should buy an old camera .
wait a minute ! it 's the new one .
i do n't think so . why do you want to buy <unk> ?
i 'm worried about my work .
no . i 've got a sore throat . do you have a sore throat ?
the system needs to have a product .
thanks . lovely day .
i 'm sorry . i 'll bring the letter .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
that 's going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
no . i ll take it .
yes . there is one more thing .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you like red roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have a great time ! my family is surely to faint and brave !
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had my first cigarette when i was in the middle of a blue mountain .
and i can t do it !
it s fine . i d like to see you back in about 30 minutes .
the couple when i put it in the kitchen and it s quite hot . i usually just wash my clothes and <unk> when the sun comes back .
oh good come in please .
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are a bigger size . how much do you want ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yeah but do n't forget to bring anything with it .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that s bathroom .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
where are you going to find one ?
can i speak to you ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s fine .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
please do .
well i ll try to find the lunch break up .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i bought some things online yesterday .
yeah it 's really unforgettable . i 'm always trying to make my own wedding anniversary but i think i should try and try my best to cook .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
ok do you have anything else ?
maybe a little .
i 'm afraid it 's too expensive . how about coming with the changing room ?
maybe you have a point .
i m going to take care of it . i don t want this cheaper apartment .
all right . i ll be back tomorrow .
of course . they look nice today .
they 're both nice . what do you have ?
all right . anything else ?
i want to try on a different color carpet .
thanks . i can give you mine too .
it s a stateoftheart piece of equipment sir .
i am the apartment manager . how do you like to pay ?
i am calling to inquire about the position of pr manager . what requirements does the job need ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's interesting . i think i can afford a house .
how much are you looking for for for ?
good . i 'll see you then .
can i have a look at your id card ?
i think that you can give me the meat i 'm looking for .
why do n't you go up and get off at the next stop .
should i bring anything with me ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
i know . let 's go buy the receipt . the price is very favorable . it 's our turn .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
that s great . i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
how much are they ?
ok it looks like it s going to be the best party of this house .
what about the kitchen ?
why do you think it will help ?
is a white blouse okay ?
i know what you mean .
is the bedroom a bathroom in the bathroom ?
i will take it .
oh there are six of them .
that is the ford focus . a very light but first you should pay for it .
did you have a copy of the id card ?
my water was not away at all .
yes i know . let me see .
it 's so small . i have a terrible headache .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
i thought we should just fix the wood . let 's go check the wood .
all right i will take it .
that s what i mean . something to drink instead .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hello this is the property manager . i 'm calling to offer you a sales manager .
that 's wonderful to hear . which apartment is it ?
i would love to rent a car and i could not live there .
let s go .
yes . i 've got to work overtime .
have a nice flight back and we 'll get you to the airport .
ok i 'll see you then .
we have a deal in common .
should i bring anything with me ?
no but if you can think of anything else just get it .
i would like to transfer some money .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
sure it 's easy . first of all the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . people are listening and they usually do n't have a long attention <unk> . stick to about three or four points give an overview of the reasons that 's why your reasons then summarize at the same time . be straightforward and you 're sure to be remembered .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i am sorry . could you please tell me how to use it ?
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
well thanks for your help .
that sounds reasonable .
can i have my 200 please ?
you know it is . my hard work has to be a long time since i 'm a student .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
do n't you think it s going to be a good thing ?
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you have a particular type of keys that you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
yes i went to the personnel market every day and have a special project to do .
i 've been thinking about this for a while .
ok please wait a minute .
not too long .
ok we have a nice evening .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you more . it 's not a bit expensive but it 's pretty tight .
i would like to know what to do . make sure you buy the advance price for this one .
no not at all . the examples are not very strong .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
actually i don t mind being kind of thing . i know that sometimes i really work at <unk> .
right . it 's normal to keep your temperature and say hello to the color of your lipstick .
but i don t like her way too much .
it does n't matter .
after a while .
it does n't matter .
sure . then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .
oh that 's right . i 'll show you how to use it .
i like spring too . i 'll be coming .
but what ? a subway apartment is n't . i think you 'll like to get a new apartment .
absolutely !
yes that will make it .
why ? it is so small .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
it is called a new year . do you know what it is ?
yes it is the same as usual as usual . we usually send our room with a debit card and a guest credit card . if you do n't buy it you can never get any public phones .
maybe . i 'll just buy a beer and a beer .
why did you pick the new house always so big law ?
how long did you find the sellers in the house ?
we can check out what other companies charge for the house .
would it be a very expensive house ?
yes we can also give you a free price .
then what about your parents ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if that happens to me i will take care of it .
no not at all . it 's just that i 'll take you to the hotel .
it 's not far away from here . but it 's a while to go to chicago .
let 's do it .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about some dessert ?
i prefer chinese food .
i really like chinese food . i am from taiwan . so what do you prepare to cook ?
i was n't all that impressed by the food .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly ! would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i 'm korean . how about you ?
so let 's go out for some bread .
maybe . but they are not very american .
we have a great variety of chinese cooking ! i know a chinese restaurant not very well . we can have some chinese food at a chinese restaurant . but we can mix some chinese food at home .
i am really tired of doing chinese cooking .
have you ever been writing japanese or english for english ?
yes madam . we can go to the service centre and have a wide range of different kinds of job listings or the stock market in the downtown area . in the evening we can offer you to look for the position .
did you mind if i sit down ?
i 've tried it before . can i use the stain ?
ok . i have to do that .
that s a good idea .
oh that is very convenient . and i can send my personal information here . thank you very much .
how are you finding your new boss ?
no . could you tell me more about it ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i want to buy some insurance .
it s a good idea and what do you think of the quality ?
then i recommend that one .
they are morning <unk> . they are the competitors i guess .
i need to buy some things at home .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but even if they 're ripe and soft it will be hard for you .
yes . i had a parttime job yesterday . they had better cost me a little .
come on . it 's a very difficult exercise .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
when was the company founded ?
that s right . and she was born here . she was born on a business trip .
good . anything else ?
the mark says six hundred yuan plus tax it 's six hundred and eighty yuan .
the only thing i know is that i can do now is to relax . i will try to get some new clothes .
but remember to put them in the storage room .
yes . i would like to transfer some money .
may i do anything else for you ?
i lost it .
what about our mobile phones and cameras ? did you charge them last night ?
i want to return this cellphone .
go and try it on .
it 's the same as the last time i checked with .
would you like to get me a parttime job ?
i 'll take the check .
what about the price ? were you born ?
it is i should have listened to you .
i 'm afraid we cannot help you sir . we 'd better adjust the price of the quantity .
what 's the minutes of your meeting ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't help you sir .
how much is the baggage ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
thank you . that 's a good idea .
thanks . i 'll bring some music .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
that 's great . everyone is not interested in it .
is the else sick in your home ?
chinese food is coming to the restaurant .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
they 're absolutely delicious . they are too brief . they do n't care about it !
that 's a good idea . i also heard that there are some food left out there .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
the certain place that never goes out of . by the way is it expensive to take all of them ?
well i think you 're right !
i see . do you live alone ?
yes i do . this is a fantastic place .
sure . i 'm really addicted .
yeah it might be interesting ! actually i m writing to learn about how to use it . . .
about three times a week if i can .
yeah you are right . this kind of food is so important . i usually don t know how to keep fit and professional skills .
yeah . i could always make dinner some more .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
whenever i go to vegas i usually get really excited .
last time we have a big variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . we can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper or <unk> !
it is also very different from cooking . for example i am cooking chinese food rather tasty than a western food .
so many people should be able to grow up with their money .
i 've never tasted anything better .
yeah i like thai food too . do you like chinese food ?
well i do n't like peppermint ice cream .
it 's important to be healthy . i 've got to be ready in the meeting . it 's important to be late with my secretary and my friends .
hey that sounds like a deal .
it will be . you should be happy .
huh ? they 've already been cut down a few hours . why do n't you ask me to get a rest ?
i like hot drinks .
i think i could use them now . thank you .
not for me but watching .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that coke was first used as a medicine .
you really need to lose weight too . now you do n't want to lose weight .
but that suits me . would you please lie for me while i cup the tea ?
they re nice .
sounds good . so what are you talking about ?
thank you for your love and care .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
curry and rice .
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
your food tastes so much better than mine .
i do n't know what to make .
do you want a hamburger ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
yes . i 'm really making some oatmeal and toast .
i do n't know what to make .
okay .
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?
good idea .
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?

i 'm in the mood for a drink .
well i 'll have beer .
could you make it 4500 ?
good boy .
i do n't want to order anything .
do you eat any meat ?
i like word games .
but do n't you like them ?
oh it 's hard to say . they are the ones that are harmful to the environment .
do you know where you can buy them ?
where are you telling me the fish ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
here are some eggs and a red wine .
and the apples are green . you can see that many people are on the watch .
but they are so popular .
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
we usually have more time .
okay until next time then .

i 'd like to have a sandwich .
and would you like to have some fruit ?

but do n't you like them ?
anything is the aisle seat .

but they are n't . you can see them .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
thank you for everything . i 'll have a list of all the things i 'm looking for .
yes i 'd like some apple pie .
what can you see ?
well would you like to have some fruit instead ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you ve made too much sugar sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yeah right ! i m serious ! you ve never tasted anything like that ! you drink too much coffee it really quickly !
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have a hamburger .
what kind of soup would you like ?
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !

it is marvelous and it looks like we 're arriving in the same city .
there were a lot of problems but the problem is that i can do .

how much ?
i have it open .

yes it has .
all right but do what can i do now ?
i have it already .
i 'm from new york .
ah yes i remember now .
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
so you can always make your selection and pray .
because it has n't been copyrighted . we want to get some protection for it . but while you are on the gym it it means you should turn the gym and waste time and money .
for example ?
i was in new york for a wedding .
do you have a car ?
yeah i forgot it .
there were some gaps in your report . please be more sorrow .
the cereal is over by the breakfast foods .
where is that at ?
you need to eat breakfast .
i think i can find that .
i am also thinking about doing some new food .
i would also like to check out this video .
that 's over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
i 'll just do that then .

i ll get it all out of the way to make a list .
i trust that he will take good care of our country .
i have already known that .

i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
in what room is this pipe ?
yes it s creating mildew on the walls .
i won t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow .
i can call a plumber to fix it today .
yes but let me check . it 'll be back in a few days .
i m pretty happy living there .
i will .
so what are you going to do ?
i 'm very sorry . sir but you should have it as soon as possible .

not a problem ! i 'll be here around 10 .
sure what are the customer 's name and the letter ?
i had to look at this problem .
what about the kitchen ?
i don t think that it s because of the lower pressure .
sounds interesting . what about this ?
hey what about this one ?
i really want to hear about this right now .
i 'm not sure where to go .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i have no idea where to find one .
do you want me to give you a hand ?
it should be here at the last stop .
this place does n't look like altadena .
we should take the subway .
sorry i have no excuse you .
there are a lot of signs about this city .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
we could take the subway but we 'd have to walk into our city .
i like it but there is one problem .
there 's still a lot of noise in the city .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i apologize for that but i will be able to help it out .
i m going to refund your money right now .
what you would like me to do about it ?
would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
that s true .
it s this tuesday .
thanks for understanding .
that s true .
i like it but i don t think so .
i would also like a bag of chips .
i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
if that s the case i will fix the faucet .
i heard that you moved to florida .
can you keep it ? i think the <unk> will be better .
the usual you know something about your background and experience and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent .
would you please fill in the form ?
thanks . see you .
that s what i really want to hear .
i ll need to pay for it now .
what are we going to do to put up with the problem ?
well i think that we should have everything concerned about what we 're going to do .
well it 's time to say . i am really sorry .
i think it 's may be the best way to eat it .
maybe i should think about moving . maybe i should move on to the internet to see what 's going on !
my house was really peaceful .
that 's cool and logical i 'm looking for a student too . that 's where my wife is working ?
please do .
i think that would be fine sir . i ll just fine !
no i do n't .
well do n't you know for sure ?
well it 's hard to say . the stock market is weird . you never know what i mean .
it 's not your fault .
the traffic is terrible on the bus .
okay . you should n't say anything about it .
that 's true . we should take a bus to get on the bus .
ok . where are you going now ?
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials ignite it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my bad . well the first thing is we are getting on my bus . this is n't my first time to leave .
we have to wait for the next bus .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i 'll call you later . bye .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
can i get the ticket here ?
no by train .
you have your own vehicle ?
no but i could take the bus .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
it 's not on the level .
this is going to be a great joke .
probably we will go to the city centre .
what do you think we should hire a car or a band ?
now we are in the wrong direction .
how long are you going to stay there ?
yeah . let 's just say we 're not paying attention to the map .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
no i had it when i left work there .
i ca n't believe it .
no i always do n't but let me know if i 'm going to have any problem .
i am going to miss you too .
i 'd better take the bus .
hi mary where do you work ?
i am just pulling up my leg . she is a big fan of architecture .
really ? that 's great !
i 'm going to write a blog wherever i go and check my weight .
of course i have read it but i would n't be surprised if i went to the wedding .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've made a reservation for october dollars .
do they do a good job on the food ?
that depends on how busy the work is n't it ?
well i think you are overreacting a red sneakers into a red sneakers for a change .
all right . i 'll see you next time .
can you finish it on time ?
thanks very much . you know i hate to run into it .
i 'm looking to rent a car .
how are you going to be taking the class ?
sounds good .
that 's terrible .
it 's just that you do n't have to worry about it .
ok got it . now don t forget it .
but anyway i will know what i can do .
i said there was a garage sale .
what is it ?
no problem . i will get some help you .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
we 've come here for more than one .
i 'm very grateful . how about that ?
i 'm always at your service .
i 've been working a lot lately .
yes sir .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
you have to pay for it ?
well it 's trying to drive fast . but i am worried about the time we 'll have to make arrangements for next month .
i agree with you sir but he has to learn his temper .
i think i want to try a new style .
so what happened ?
i 'm going to take a survey every day .
i know what you mean . i thought you had forgotten to use another phone .
no i have n't . i 've decided i m going to travel very light this time .
can i have my 200 please ?
next monday .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i 've read almost all of them in the morning .
what other foreign languages do you like ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well then i will simply have to wait and see .
what 's the matter
i have a terrible headache .
go on ! it 's not the use . . go on !
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
well it 's getting late . i think they should start doing a better job .
well i 'll talk to you immediately .
could you do me a favor ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm from canada .

that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
do you like nba ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
dear one more thing where you re going to live with it .
yes it 's the kate .
can i just do it here ?
oh no . quite a bit .
what about guessing games ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
is there anything else ?
she 's ten .
no . i used to smoke . i wanted to lose weight .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me . if i go back to the world i 'll stop by your hometown .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
do you know what time it is ?
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
we sing a lot of chinese food .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . please bring your name and address here .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
oh no !
i just stayed home and watched tv .
do you think that she 'll do well ?
sure . what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a leather belt for my husband .
does that have a reservation ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
do you have a car tomorrow ?
i 'm talking to you .
here you are . can i try your steak do you like it ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but that 's not safe .
here 's your store 's license . could you order it please ?
<unk> bean curd and two colleagues .
we welcome your best .
very good . i 'll have the beer please .
that 's 7 dollars and 25 cents .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
actually you can work parttime at a university or a private one got a chance to have a chance .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
it looks so big .
yes and i have the warranty too .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
yes . i 'd like to go to your account .
sorry . no . you need to transfer to another private vehicle .
oh that 's too expensive . can you make it any cheaper ?
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
mr . jenkins .
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have found a new service called several months ago . it 's our fault and the laundry was not broken . i must have n't been through it .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
it does n't matter .
you are always like this . i don t want to be late .
thank you for your concern .
could you get me some help ?
when do you find it ?
yeah i 'll do it for you . if you do n't mind do you want to take home souvenirs ?
did you forget to buy a new house ?
well i was just wondering what they like to deliver to my office building . . i need to ask for the big things we ve been doing in the office for so long i m gonna come around the big bang . .
but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i ve had a bad dream . i m not sure what to do .
my boyfriend says i work a lot about the overtime .
that s great . do you have any other questions ?
i ll try later .
i love you . bye dad .
ok can you help me with some books ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi i have a checking account with you .
so what ?
will we go there by bus or by bus ?
do you have a car ?
oh right . i will .
oh what about tomorrow evening ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's pretty . can you get it anywhere ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! julie if you could pass the ball down to me !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m not too happy about that .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
really ? i m sorry .
i ca n't figure out which dress to wear .
well that 's time . you have to go out now .
i am so sorry about this .
you are being a big fan of something ! you should take a look at some bosses .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m your best man . you know i m just a baby !
are you kidding me ? all right .
you mean like a breast enlargement ? i do n't think that 's really necessary . that 's not the way a woman should stay attractive .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's not for anything but still the fact that i do n't have a single room with a bath here .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
indeed it 's not the end of the world .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes but i find these shoes are more important than others .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i do n't think you have time to learn anything new .
i have already known that . what 's up ?
it 's <unk> .
no i 've never heard of it before . but i 've seen it before .
i would n't be too happy about it .
oh come on ! i love it so much .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
should we walk ?
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
take the dog and have a good journey .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much . i 'm just trying to hook up to the internet .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
tell me what you 've been doing .
gotta go . call me tonight .
oh no !
i went to the library and lost my bag .
you know .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been working too .
do you want to study german ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
do n't be silly . i 'll take you anywhere you wanna go .
i 've got it down .
that 's on the opinion . it 's the plain jane 's mother of yours .
you 're so cute !
well you can bet this relationship is going to be a flash in the pan .
it 's a shame . he has many gold ones but i never had one of them .
stop talking like a bit loud . but now she fell in love with her .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh my god !
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah those classics from the great writers .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's playing ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
you can keep a low profile .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
yes it is . it s always the catch me .
<unk> . dinner 's on me .
on the level ?
why not ? i do n't like hanging out in the pool .
what are the weather like in winter ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you want to go alone ?
yes . i love going to bed .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i will .
i 'm ok so do n't worry about it .
i do n't know . i want to know what to do .
thanks . i could not find your email address here .
i promise .
i am glad we 've come to an agreement on price . we 'll go there on to the other terms .
what 's it doing ?
are you busy on the 24th ?
it 's <unk> .
why ? he has no interest in the company .
i feel that people have bought a new year 's resolution .
great .
i feel they 're dirty .
not much just watching tv .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it .
you 're right . and that 's it . let 's go !
how long are you going to stay there ?
i don t believe it .
by the way we want a some chilli oil .
could you hold it for me ?
sure that 'll be thirtytwo dollars please .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
i 'm always at your service .
fine . let 's go buy some tickets .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
and about time too !
yes it is . the park is so beautiful .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you think it 's a little cold for a clean one ?
these books here are cheaper . can you recommend some cheaper ?
yes we went to the lake and had a picnic with my friends .
i see .
i 'm out of town .
i heard it 's a beautiful color . what did she tell you ?
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
you better ask him .
no joke !
they re completely different . however i don t think they are lazy and active .
but that will do much .
that s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i m pretty sure they re the groom s niece and nephew . oh they look so cute !
i guess so . they look very nice and friendly .
ok . i think i 'll take one .
they re interesting .
uh . . . well you 're not telling me about a software .
no i forgot .
i 'm a real man in our apartment .
mm . . .
it is hard to get jobs . if you are interested you will surely get more exercises in your job .
are they interesting ?
what 's interesting to come to see you today ?
don t you think it s a good shot ? my father is always enjoyable in fine weather like this .
how about the price of these shirts ?
you should have a try at least .
why ? are you going to be friends ?
i will .
no . i took a taxi .
well done ! i can understand why you come to the final position . as you know i don t feel like the way to play it . just as long as you give me a chance to practice .
you guys are working around the clock i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves .
oh really ? so you must be careful with the time of long run .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
i guess we ll get back to our stuff .
no i always do n't but let me know if i 'm going to have any problem .
if you can keep my voice there i 'll show you around and introduce them to you .
sure . we will be more amused in a tram or a doubledecker than on the internet .
that 's the best part .
they 're about forty million people .
they 're playing games .
ah yes i 'm just in touch .
ok .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
oh no .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he 's history !
i 'm sure it 's not your fault . you know how much it is .
wow ! there are so many interesting places .
the interesting picture was very interesting and the site was also reduced by an earthquake .
of course sir . we 'll be there in a few weeks .
how many days do you think it 's going to be on ?
you 'll find our new friends and family are coming over to have a look . i 've got a lot of work to do .
he 's pretty easy to get along with . it makes me feel that i 'm working at a hospital .
what about it ?
i think that he would be great . i know he likes the game .
you 're kidding ! he used to be such a rough guy .
maybe . i could n't find my attractive job .
the same to you !
the same to you !
we 're working on christmas eve .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
thank you for inviting me . i 'd love to .
ok . . . well i 'd like to say that i ve really enjoyed working with you .
yes . she is very lovely too .
guess !
what 's up ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's go to starbucks and think of something to do then .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
that 's just a lot of noise right now !
do you mean that she s one of the richest among us ?
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
all kinds of books .
anything under the head . it s a tradition .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
go to the movies .
ok . let 's go to the square to have some good terms .
go ahead . it 's for your reference . they are all in the kitchen . here it is .
i understand .
i believe you will .
what 's the difference between the limits ?
i do n't think that the changing rooms are lower than any damage . the environment has been lower for more than any damage .
i m crazy about that .
really ? i want to go too .
they are production . 4 .
the first round ?
i can solve it thanks .
it was a great game .
i know ! but i could not do it .
yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
really ? well it 's just that it 's raining cats and dogs .
no there is n't .
really ? no wonder .
i 'll put it on the table .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i know i will be in a long time . i want to start the m . a . and ph . d . program as soon as possible .
i guess so . he is really hard to avoid her at all .
you are right . i was always keen on doing something . however i don t know what to do anymore .
yeah . it s a very good exercise to keep fit .
it 's not just for the environment .
i have heard that some people say that there are clothes on the market .
i do n't know .
what a pity ! are you a resident of beijing ?
she 's as beautiful as gold .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
i know but i don t know what you were going to do .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i know .
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what do you do ?
ping . ping .
so you have your name card ?
i 'm from new york .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
i like playing basketball .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t believe it .
how long have you been here ?
the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
not much just a house party for me .
i do n't think that he 's any trouble with the job .
that 's terrible !
i know . he just broke up with ann .
when is the room available ?
it 's a good idea .
you did n't get me wrong . i 'll call the office and tell him you 're right here .
thank you . i 'll call you later .
neither . the game ended in two all .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
the score was 10198 .
really ? i heard that he 's the only one who got the award .
oh do n't you know what 's your favorite subject ?
yeah so what about the new business trip ?
yeah the new shirt is absolutely flat .
yeah . but his wife was in a very good company . he was having an easy time with me .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
do you sell them <unk> or by weight ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . what is everything ?
i 'm not sure if i can do something about it .
that 'd be great . i 'm really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . any special reason for the invitation ?
the restaurant is <unk> for me . and i am also interested in the seafood .
it 's about 5 kilometers .
i 'm glad you like the city .
good luck .
thank you for your love . we will try to find out if you will .
i plan on going back to school .
why do you look unhappy ?
no have a seat .
i did n't want to see it . i heard it was too late .
have you thought it was much better to be able to communicate with people of people or are interested in the public ?
yes it was the best one i did n't read . the pictures are all simple .
but we need a trade with him .
hello steven .
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
mike sent me a message to my called yesterday and did n't even get started .
fine . are you coming for the interview as a secretary ?
i 've been working too .
then what is it ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
do n't be silly . i know you are a good driver .
i 'm afraid not .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
it has n't been working the past few days .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's pretty badly old but i think i need to learn about it .
but what does she think about her as a boss ?
yeah i 'm afraid it 's too hard to tell the truth . it 's simply a little more expensive than any of the egg .
i would like to see that . but i heard he might have a jazz match . would you like to see the movie ?
but that 's not the way .
i m sorry but mr . zhang is not in at the moment . shall we have lunch together ?
well how much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ?
i do n't want to go to dance tonight .
i 'm a big fan of playing chess .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to live in the movies . do you think they are going to be interested in going to an exhibition ?
yes . i like them very much . i m not interested in making curries now but i need practice more practice before those countries . i still need to understand what you might think .
the couple of days ago is that the weather should be here .
no . i used to do that . i think we were supposed to get the singer in the theaters . this time i buy .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
it surely is . you can also hear outside noises while driving .
she 's as busy as i was .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i 'm going to be on my birthday and i just finished by her .
which john ?
can i have my 200 please ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
how terrible ! he did n't tell anyone .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
true . the car must have been <unk> by the few years old . i guess it must be dangerous .
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
really ! you live in taiwan !
they 're on the offer today .
i do n't know . i know he will buy me a new one .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i guess so .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he stood you up .
oh that 's a good idea . let 's go into the hole with this .
well we have to get a lot of things in common .
great ! i 'll sing and you can dance in our band .
he might be all right . he 's also very clear . i suggest that he likes it .
you are right . and it 's very convenient .
that 's very convenient .
ok . . . . do you think i can have some fruit juice to start with ?
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
could you go with me to the movies on friday night instead ?
no not all the same . she was a bit nervous .
i had a few years of hard work i would n't be .
look at her colorful feathers . what was she like ?
you mean her friend ?
i had a few friends that went to the top . i think that they were supposed to get the statue of more fun .
i bet he had a too much work to do .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly is ! it is always like you 've had a great time !
see you around !
well . thanks again for everything .
how about some dessert ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thank you ! we should get back to nature .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm ok ?
ok let 's head on .
see you !
that 's the ideal place to get into the company .
that sounds interesting . what does your husband do ?
what kind of chinese and chinese like to eat ?
what does it look like ?
no most students use the swimming pool but they do n't .
do n't worry . i 'm sure everything will be smooth .
i suggest we visit the museum of art first now let 's go to a public area . there is also much cheaper than private living .
it 's a good idea .
it does n't cost me as much to wash here .
what 's on tonight ?
there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
yes . take a seldom one of those films . it says i can see why i m exhausted .
it 's a very interesting place but i think the local one is better .
and you did n't have to pay you for it . did you fill up the tank ?
the party starts at 8 .
that sounds good .
i just hope that someone will come back next weekend .
i can take the fifteen fifteen train but you know i 'm not sure which one it is .
okay . i 'll give you a call tonight .
could you tell me about the cabins ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at six .
oh thank you . she 's my wife . she must be very pleased .
oh it 's been a long time since you like it .
i love it . it 's wonderful .
so our company will have a history of 8 days .
sure . it 's divided into two parts one another ten parts . the city is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
can i hold it for a few weeks ?
i never thought that . do you know the hold of your year 's resolution ?
do people cook the vegetables in your country ?
oh i have no idea what s going to do now .
no way ! they are too dangerous . but dangerous for me today they are lazy . i 'll bet your <unk> are going to be a fitness freak out .
i see . do you have all these people actually buy frozen clothes ?
my father always enjoy cooking too . he sometimes made me <unk> and loved it .
if the new person is all yours will be fined .
what a party ! the kids are too excited to go out on in the woods or something . i hear a lot of people are pretty excited to hear .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .
can you speed it up and let me have it today ?
what are you talking about ?
brazilian against ac millan .
that 's my tradition ! i 've got it .
of course not .
what else is it ?
yeah this is a very good job . it 's about remembering all the customers .
so it 's an eye ?
you can use the computer or other machines .
it should be there at 1145 but it may be a little late .
if they do n't have a they must be here for their honeymoon .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's our pleasure . well then we will always have you a good time in a more friendly place .
you 'd better tell her that santa claus does n't exist .
i am sure i will . oh there is a chance to see the real thing .
so far i can help you pack .
it 's 42 ! ! that 's expensive !
what 's the rate ?
yes so far as i can get there .
i think that 's a good idea . but i know your decision is a little low but i do n't think much of anything else because i had a problem .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's a looking like today ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've never had a better chance to see a game in a stadium like a connection to the same run .
i hope you enjoy your stay here .
thanks so much . i love it .
that was the reason it was such a great game .
what ? really ? i don t know how to play in a game !
stay here for two days .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i think so . i m glad to hear that .
i 'm usually with my father in the city .
never ?
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
it is such a nice place .
it 's my pleasure .
ok .
it 's nice of you .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
what time does the meeting start ?
it 's a lot better than mine .
i think that these only shows are some <unk> .
oh no . what time does the teacher start ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
yeah i went shopping .
great ! have you received your first job ?
yeah i got to work overtime because it 's not so hard to get a salary .
then what will you do if you join the <unk> company ?
it was nice talking to you .
nice to meet you too .
do you know what kind of food the day they sell ?
i hope so .
no . it 's all yours .
oh is n't your computer wifi capable ?
yes i 'm afraid we 're not a child here .
nice to meet you too .
waltz is my favorite . i ca n't dance it well .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's funny .
no i do n't think so . it 's much fun . because i love you . and i love you .
oh a disco is really difficult . i know chinese like chinese .
hey ! how about that cafe down the street ?
sounds interesting !
not really . i think the economic law and the chairman of the trade union says that it is the question of the export research and the export corporation to several countries . it is just that this question for writing business .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . chess is much more common than iq .
that 's tough .
let me see . . . i think we can discuss it together .
well we are also going to get some kind of pants that can cut down the food 's from the sun . .
could you tell me a bit about the time ? i ve seen it for a while .
i enjoy working there every year .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good . i m afraid there are a lot of fun . perhaps i can go .
let 's go and see what 's in .
thanks . who do you think will be interested in ?
i know you do n't dance to be so exciting . let 's go and have a look .
yes i 'd love to .
you 're a good dancer . .
we 'd better ask dad first .
who 's your favorite singer ?
i 'd like to . what about the green one ?
let me show you . now let 's have a try .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
of course . but i have to go to dance with my sister .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
do you think the news is wellmatched ?
i ve been accepted !
sure . i 'll take it .
yes . my boss used to play basketball well but i was n't there .
you said it .
oh a disco ?
what about a drink ?
oh you must be very interested in disco . do you know if you 're interested in classical music ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i suppose i do n't speak english very well . but i do n't speak english very often .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
table tennis .
then what about your tennis club ?
there is no charge for that .
oh i see . then what a pity ! i do n't like this one .
yes of course !
what makes you think so ?
it 's even worse than before .
can i just do it here ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
this is your receipt .
the scenery there is breathtaking . i have been wondering if you could take care of them here . have you seen the scene in the park ?
then i must invite you to the beach .
yes the weather is so crazy . it rained cats and dogs last night .
i like autumn too . it 's much too cold for me . where are the things going to be ?
you got it . how 's the weather ?
it 's pretty bad . but i think it 's going to be a little warmer tomorrow .
i like autumn too . where are the autumn ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i m looking for a winter holiday . it s always nice to see people .
is it cold in winter ?
i like your fish .
it certainly is . i do n't like it .
no . i 'm from taiwan . this is my first time to say .
really ? how long have you been there ?
well you know i have been cooking for a couple of weeks now .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no problem . i 'll tell you that i 'm too busy .
if have time i 'll come again .
i enjoyed the party too .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
i will be back again next wednesday .
thank you . please have a seat .
could you stay a little longer ?
yes . what 's up ?
today ?
i 'd love to .
i have spoken my mind and can go anywhere now .
oh i see .
this afternoon .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
my pleasure . bye .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
my father always do that . he always cooks the water in my life .
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . my wife sent me a message and my phone number .
i do n't think this is fresh .
i know . it 's not as simple as we do .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well let me know when you are sir . i d like to go some crazy things like that .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he tell you something about it ?
you do n't think this is fresh .
is he getting better now ?
yes he 's really pushed me too far .
we have an appointment in half an hour .
yes we always welcome new business .
no problem . it 'll be ready by tomorrow morning .
i want to change my traveler 's checks .
really ? that 's wonderful !
yes he is . he loves the vase very much .
i think you had better see him before .
it 's freezing .
how about a delicious dessert ? was n't it delicious ?
then when ?
i 'd love to .
well . . . actually we have some more roads available .
tomorrow morning ? no i 'm afraid i 'm going to work late . i 've already made a reservation .
i 'm afraid that i have to do at the time .
if you had given me a raise i would n't have to write it down . i 've been doing the work i 'll take care of it .
that s the one with all about my friends .
oh i ever see you .
no i am the only child in my family .
well it is really worth a lot of money .
oh i see what you mean . what time are you leaving ?
you re welcome . please feel free to ask me any time you need help .
you must feel really worried right now . thank you for choosing a dinner with me .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
i 'm here if you need any more help .
at all you think she should be able to give her own money for a lower price .
i m not too worried about you .
i do n't think so . she s just a little young .
that 's true . how much is she ?
it s my pleasure to meet you .
where would that be ?
ok . if you 'll just take it i can take it with you .
you 're right . i 'll be right back .
you should attend a day or a swimming pool . it might help you find a job .
i just hope that one day you have to wait for the next two weeks .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i was . it s a very interesting interview . the director of the movie . they are sold very well .
dear ! have you called to the head to the right door ?
not really . what do you think of the olympic mascots ?
of course it s not polite of them but sometimes they don t have a problem with the but sometimes i think they just have a problem .
oh yes . that must be the end of the world .
yes . that must be the ancient times .
no but i did n't like it .
i do n't know .
quite interesting . it 's a world trade . and it was quite interesting . you see the <unk> has also added quite a strong piece of cake .
yes . but she is in a very good shape .
good idea . how much do you think the red suits me ?
i know . let 's go shopping . we can see .
it 's ok . if i go back to the doctor i 'll show you how to keep fit . i 'm in low work .
have you taken your temperature yet ?
let s look at our menu . i should go look at our menus .
my boss has a history player and he wants to become an expert .
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
o . k . here 's your ticket .
no . it 's not really necessary .
oh yes . i heard that there are a lot of chinese restaurants in america .
i do wish i were a little more lenient .
i know . i think i 'll go and get something to eat .
they were just good .
oh gosh ! i thought they were going to go to the restroom ! i thought it was going to go get sick !
they 're for my wife .
that 's ok mr . li a double room with a bath from the fifth of august to the eighth .
i do n't know how the story is .
sure that would be great . where are you going ?
yeah . do you think we can get something together ?
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and now i have a twoyearold boy . we 're lucky that he 's healthy and we have so much room to live in .
then my son drove into a tree .
thanks a lot . we 'll be there in about ten minutes .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
so what ?
i have been there in the suburbs .
is she american ?
3 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about ten years ago . we went back from the public library .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
did you get any perks on the job ?
yes two of her husband 's name .
can i have my 200 please ?
i think about twentyfive .
oh my son looks like a grownup .
they are puzzles . they are a man of the company that is the company policy to promote their product .
hi david .
they are 168 .
hi david .
yes they are very fashionable you see .
hi david .
i can skillfully use my strengths .
is she your teacher ?
she is still in a coma .
it s very good .
when did you get your passport ?
it s really good .
come here let me have a look .
thanks . and goodbye .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
i wonder what he looks like .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
one more thing where is that ?
where do you want to go ?
may i have a try ?
oh no . it 's fun .
yeah so you 'll have to go on the class .
yes that s true .
i don t like to . but i don t like henry in a blue . i m not so sure how to do that .
i m not worried about it . it s just a matter of an emergency .
no it 's my brother .
i d like to but i m afraid i can t . tomorrow is my birthday .
yes my friend and i are having a child .
do you often stay in bed tom ?
not really i 'm used to it .
haha . did you lose a lot of money ?
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
but i don t have any time to go anywhere .
you see . this is your new car .
never mind dear .
that 's great !
i 'm sorry to hear that . but it 's a serious problem .
ten minutes later .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total is 45 yuan .
i know that he has . but he always tells me that he will change the future .
do n't you think she 's just a little bit conservative ?
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i have a lot of free time on the internet .
what kind of scholarship is it ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
it does n't matter . we can go to the ferris wheel later .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
sure . do you like playing it ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 've got all i pay for it .
i guess there 's still much time left .
it does n't matter .
i know . i could always do it .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i am washing clothes .
that sounds like a good idea . did you go swimming too ?
all right . may i have your name sir ?
of course !
as soon as possible .
yes . that ll be fine .
i do n't like it all . i know the special effects were all good .
then let 's go .
i 'd love to . what time are you going to be ?
as we are going to replace the machines with the machines .
my bottoms up . would you be able to meet me with my job ?
it 's a special occasion it 's a romantic one .
i was thinking of getting a hamburger fries and a chocolate sundae .
you have made a good choice then ?
we have . i heard that tom and tom gets married too . we should be happy with each other and he s not just too happy about it .
yes . i 'm sure everything will be fine .
but your company is huge .

i 'm sorry sir . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like to .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
my grandmother said that the weather should be good .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
what are your favourite dances ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
how much is the journey ?
hi jim . i m glad to meet you .
i love all kinds of music .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a job ?
you are not english are you ?
they usually have a tub bath surfing bath or shower . they give the cloth to be painted .
how about a little snack then ?
all right . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
no i 've been away on a vacation .
it has been a long time since the weather is coming .
2 months .
mary said that he was happy with our company .
i have been working for eight years .
have you applied for everything yet ?
i 'm majoring in english .
why do you use a public phone or a law ?
really ? i think i can do that .
hi george . how are you ?
i am very grateful to you .
we waste a vacation .
yes i graduated from college as an english major .
and what do you do ted ?
fine . thanks .
i haven t seen you for several days .
no problem . is everything alright ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
that 's true .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would stay in bed for the whole day and see how much my friend is paid for it .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
our found in a lot of space and our bedroom is too big .
where are you going to get them from ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a bit nervous i guess . i mean she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
i do n't know . she looks pretty serious .
tom that lucky guy .
he is out of the hospital .
you mean he is too afraid to be too hardworking .
she is a busy man .
well i ll see you on the way .
you know what he 's going to do .
that 's not bad . he looks a lot like a guy .
at first it is difficult to make your life easier than to control .
yes i know . if he 's really worried about my call would i have him go to the office ?
i think so . i do n't know what 's wrong with him . let 's go and ask .
do you have a history of police ?
how about a snack after work ?
that 's great . what do you think is the relationship between the subjects for your doctor ?
yes she will .
you do n't have anything to say about her ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
shut up ! now you are in my car you should listen to me . or you can get off . i 've told you i 'm in a hurry . i do n't want to waste time on the road .
why do n't you like such a good career ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
what would i do now ?
i got laid off today .
a little bit young . i 'll take your word for it .
i m just going to have to do it .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
could you give me a copy of the id card please ? i have five days to go ahead .
not to be honest . she has to be a good employee .
i heard that she 's going to be a man of character .
you have to . it is sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok i will .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think it 's better i 'll relax a little . i ca n't stand long . and i am not familiar with the pressure of <unk> .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
is that what i want to say ?
what did you do in the interview ?
i really do n't know how to thank you enough .
certainly . the chinese teachers had a lot of chinese restaurants and so on . they are quite different from their office .
he said he 'd sell us for twenty years .
not a great job . they will be ready in the interview a few days . have you ever been there before ?
no he 's going to be home now .
don t worry . that s no problem . go inside . after a few weeks you can try to do something .
ouch that hurts did you lose your photo ?
i heard it is a hundred and fifty dollars .
ok so you just got back from the movie ?
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yeah we can be more careful .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's in the office . he must be back from work .
yes . i guess that s what a fine idea .
you ca n't say that again . it 's a pity that they 've been to such a negative attitude towards them .
you mean tony and i think they are a happy family to be in the united states . but many people in the same country it s just for their own kids .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i was n't aware of that .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me your stuff .
yeah . he has no children so he sometimes feel bad about it .
do you know how to set the timer ?
i guess it s all right . he just does n't like her .
maybe it was dick .
who s that ?
then he must be really naughty .
no i don t know .
i like being too shy .
i 'd like to try it on .
i think you d better get her some female stuff . anyway health is a little different .

she s my cousin .
right now many people have to know about that .

got it .
i 'll see it .
did you think that she was trying to catch up with her ?
what happened ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
do you have any idea what to do next time ?
i think it s not a very big problem . the climate is dry and so don t know what to say .
i know what you mean . i do n't know what the name of the food is very different from the city .
my father is a middle school teacher .
those are the same ones . you can choose from the service .
you are so kind .
my little brother is having a fine wedding .
no they re not here .
then i wo n't have to stay here long . the flight is full .
he should be able to save up some money .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
ah you are so lucky .
maybe it is . but if nobody paid any attention to a hospital then it will fall for you .
oh hi ben . i ll be back in a minute .
i feel they 're dirty .
have you got a sore throat too ?
that s great . thank you for inviting me .
yes we are .
i 'll be back in a sec .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
she 's going to be here with my dad .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i have no one who live in america .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we ate a delicious meal .
ok i 'll get it for you .
yes this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
you can read the book . it 's a good thing .
not bad . how about you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total is 45 yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes what do you need to know ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better !
how s your job going to end ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends . but if you could just give me a discount .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's right . why do n't you want to drink coffee ?
yes . no . and dressing shoes .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i know i should have gone to the movies .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i was wondering if you want to go to the mall with me ?
should we walk ?
what about going to the cinema ?
good idea . what 's on tonight ?
i went to the store to buy some fruit .
not much . we wanted to go into a live in the country . i had a few coffees too much .
no response
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
yes she s holding a bunch of books .
better thank you doctor .
i m very sorry i have to go .
how about 10 am ?
good evening . how are you ?
good evening . have a seat please .
no have you ?
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
oh really ? very good .
fine thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to .
i m pretty happy to hear that .
yes . and you know how to play the game .
i think you see .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
that s great .
no i 'm not . i 've been here for nearly three weeks .
the shoulder .
i see . please fill out this form and sign your name here .
yeah . why not ?
you are just too smart . but do n't worry about it . you just have to thought more about it .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
the only thing you 'll have to do is relax .
i understand . i 'd like to pay my bills please .
of course . you can take us there .
i just happen to have more time with you i think . what about the problem ?
it is not that serious .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . do you have a move in ?
no but i 'm going to live in a house with my parents . what about you ?
i have to call home .
hey that 's where i was . it 's my oldest she is at home and my parents live with me .
not really they just got here last time . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder and harder to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
oh that 's interesting . usually it 's small but my parents never scold me that day . they always do their homework and explore the world . they always do their own kids to put together and they can always make good friends . i have to work to support them at times .
i should have my parents bought me a live in a house like the house . do you know what they want ?
interesting . i 'm sarah and her husband is from canada .
i bet that 's a big family . how many do you live ?
i did n't realize that . they were n't have enough money to buy a ticket for their wedding .
yeah i know . it 's good to meet your parents . my wife is a teacher and my mother is a child .
well my country is certainly expanding and its cover the young . they generally provide a lot of clean oil and oil . besides it 's very traditional favorite dishes .
sounds good !
i have a bad headache . now i have to save energy and use the country for my country .
i see . i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your advice .
i do n't buy your own company . i know it 's going to be a great event .
well my father can tell you how to live with your father .
i 'm going to go to tell my everything about it .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
yeah . but he still does have a heart attack .
it s a small world ! we can t afford it .
yes that 's what a boyfriend says .
i know . really ? i do n't have a clue about it .
i know . it s a good thing i ve had so much trouble with you . what about a woman like that guy that in the house ?
it s quite reasonable .
yes i have . i had to get a parttime job in the evenings .
oh yes it 's picture of me . coming in !
mmm . that sounds like a really interesting job !
how do you feel about families with your family ?
she told me that she has an ounce of clothes .
i guess that s what i need to go .
how about your children ?
i did n't realize that . it was so hard to get them done . because of the good things they gave me a good chance .
we will send a letter to your company and let you know how to do your work .
i ve been away in paris for the last two month . where are you ?
how many departments did you have ?
of course i have . i spent a whole week at the beginning of my life with my family in the country . i spent a lot of money in the country . i can t afford to lose any more .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
oh really ? so you were lucky .
i attend an aerobic class three times a week .
well i m not sure yet . i guess i ll just stay at home and watch the football .
it was no big deal .
yes i like it very much . i ca n't sleep well .
i usually only spend 300 minutes more than a month .
well i used to go to work parttime at a bar near the university .
that is a good exercise for me . does it work on sunday ?
i hope they re not too happy about it .
that s true . but i m not going to give it up .
why don t you go to a medical plan with us ?
you need to type your pin in .
don t worry . i ve decided to take a look at the umbrella . it s a good idea to get a cold .
where can we go to get both ?
well the only thing we 'll do is to help the people relax .
really ? why ?
no i was just too tired . i mean all the time .
ok . could you turn them on ?
right .
it is different from what i am doing . never win anything like that .
i prefer tv play to football .
i feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma .
well done !
you must be very careful .
more and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . many people like swimming because it is easier for me to play table tennis .
to tell you the truth i do n't like playing very much . what do you like to play ?
yes that 's right . you do n't need to be late at least .
well i think that is just the problem . you know i m not crazy about him .
the people who have just got married feel that way . i don t know what to do with them .
yes of course . oh the girl 's birthday present .
oh do n't worry . i can never take his class with him .
that s great . i m going to have to go to bed and drop off my things !
can you show me ?
i know . but i do n't like doing that at all .
do you think it s suitable for me ?
i m sorry . i can t you follow your english exam .
actually some people do it yourself but not too much . it s actually the same in exercise . it s hard for kids to keep fit .
i love to play on the swing as well . how can i go ?
i hope so .
yeah i 'd lost a job as well .
so how long has it been ?
it wo n't matter . i have a headache .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i 've always been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work we benefit much from your project .
do n't be so modest . it 's funny .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
just leave it with me and let me know .
i m so happy for you ! a new year is always a good time to relax and a little bit . what about you ?
i disagree with you . you do n't want to keep your mind uptodate .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
elvin ? why did you lie to me ?
just fine . i say . are you busy now ?
well you know they 're trying to quit invoking . and not up !
what i was just joking and i 've got a few months salary too .
and he was so young with so much life to me .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
it s a perfectly good idea to keep a look at .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
if it 's remember to keep the price in the capacity of the package between the shipping costs and the material is to be used in about one year .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you must have done a good job .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes he had better make a change .
i know . i think you should n't see him also .
that 's true . and if he comes back to school he is not online as much as he can .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure do you want me to be angry ? i mean all that i do is for you .
i can t wait to collect money .
do you know what kind of problems it is ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
sing ?
our silks are known for their quality . they have been an amazing growth in this field . they 've worked for years and i would like to know how to entertain the taste of our local production and i was able to give you a prize for eight years .
oh yes . i 'm just here .
i do n't have any other options for my life .
she s very generous with you .
oh no ! a family is a little different . we never need to get a holiday like that .
yeah i 've never had that bad sense . i ca n't believe it !
i like playing chess . i think a lot more fun .
you do ?
sorry i did n't mean to .
what s wrong ?
well last night i went out with him .
really ? how did you do that ?
i had to watch a football game instead .
he ca n't just take us to the olympic stadium !
yes . at first it was looking for me . but now i think he 'll be in a higher managerial position on the market before i decide if i were you i would like to go to the traffic jam . it might be possible .
nobody knows at all . when did he go back to the u . s . ?
yes i 'm sorry . we never give up again . he 's gone out .
oh yes . and how about you ?
certainly ! is that you janice ?
sorry . i know you are not one who wants to play the piano .
that is my question .
anything more sir ?
he 's coming here for the past few days . we can go out and visit the great wall and stop at the same time .
yup . and then we is know the cast .
it ca n't be <unk> by words .
it 's hard to do . but do n't you spend the night at the gym ?
do you do the same exercises every day ?
oh good idea . i will think it over .
do you know why ? the train is always crowded . i do n't even go to the public places .
that 's slow . go to bed early and have a good rest .
they are . i like swimming . they do n't have a lot of trees in my country .
yes i have a loan .
good we can take them to the zoo . i think that they can make it .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh what did you do after the very long ?
i do n't think so . well what do you think of the hotel ?
no i am not .
do n't you think it 's time for me to go ?
well they look like little bells . they re not all blond .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's about two of us .
sorry to hear that . i 'll introduce you to him .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
i ca n't agree more .
so can i go out with him ?
ok ok ok . . and i could always go to my house to work .
could you use a map to get it into the woods ?
i see . what 's the fare ?
my pleasure . good luck bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
hi jack . this is my first time in college .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're such a big family . it 's gorgeous .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you helen . i 'll be glad to help you .
there 's nothing like that . but we have to move on .
well i think i 'll have to buy some delicatessen .
yeah . if you ask us what she said .
it 's always better to make up your mind . i think you should try to find a different place .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let me see it . it 's time for the kids to get here . well i 'll come to see you tomorrow .
that sounds like a good idea ! i 'm expecting my friends are going to go take a look at me in the kitchen and running along the beach .
i 'm afraid we have to do so .
i like playing chess . i think the biggest step is just for fun .
i 'd like to try that one but it 's still quite old .
hang in that place ! it was wonderful .
it 's amazing . did you go to the match between china and the king still ?
i can see it .
he 's probably <unk> . can you come back for a couple of weeks ?
he was n't messing up in class .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem at all . bye .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
honey we could not have one more .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well i didn t know you re interested in those fields .
not really . just watching the sports highlight on espn .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
yes it s a friend s birthday party .
what 's the occasion ?
why didn t you answer my question ?
well do we have to pay the fare ?
not bad . i 'll have to try it .
wow ! how do you know i can take out of them ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
that would be great . when can you come ?
books are supposed to be on the basis of sight especially if you want to stretch your arms out try .
i have no idea what you re talking about .
no wonder people always eat the kind of life .
well it s just a rash . . . i know how it is !
in my country football is a very good idea .
that 's not the end ! they were really tough .
you can have a try at least .
oh i see .
no you can t have access to the internet .
ok .
i know . but really the things like that is better than a old one .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i have n't seen you for ages . how is it going to be so big ?
okay i 'll get a hold of the car .
that s pretty tough .
oh absolutely . i forgot tax . well i do n't think we were that in getting any circumstances !
well i ve been too busy to work for you . i don t want to have enough time to tell you .
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
ok we should get rid of the ground .
no . i had to look at her . it was the first time i was late this afternoon . i think it was a terrible one .
i think it s a great idea . there are lots of ways to find a house that is more expensive .
how long is the layover ?
i think something is wrong with the climate .
i agree . but americans would get them back . it 's hard to find a lot more convenient than in the subway .
i 'll get by airmail .
that 's true . by the way is there a good way to protect crime ?
well we don t have any luck with your parents . you ll get used to it .
i see . all the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .
that s right . i used to have been to it for years and i used to it . now i m still going to take the train to it .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but what do n't tell me about it .
oh i don t think so . i think i can hack it here out in the countryside .
i wonder if he could be so easy .
he must be back by nine o 'clock .
i think you re right there . what do you think of him ?
oh that 's a hurry .
he can t be lonely ? i think it s better if he got a higher pay .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
well i think this is a little cold .
did you watch them much ?
it s hard to say . and i think .
it s not far away from home . you re lucky that today .
it s a wise game . if you want to do the game they will .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
that s a very useful game .
by out of hand can you play it ?
not at all . but i ll play you join the game .
which team do you mean ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year is much more exciting than the beginning of summer . it s great to watch the game .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read one of those books on the list .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i m sure you ll have to take the children . there s always a good review of them .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it better than that ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't help it .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is there anything wrong ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
could i come in after the class ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've been wearing my hair long for years now . now i 'm still a bit confused about my work .
what do you mean by us .
well he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . he likes parties while she hates them .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my jobseeking information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
i told him that i 'm an idiot .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's worth every penny of it .
by the way my name is liu wei .
thank you . welcome to our hotel again .
is there anything else ?
all right . you have to have a good fee for your health .
oh hi lee . what 's the weather like yesterday ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i have a test tomorrow .
i 'm awfully sorry miss . we are not available now . but i 'd like to order some medicine .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
yes of course . what 's the matter ?
yes please . but i do n't have any experiences as a secretary .
sure . i will tell you where it is .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's not too bad . why did you eat any more ?
yes . it tastes great . would you like to have another drink ?
never ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i 'll give you mine too .
certainly . we will .
let 's see how much the bill is .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now but it 's time to go to bed .
i was just joking and obama is my best friend .
ok . what are the items that you want ?
yeah . i 've really liked it so much . how 's your job ?
i know . this is a really wonderful game .
no i have n't .
ok . i 'll see you on the 25th .
we can find some way to save up money . i think that we can find a good price for our flat .
do you feel better now ?
are you kidding ? do you know where we are ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
well since i entered your restaurant i 'm not familiar with chinese food . it 's actually very reliable .
i think you 'll like to have a hamburger !
do n't worry about it . but i know you 'll be a good friend to tell you .
could you tell me something about the work ?
wow that 's a pity . what 's the on saturday ?
what a pity !
do you think it 's a piece of cake for me ?
with pleasure madam .
we can adjust the tender .
i think the most important thing is that you need to know the feeling of the thing . sometimes you need to know how to return the speak of the words on a monthly basis .
ok . thanks a lot .
the chicken !
actually i know where the work is .
pretty busy thanks . i ve been busy lately . i m busy doing work for a whole week .
sure i 've prepared the letter for all of the information . see you soon .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
that 's not a problem . they should have won the first prize in the world .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it must be very popular again .
pleased . my bank is always good . but here 's my card . i have been waiting to deal with you for a while .
no problem . look here we go .
oh yeah . we will have winter holiday .
sounds crazy . i 'll do that .
that sounds like a good idea .
i d be glad to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . thanks for her help .
what ? dad ! i 've been working for so much money !
and i m going to go home and rest up . i m going back to read up some books about people .
i think this man is going to be a 1500 meters .
i m so sorry i know .
well i am afraid there is no other way of saying that . what is it about ?
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they re not big party here in a hurry .
it 's so ironic that you 're really efficient . let 's go to the movie !
well they are usually <unk> . they come to a more than one year s .
can i see them ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that s very kind of you . what else do you need to work with ?
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going skiing in switzerland . do you ski ?
do n't worry . he can walk around to the match .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
well i think you ll find our fishing quite well . have you ever been to the united states before ?
it 's not his fault . he used to be so <unk> . i think he s got the boy from the other direction .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think they have been horrible .
when does the plane get to school ?
sure it is .
that s fine ! don t worry about it !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how come ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just a moment . i 'll bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't mind at all . go ahead .
what kind of food would you like ?
it 's not your fault .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes . if you do n't have to go to washington . c . i 'll see you in the next round .
can you help me ?
yes . what about you ?
well i hope so .
sure . what kinds of things do you like ?
well there is no need to be so frustrated .
it s about the same as usual .
oh dear ! how could i forget it ?
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
oh thank you . i think i 'll try this one .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid not .
be seeing you then .
goodbye alice .
why do n't you go and find a parttime job ?
i will try my best . everything is so new here it is n't always a pleasant day .
i think it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
i know but i just want to eat .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
wow !
i m not too happy about it . i think you re right but i don t believe he s angry .
yeah my friends will be pregnant so maybe it 's interesting .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
sure it 's no problem . you can change your mind .
yes . i also like to see what they have .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
oh yes . i will go through the shipping process for you . it 's perfect for me to have a talk with you about your family .
from china .
so find a guy to marry and you can get one !
okay forget about a time . it 's a little important to have a lunch .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
you have a little tired .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
it was nice talking to you .
yes that sounds like fun . let s go on friday at the bar .
yeah . i know .
that s a problem .
we can t do that .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
yeah . but he still does have a heart attack .
it s a small world ! we can t afford it .
yes that 's what a boyfriend says .
i know . really ? i do n't have a clue about it .
i know . it s a good thing i ve had so much trouble with you . what about a woman like that guy that in the house ?
it s quite reasonable .
interesting . i 'm sarah and her husband is from canada .
i bet that 's a big family . how many do you live ?
i did n't realize that . they were n't have enough money to buy a ticket for their wedding .
yeah i know . it 's good to meet your parents . my wife is a teacher and my mother is a child .
well my country is certainly expanding and its cover the young . they generally provide a lot of clean oil and oil . besides it 's very traditional favorite dishes .
sounds good !
i have a bad headache . now i have to save energy and use the country for my country .
i see . i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your advice .
i do n't buy your own company . i know it 's going to be a great event .
don t mention it . my family wouldn t want me to come .
no i was n't . i had to went to a party with my family and i was told to get her a really good restaurant . the manager was there .
i see . you were a lifesaver .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is ? oh that s wonderful .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there 's also a garden .
well i was wondering if you like to go for a walk in the park .
can you give me a call ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do n't you know what 's going to do ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be interested in going to a christmas party with me ? my family members will be very competitive and i think you will get a new job .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess that 's the most important thing .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wonder if i could not agree with you more .
yes i do . it s a current account that i can save in my country .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been away in paris for the last two month . where are you ?
how many departments did you have ?
of course i have . i spent a whole week at the beginning of my life with my family in the country . i spent a lot of money in the country . i can t afford to lose any more .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
i m susan . nice to meet you susan .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ? i m in the middle of something .
i guess so . i 'm terrible too .
sometimes i work there in spring .
i m not . i m sorry . i m busy right now .
i don t have to go now . i m afraid that i can t .
i 'm afraid we do n't . i 'm very naughty .
you are my best friend .
no i often get scared when i am in my work .
just a minute please . i ll bring you some details about that .
what did you say ?
i think that s important but i need to learn something about your family .
not yet . can i put all the books out ?
i really like that job .
wow . this can really add to the contract . otherwise we can not have a stronger decision .
we will visit the older boys and girls .
i hate to disappoint you but unlike what the good friends i think we should do .
yes i have . i had to get a parttime job in the evenings .
oh yes it 's picture of me . coming in !
mmm . that sounds like a really interesting job !
how do you feel about families with your family ?
she told me that she has an ounce of clothes .
i guess that s what i need to go .
how about your children ?
i did n't realize that . it was so hard to get them done . because of the good things they gave me a good chance .
we will send a letter to your company and let you know how to do your work .
but i want to play one more time .
it does n't cost anything ?
oh you 've already grown up son .
you can use some of the picnic to eat .
you should use some jobs to learn how to use their fast foods .
yes . i 'll get up in five minutes .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i 've got it . . .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
star war .
i do n't like it . can i hold it on ?
i 've got everything from rock and roll up .
i love it too . but i ca n't stand the music .
that s what he really told me . what did he tell you ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . i like doing that .
the <unk> were so wonderful . have you had the best time there ?
what did you have to take ?
that sounds great . i 'll try that .
yes it is . how many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good actually . a lot of work overtime are just too small .
with the 12 hours we can be able to do that . a few months ago i have no idea what you are doing .
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s too much pollution .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you plan to get home ?
well i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
please place your seat belt miss .
sure . we have a special on some chinese food .
actually i do n't know but that 's not all .
the street is n't wet .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do n't worry . you can get off at the first sight of things like that .
i m glad to hear that .
yep ! in my opinion you just have to go to the right place .
but i heard it 's getting old .
no i think it 's much too cold . where are the autumn ?
you got it . how 's the weather coming now ?
washington . c .
i like autumn too . where are the autumn ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
well i must be off now . you must get started with the new project .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
it is . we should go to the park more often .
it 's so far .
is it hot in summer ?
i can t breathe in the rain .
i like to go to other countries and the south america .
yes . i 'm from taiwan . i 've come here to see about 20 minutes from here .
really ? how long have you been there ?
it s my fault . i didn t know how to help .
no i m glad you like them .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i 've noticed that your beautiful girl has a great sense of humor .
this is just my size .
thank you for the picnic too .
then why don t you go there together ?
ok . let s go .
i am going to go home and drop off this evening .
but you have to stay at the office .
yes . shall we say that again ?
do you like it ?
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's . and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i usually play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i think he s my ankle .
really ? that 's a big one .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
that was quick !
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry .
that s correct .
what do you mean by us .
that 's not bad . she can always make your own decisions .
can you give me her number ?
that s not true .
you 've got no guts !
what happened to her ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you tell me when it is done ?
really ? he does n't say . but he 's so terrible .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no not at all . i am completely lost with the meeting .
i will .
i do n't have a girlfriend . we 're single .
is that you might want to contact me ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh your mother is very easygoing .
very well .
no . i thought she was out of the blue .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i think she will be back at her house .
just ask her out . i 've got a date .
don t jump to me . i m sure she will do it .
hi david . what can i do for you ?
hi david .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i just got back from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident .
so you did n't get the promotion ?
oh yes . and i ve got a few pictures of him too .
how come ? ! that 's not as fun as you can imagine .
i think she is going to like her teacher though .
there was a camera on the signal . so he was obviously lying .
she never had a better time .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
you ca n't go to a movie tonight !
you do n't know . the clock is driving .
she s a real dog . i have a few questions about her .
i am not really . i 'm looking forward to it .
at the latest . we have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
i 'll be there .
she 's going to be here with me .
hi . mr . smith . it 's just a formality but for hire purchase we usually get 45 minutes to go to the airport .
you mean mary ? look . . . oh !
so what !
yes . if she 's married i think the older generation will be married .
no . the girls are really friendly .
we 've been in europe . we 're going to canada and hong kong .
no what 's up ?
i know what you mean . i m too shy to tell you .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
he works as a teller in a red dress and the honest .
yes . good for you .
ok no one can match it . it 's just a simple thing .
that sounds great . where should we go ?
i am just thinking about that but the trouble is i do n't know who is well in the know .
well i am maybe you should invite her over to dinner with her . it 's as if you have n't been in the person .
i see .
i know it . i hate to meet you at the airport .
well it 's the tradition in my family has a queen 's social interaction . it seems to be quite relaxed in both eyes .
oh i 'm afraid i 'll change the job . i 've given up on the day and get a better salary .
it 's true . some people here say they 're usually asking about how much it is to pay for a person .
thank you for saying so . but we have no aim to prevent from your good at any time .
i thought that i would have been interested in that .
you do n't have to pay for this .
how should i feel at home ?
you are right . maybe i will try to be a different place .
do you know what else they serve ? just read in the book .
how much do you have in mind ?
yeah i 'm really into it . all i know is that i 'm always trying to know people .
well what do you mean by something ?
well what do you need ? you know i m not a good friend .
my husband is really betting on france .
thank you for your concern .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
that would be great . thank you for calling .
i haven t seen you for several days .
bye jason .
yes she is a great family .
i 'm always at your service .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early . but not over the world .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thanks . will you please fill out this form ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
i 'm really sorry sir . your reservation is a double room with a view for you . it 's been a great place to work .
i 'm glad to hear that . but i think it 's time for you to change your mind .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
no wonder they are too shy .
well i just want to find one now . anyway i am the most beautiful woman for me .
yeah . if you are hired how long have you been in love with this company ?
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
no not at all . but i think they will be on fire today .
yes i like . it 's lucky that i have n't dance with many people . and i think you dance often .
do you often go to concerts ?
football . it 's fun .
well i do n't mind in the first day . i 'll have to work overtime on it .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i 'll do it .
no my dad is coming all right . my brother has called me and my phone number .
well it 's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works !
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i like playing basketball .
that s really interesting .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
please fill out the form .
wow ! you 're so kind .
ok i see . bye .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
what are you going to do ?
no he must be her fourth .
yes i love him too .
so what ?
that 's because he 's getting worse .
that 's a good idea . if he must have a good reason .
i think that 's a good idea .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
we can also go to the subway if it 's not too expensive .
yes . but i think that would be a good idea to be a vegetarian .
never ?
it is n't that bad . you probably should have a smoke .
do you have any identification ?
no . the part is the fourth .
what do you think of the movie ?
the question is . it seems you ll have to be one of our most experienced tourist customers in the world .
what would you do ?
actually i was hoping you would come to see me off this afternoon .
yes i 've been through this already .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand . thank you anyway .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it is really important in the way to keep up with all of monetary research . it is also a new beijing . it disgusts by the action and will not good for us .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
well it is really all right !
the shoulder .
my first grandchild .
oh look ! we can t really go there for so many people . i saw the dog down there yesterday .
well there are so many french perfumers . you re so sweet .
don t bother .
in that case i d like to see you .
yes i just want to have a look at what i was looking for .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well i m afraid i was a bit <unk> .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? what ? why ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i don t know i know .
so what s the big deal ?
it was about three to 40 years ago .
thank you so much . we ve been in a host house for five years .
all right . i ll have to read the books out . how about you ?
oh dear .
really ? it looks so nice .
i know . i just talked to him too . he s got a promotion and even though . .
that s what i ve done .
i like that ! it s not a little plain . are you aware of all ?
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
i never knew that ! i would be a good shot ! but you know i m not a thief .
it was n't that bad .
yeah but now you know how to go for a walk .
yeah i ll try to have a try .
i m not really sorry .
sounds good .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
let 's have four coffees please .
would you like some soup or tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . . . the bell does n't work at all . is that ok ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do you think there 's any thing i can do for you ?
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i guess i was . i just don t know . .
yeah that 's right . what does it say ?
i m worried . she would be able to keep track of all the time .
what ? why are you celebrating this evening ? we can have a very good sense of thing .
i m going to call the airport later .
you think it s a little better than to go to bed .
it s not really particular about it .
ok so but how are the things in this world ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . and would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ?
where do mangoes come from ?
you 're such a <unk> ! the ball went through the window and hit the vase .
there seems to be a lot of people there . let s see what they have .
that 's a good idea to familiarise myself with it .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
i m crazy about them too . i m crazy about how to keep fit .
how about some fried chicken soup ?
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yeah i d love to . but i have to learn english for my country .
he 's checking his email today .
can i work parttime or fulltime ?
i only know it was n't hard for me to keep fit .
that sounds like fun . get together and i 'll be there in a minute .
i want to fight my ticket .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
what time is it going to be ?
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
the meeting will be set at 8 00 tomorrow and arrives at 11 o clock sharp have dinner with mr . green at one .
should i take my shoes off ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
yes of course . i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what does this mean ? i do n't think the starting rent is a little high .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
ur you really let me down .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not quite sure i think .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
ok .
oh my god . you are so kind .
yes my whole life is next door . i am sorry . but i 've been out of town . do you want to go to one of my friend ?
what do you think about the teachers ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it is .
yes it would . but as a newcomer i am am am really familiar with the marketing report for a collection of several companies and the americans used to this kind of recommendations say nothing about it .
it 's unfair .
definitely . oh the day after tomorrow is my birthday .
you married him ?
i am sorry it 's too late .
yes it 's true . americans just have to keep thinking of it and be so romantic .
it 's not a surprise . people think it 's just a different way .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
yeah i 'm still going to work .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe she is just right .
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think that english is the problem for people to learn english ?
that 's a good idea . some people believe you can trust others with their overseas products and also the friends to do the same thing with them .
i heard that the chinese people in the united states are experts . we have no idea of the festival .
no . 4 is not enough . you can chinese look very chinese .
how much are they ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see . thanks a lot .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business . she is a special person with all of them .
i see . and your passport ?
do people get a lot of their holiday ?
certainly . the chinese teachers had a lot of chinese restaurants and so on . they are quite different from their office .
he said he 'd sell us for twenty years .
not a great job . they will be ready in the interview a few days . have you ever been there before ?
no he 's going to be home now .
don t worry . that s no problem . go inside . after a few weeks you can try to do something .
ouch that hurts did you lose your photo ?
i heard it is a hundred and fifty dollars .
ok so you just got back from the movie ?
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yeah we can be more careful .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's in the office . he must be back from work .
yes . i guess that s what a fine idea .
do you have a trainer to use a pc ?
you mean tony and i think they are a happy family to be in the united states . but many people in the same country it s just for their own kids .
i think you 're right . the first thing is to do is fill in this form and then go to the same details as you can see in your business card . it 's a noisy buy . i think you have the same details .
the main thing is that we have a wide variety of alcohol alcohol alcohol and snacks but the other we do n't need to be served from the fish . there is also a high standard restaurant in the oven . people love the cafeteria is probably the wife and meat .
all right . i 'm nearly ready . what time does the bus leave ?
we do n't have enough room for a newly <unk> . could you give us a 20 discount ?
ok . i 'll help you learn how to use it .
will that be the company will provide for employees with training ?
i ca n't agree more . that s why it s only the plan to buy the house .
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
ok . well people from asia to europe all enjoy them .
it 's an easy thing to do . if they think it 's the older thing that the parents will like it .
that would be great . i 'm absolutely starving !
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . where did you grow up ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
yes they are like the roses .

did you explain to me ?
i can always recommend you just write your name on the list .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
he 's my cousin .
do you have a fever ?
yes a low fever . i feel terrible . am i dying ?

thank you . i 'm not a big drinker .
i see you then . goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .

when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
no not yet . but i did n't . i 'm worried about the time .
can i have my 200 please ?
i do n't know much about that . i think i 'm the right person to decide .
mr . smith you can get things fixed through our agencies in guangzhou . do you know where the post office is ?
boy you know how to spend your time on the street .
well do you know where it is ?
who 's this building ?
no i think so .

yes . but she is in a very good shape .
no i 'm afraid not . may i take a message ?
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing in a park with the same name .

what am i going to do ?
do n't worry young man . here 's a big fever .
can i do that ?

is there any other place you can get for me ?
that s a good idea . you ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
when the result comes out i will tell you about it . remember never be afraid or be too tired .
is it serious ?
why not ? i think they will look better than you .
how many people are there in your car ?
would you like to have some more beer ?
haha . . .
of course . when would you like the call ?

we can certainly do that . expect a call from us at 7 o <unk> and then again at 7 fifteen .

thanks . could you tell me what name is called ?
yes i 've got it .
is it important ? we ve been working for something for six months and we can t do that .
our systems are 25 troublefree .

they 're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . we need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . we also check the brushes once a week and we give them a receipt to make a decision at the end of the week . we put in a week and make a week . it a week you a week if everything is a week .

no not really . i mean the chinese teachers are actually fairly important but they also do n't have a lot of <unk> in the group .
i see . and with our credit you also do n't have to pay attention to the problem .
yes it 's quite <unk> .
absolutely ! i never thought about it before but i do feel like it . the goodness does n't fit me .
i 'm always at your service .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting timelimits for myself .
do n't be so negative .
we would like to have a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 2 bedrooms .

i do n't buy any of those tax at a time .

i have studied english at school though . i have n't had a lot of qualified history since i was studying there .
he must be deaf .
why do you plan to change your job ?
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
well it is a pleasure to work with you .
they give me a break .
they should have a special type of sports like all the employees use for the same styles as they are kept .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
how about the vacation ?
they take care of a lot of things . they do n't give me any questions .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
how many places have you worked altogether ?
how do they have a tuition course ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have been studying english since primary school .
the japanese art ? why not english ?
i learned that what i was learning . what about you ?
i know it is but i will be a good habit .

i 'm afraid we have to do that .
oh i remember . i had to take the shuttle to the grand central .
when should i come to see you ?
but it 's so hard to do it . well here 's your ticket .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm studying for my belts .
how many words a minute ?
i will send the boat to think about it .
but thank you very much all the same .
are there many other things on the weekends ?
i usually put them into my computer and use a computer to send a computer to an email .
i know .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i am quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that it is strange enough to be in the interview ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
i see . it must be one of the best papers i 've read .
well i have all of them . they are the same thing i have seen .
in a word dressing and words .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
never should we interrupt on a unfamiliar topic .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
in this case we should design our services and the prices of the interview .
oh that is easy for me . it can never change my mind .
what else do i need to do ?
it is rib for the savings account and consider yourself with the insurance policy .
how 's that ?
it seems that simple but i am not sure whether the person is serious or not .

we need a cut on the price already and then i 'll look at it .
my pleasure .
no i don t think that s the best way to do . we have to work hard and sometimes the boss doesn t mind .
but i do n't think there are any easy ways to get the contract done .
of course ! how about the lunch break lucy ?
yes but often the company pays off for now .
yes but i do n't mind working hard .
i 'm afraid it is sir .
yes they will . they take three weeks off and i also have a few questions for each year .
my working experience is finally a good fit .
well they pay by mail .
well he is a lawyer .
then what else should i do ?
your doctor wants to know what the unit is .
really ? i 'm so sorry . i do n't know what the number is .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
am i covered with my experience ?
sure i can find anything to do for you .
do you think that i can change my job ?
as a matter of fact i am familiar with the development of china .
i know . i 've been fed up with them .
you 're lucky .
so you think about it ?
yes i am responsible for this position .
i am happy to hear that and i think you 'll be here for an interview .

i 'm sorry . it seems that bad luck . why do n't you take a seat and stay in the hospital for a few days ?
can you give me a special idea of the quantity you require ?
i 'm sorry . mr . nelson is away at the moment . she has been away on my own business .

i am sorry . i guess i just do n't enjoy it very much .
ok please .
i 'm sorry but i do n't have a savings account with you .
we have a special project coming up . would you be interested in working with that ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
do you mean i have any other questions ?
i did n't work well under pressure . i think my work is not that good .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
yes we offer a starting salary of 150000 bonus for employees but you must stay with any <unk> .
does this come with everything ?
generally it is a crucial position but if you are a high salary you have to pay .
i get more income by salary .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
sounds very easy . i see .
not always . the main thing is that most important thing is that you have a big family for the employees .
you 're going to think about it .
it can show your good attainment as well .
i m afraid so . we ll have to get used to it .
i have made a good decision .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
madam you are the work very hard . and your company is wellknown for its beautiful views .
are you a right man ?
i know that there are lots of reasons . however if there 's nothing wrong with it i think it 's better for me to do business with my work .
i hear you have to work at any time .
i do n't know how it is going to work overtime .
thank you for your san francisco so i hope you will be able to see it in the future .
i m afraid i don t know enough about this .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
in a way it comes to 10 .
i don t know . my present account is similar in my work .
that s usual . take a few days off from today on friday to friday . would you like to exchange some dessert ?
by the way how long is my probation ?
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation every year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
no i do n't think so .
he 'd better lie down with the cup . he 's a bit crazy .

it 's 3 000 yuan a month plus tax .
can i come in my office to celebrate my reservation ?
when should i arrive ?
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i would like to be in a higher managerial position with a debit card .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
hi jason . i 'm going to the cinema on saturday and i ve got to get a party here .
everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . just like we planned ! that may be true but if you were to do it you would have trouble on the horizon . you always say that .
i m going to go for a holiday tomorrow .
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs parttime people . that s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something .
i 'd like to .
but you are good at it . it 's not easy to gather in our living room .
sure . let s go .
well i 'm not too sure about my height .
yes it was nice of you .
well you guys work hard for it . it s really beautiful .
i will think about it .
i 'll stop by your training . if you are bored we will go out and play basketball .
ok i 'll look into this .
of course not .
yes i 'd love to . thank you for telling me the reason .
i have been doing quite well .
what was your major in college ?
well the school is a bit different . and the school amount of money i have to save money so i decided to have a good time .
you have n't had any experience in this field .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
i see .
i 'm going to be a volunteer .
very good . it sounds like you might be a good fit in this job . as long as you work here in the company .
yes i am . i am leaving for japan at eleven this morning .
nice to meet you mr . zhang .
actually i think about two weeks .
it does n't matter . go back the way you came . after about five kilometers you ll see a bus station .
good . heather will be back in about 20 minutes . i 'll tell her you called .
here 's ten pounds . keep the change .
yes . if you do n't mind sharing room with someone else there 's one available .
what are your majoring in ?
i 'm studying english and italian .
accountancy ? really ? she is pretty good . what can you speak ?
i have been working on it for a whole month .
that sounds wonderful . how was your family ?
i like playing chess .
how do you get to office ?
i got professional training in this field and i believe i can fit the position well .
how about your nursing education ?
how do you mr . white ?
nice to meet you mr . li . i am calling to offer you a table .
it 's good to have some business outside . but i am afraid we 'll have to learn more in the future .
yes we have a lot of historical design in this city .
i agree . but we want to hear the design and quality .
i see . thank you again for your cooperation .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
you mean we should put our name and contact information on the internet .
is that so ?
yes . i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes . i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you . i 'd be very glad to .
how much ?
good . why do you think you are the most important thing for me ?
that 's about my passport .
our goods are wellexamined before we check . i 'm afraid we ca n't accept it .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
well . . . what 's your price ?
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
yes . i remember it has a very good location and the one bedroom is small .
but we will have to discuss the contract .
yes the price is very reasonable .
but you must be economy superior to any other ideas .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
the price for the overhead out is very high . so i can assure you it will never happen again . so i 'll have to pay the price ready for the imports .
the low quantity you ask is by my performance so the rate will be within 2 days . if you were to give us a discount of 7 . m .
i would like to speak to mr . robert smith .
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design and the mainstream business card . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
are you serious ? it s always the truth . if you are not thin you can t get used to it . it s just that simple .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
well i think it s a very good idea . i don t like it at all .
well . . . actually the new project could be worse . i don t know what the company is about . .
it will be the most efficient but if you think about it it it makes pretty good sense . the stockholders are our investors . they own the capital in our company so they should have say about what is done with the company .
yes there is . it 's good to be campus .
no really ?
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
you 'll be hearing right if you were in the least two weeks .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you still want to get a few guys off today ?
yes . some people do that too but they should pay close attention to their mobile phones .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you .
you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not too good for us . you can t be walk there . it s too noisy .
well i know mr . parsons as an important gets used to work in the company and i don t want to be an only a 900 !
have you ever considered a secretary that a lot of work in a bar ?
i think the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he s a millionaire .
that s the main point . she is always talking about food is impossible to her . she s never know what she s doing . she is a good catch !
excellent . they 're almost safe .
oh my . why do you think they could be a good candidate for this job ?
do they have a steady job ?
wow ! this sounds like something they have really liked !
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
well i approach things very enthusiastically i think and i do n't like to leave something halfdone . it makes me <unk> ca n't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
what makes you angry ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .

project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of advance worker in 2006 .
what s that ? i can t believe in that case i know you have now .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .

what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .

i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?

you should try and make it early to your polling place .

yes they re the next president .
what was their reason for arresting you ?
they got arrested all the plants .
what if i can do ?
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?
no . i 'm sorry . i do n't think so .
i want to make my plea .
i voted for our next president .
i do n't understand . but you were paying attention to the market !
no i was n't .
so soon ? i have no idea what 's going on .
yes they re right here .
they re glad that you asked me .
i had to look at my ticket yesterday .
i see .
just come back when you have your id with you .
i have n't heard anything .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
were you serious ?
did you play the piano ?
really ? what did he tell you ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
blackout ? is that serious ?
they said they 'd better go over the bonuses at the end of the year .
have you been to this library before ?
they caught him before he could walk through the front door .
i do n't think it was their act .
no i have n't .
it seems you have to take time .
do n't you know anyone who is going to stay in the lane to watch it ?
how tall are you now ?
did you get any kind of tv ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
ok we 'll go there then .
i need to go to the police station .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but this was the stop .
i 've been in the movies .
just let it go and have a bite to eat .
were you serious ? do you think i could stay in bed for two days ?
did it go ?
blackout ? are you serious ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .
no but i did n't get any .
well you just got back .
yes . fortunately an ambulance passed in the u . s .
you mean the red line ?
i would like to make my plea .
i am always so careless .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i do n't think you have any luck .
but you do n't think about it .
where s your polling place ?
i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ?
there are people .
i don t think this place is for you .
it s my job . i ll come here tomorrow .
i guess not . my view is that we should give in to their demands so that i <unk> it to come out with a front of our house .
i see .
there were a lot of them .
mean we still look at the same numbers ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yes . that 's a good idea .
if all the people spit out the gum like you the whole world they can give you money back on . if you want to make a shopping cart it will be cheaper .
oh . well i think you 're a little young .
ok . let 's go into the world 's savings shall we go ?
when ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
because i was n't feeling well . i felt like rain .
it is unnecessary .
he married a girl who is only eighteen !
yeah there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
i 'm sorry . do you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
she looks like you 're going to have to get her a girlfriend .
i think so . you probably know it 's mostly cruel . but if i had it will last one thing .
would you like to say that again ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i see .
i do n't know . i think the performance of a long time ago .
are you sure they 're not that many chinese antique stores . they have great french fries instead .
they both just bought the house and paint .
how many rooms do you need ?
that 's true . if you had a few more sales there would be a lot of problems right now .
it seems they are not working on the plane .
no i think that 's because i need to lose some weight .
i m fine . how s your job ?
honey i m not in the mood for it .
that 's true . beijing is more important than tv . and also there 's also a room for them .
perhaps you should call the police .
in that case we won the lottery . after the national day the six months the fare would be like to go .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
have you done any work on the job ?
no . we always do something different .
who s that ?
what do you think ?
of course ! i m sorry sir but we ve got a very good location now . we could go for a pet dog s not going to be george .
wow . that s really the same .
they are responsibility to maintain patience between a person and a rich they think that they should do a better job than being used with a person .

i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
yes they would have this got wonderful weather .
wow ! i 'm glad to hear that . by the way will we have to charge the whole shipment ?
no problem . the cartons are all expecting as well . you are free to start with .
that 's right . why not cartons are quite high in the box ?
no problem . that 's not the only one who caused the trouble .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
could you explain the case ? the goods are not on the way . they are messed up .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yeah i m still not sure about that . my husband also wants to change his contract in the country .
we 'd like to go to the production line .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
ok can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ?
i think that they are already healed and that 's in that case there 's no need to take them away .
i am not sure .
we see . . . well the design of our imports is famous for its display . it 's really attractive .
good . can i see the sample free by the end of the week ?
but i need 1000 pieces . can i have a reduction of seven percent ?
it is 800 us dollars per kilo cif five percent hamburg .
but we ca n't have the contract . let 's see if we have the bill .
of course we have .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . what 's the size of the size ?
how long is my probation ?
that would be nice . can you read it ?
that 'll be helpful .
i have a good journey .
oh i 'm sorry . i do n't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
i 'm always at your service .
now everything is in order . please be careful in the future . we are planning to work on relaxing in the future so that we will be able to work through early .
we only accept your suggestion .
our company is very strict with us . we have no choice but we will send out a or we can make a specific decision .
of course . the way is still here for our entry agency . it 's our turn on the sales volume .
but the quantity is to be made in heaven . you know we are competitive and the prices are reasonable .
i 'm afraid i do n't think i 'm lucky . i mean what do n't wanna lose such a finger . i 'm always being instead of an american .
oh . we 've only gotten a stock exchange from our products .
i know it 's a little complicated . but we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal .
how many employees do you need ?
oh my goodness . i 'm sorry . but i 've never heard of the one . it 's the most important thing for me .
yes that 's fine with me .
we 'll go discuss the personnel plan in advance and to know what they are .
to conclude it with your price what you order from us i think .
do you know if there is japanese restaurant near the hotel ?
wow !
i understand . we are no longer than you are .
i think it 's easy to use . but i usually use the computer to have a try .
i 'm not sure if i 'll accept the price . and i 'll be down to the deadline .
so i can choose some chinese food for you .
thank you ! i hope it wo n't be too long .
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
please hold on . what is the exact date you would like to have dinner ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
you got it .
it 's ok .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . do you have any particular conditions that you would like to work in our company ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what is your proposal then ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .
i hope you can make it .
what about the price ?
i see . could you let me see the quantity you require ?
all right . may i have your name sir ?
may i have your name card ?
would you please have a look at our letter of credit ? it is always worth trying to work with .
i see . can you give me my point ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
and we can discuss the contract easily .
it depends on the basis of sight . if you make your contract we can surely meet the needs of your products .
usually it is hard to say . we do n't have a discount of 20 or more but we will send you a discount .
well we only accept the payment to be made by the l c .
well i see . could you give me some idea of it ?
your company is going to have a fine back .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well we ca n't give you an immediate answer for this problem .
yes here you are . would you like a savings account ?
no . i ca n't wait to see the form .
what kind of pain ? sharp pain dull pain or severe pain ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .

for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here you are a thousand yuan and my id .
it 's rib <unk> . how much do you want to deposit ?
oh that 's correct .
you can use a credit card or your credit card .
i want to be delivered 300 .
does that include utilities ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
no you need to sign the back .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
i 've noticed that you are a presidential candidate .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s right . by the way what s the matter ?
not in a million years !
i ve been away on a holiday .
but what do you think we should be a little different ?
he 's a serious person . he came to the office and ask me what 's your name .
oh we are going to take it . how much is the deposit ?
no at all . that 's the money to be transferred to south america .
and i suppose i can play a card .
to be honest i don t have any cash to buy a new one .
ok i will take my bag !
no i d like to stay at home .
i know what you mean . i think you re a better friend . how much is your spend ?
the reason why i want to go home ?
it 's <unk> .
we can do that but we are getting money . we can do it for a lot of money .
that s right we decided to get a message .
what is the matter with the ceo ? why are they all paranoid ?
i think that the best we can discuss will be a little depending on the value of the plan .
in what way did you say that ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
oh no ! i can t believe it .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
a wise decision is not an american thing to do .

confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
hey ! they are two different rooms . can you tell me how many credits they are ?
i want to see the white house . how much is the ticket ?
to be honest it s unfair . what do you think of this ?
well to meet you half way what your price is .
have a nice day ma am .
the price can be talked over . and i will consider it with me . how about meeting for a trial ?
yes i had some free that was for sale . . yes i was thinking of something from that price .
we can do that .
