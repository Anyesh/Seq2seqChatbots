i think it 's a block away .
what are you going to do ?
no it 's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let 's get on . oh no judy ! get off the bus quickly !
oh . . . i 'm better take the subway . it 's faster and much cheaper than bus .
we got on the wrong bus .
jack . nice to meet you .

i was hoping to come in at 630 a . m .
just a moment sir . i 'll check with the kitchen .
yes of course . what kind of room are you in ?
mr . smith you are booked on july 21st for 4 nights .
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
tom has gone to lunch .
you have to take the subway to get a student bus pass .
okay how about friday afternoon ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i will .
not very expensive .
would it cost me a lot more ?
help will be there in just a few minutes .
how long will it take to get there ?
is there a dot after com ?
sure . just a minute .
thanks . i really appreciate it .
next week .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
i 'll call the office first time .
cool ! let 's go !
at pier five .
yes .
no . not very far . it s near the entrance .
do you really think it s a good shot ?
do you know which one he would like ?
i will .
well this is the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . and i know that song very well so i did n't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well .
i am not like it at all . i am not a beginner in chinese .
yes i do n't mind the song of the song . i am a song writer and i have never had time to sing .
is there a room available ?
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
it does n't matter . no one will laugh at you .
no i do n't like the one . my name is boring .
i 'm sure you 'll be a good friend .
oh thank you . but i 'm not a very good singer . you should have sung it in love music .
thanks mr . johnson .
right . that 's good .
i do n't know what you mean ! i 'd rather watch it .
hurry up .
oh that 's all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .
oh i am sorry . i did n't catch you .
i must have been missing a lot .
yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .
what kind of case do you want to get ?
oh no . this is the first bus you can take .
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to change it for the machines .
oh ! thank you very much .
what time are you leaving ?
well it s a dutyfree shop . you can see the safety of the family here .
i need to pay my bills .
ok . could you come with me to the supermarket ?
no i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
have n't i asked you to call if you 're going to be home late ?
you have to pay more than that . i think it 's better than the insurance company so i have to pay for it .
let 's see . from here you have to take the 278bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
sorry this biography is over the deadline . you should pay extra for it .
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
is the bus station close by ?
the price for a tenday tour is only 1099 us dollars which includes a wide range of products and can be shown during the weekend .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
oh i can have a sweet dream .
i 'd like to try a new style .

i 'd like to buy two bottles of brandy .

i want to put this curtain up .
i can see . where is it ?

no i 'd like them . they are very tasty .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?

i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
i 'd like to try a new style .
how about the japanese ones ?
yes i 'd like to be a singer . i 've heard that your company is very interesting .
his looks like a win but he has an amazing voice .
thank you . i 'll take one .
yes . but i think it 's <unk> . you ca n't miss it .
can i also take some souvenirs ?
good . and also prepare a good gift for the worst .
do i have to get up now ?
check the drawer .
what 're you talking about ? my alarm hasn t even gone off yet .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i must have slept right through it .
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !
cheers !
are you all right ?
yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i 'll have to go to the english corner tomorrow .
it 's my pleasure . we have single rooms double rooms suites and luxury suites ect . well here is the room .
so the guest will take you to get prepared .
i 'll go get a shower but a little physical pain will make you feel better .
you should n't take it too seriously . it 's just that i 'm sure you 'll enjoy your size .
no i 'd rather have hot water .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
could you tell me what ?
the maximum one is 1500 .
i 'm still suffering from jet lag .
i 'm going to do some shopping .
that 's harsh .
oh no you ca n't do that at all .
yes but i am really worried about her .
and how about you ? do you need one at the back or two ?
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
it looks great . but this machine is on the market .
here is your change . thank you .
i 'm sorry . my mom 's did it for you .
is it possible for me to buy some rib at this time ?
i do n't think so . i m very busy .
well i am afraid i have to pay a monthly salary .
it depends on the best offer . if you order a large amount we can make it for you .
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
it 's about two miles away . that 's a bit too big .
should i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
ok .
do you have a lot of friends ?
oh yes it 's on the second floor .
could you reserve a copy for me ?
bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . you see it as you turn left . seriously you ca n't miss it . it s enormous .
i 'll look at the car park over there .
yes i 'd like to look for a missing bank .
oh yes i know exactly where we 're at .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . i will .
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .
i 'd like to try a new style .
sorry but i 'm afraid not . these are too many others .
oh these are exactly what i m looking for .
no i have n't .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
but they are n't allowed to go to another planet for each . the view of the city has has been experiencing a major source of its popularity .
for example in china it 's okay to talk while eating . however you may regard it as rude .
you mean this one ?
well i like the styte but i do n't think the color fits me . could you make it a little too ?
the price for one person who has 5 kilometers a mile at the end of the week .
oh dear . it s too expensive . can you give me a better price ?
i is looking . can you tell me which one you want ?
that 's true .
they are announcing your flight . you 'd better board the plane .
no . it 's completely different . but she knows how to work with it .
that 's too bad . but i can t go there with that .
that 's great ! i will have a try .
i 'm sorry sir but this was the weather . and there 's a lot of it .
i m going to spend some time here . i don t want some money on my money !
ok . i will pick you up at six thirty .
are you kidding ? they re the dinner party this saturday .
how many years have i designed to know ?
it is so terrible . i was just thinking of getting a little bit of a child .
oh i just want to try them on .
i see . all right . but where can i be money ?
you said you can <unk> with a credit card .
ok ! you 're all set ! come back with me to your seat and eva will be right with you .
i hope so .
that depends on how much you want to invest .
let 's look at our menus .
this will help you to choose .
your dream comes true now . do you know that the altitude of the mountain ?
ok . i will deposit my bag right now .
good idea . i have a couple of beers right ?
well . . . yes you look really pale .
i was born in three years .
do you have to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?
how do people use them ?
its <unk> will be a big surprise to you .
well that s true . i m never gonna keep my mind . what s the problem ?
it 's so beautiful here . i want to stay longer .
oh a nice handkerchief . that 's a great idea . i 'll take it .
maybe we can try some new style then .
can we walk along the hill to the cave ?
how about a china vase ?
i think we should go do some jogging . you know how hard it is to make .
sure . i 'll take this one .
but i was thinking of buying them a day . now i m going to miss them .
maybe we can find a parttime job .
any special effects ?
ok . i 'll have a try .
thank you . please have a cup of tea .
what 's the brand ?
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
i 've got it . well i think we 'd better go over the we have the new bar .
i 've been working a lot lately .
it 's hard work while exercising but it is a great feeling when i get done .
yeah . it s hard to believe that physical exercise may help us to keep fit .
yes i know what you mean . do you think we can do something else ?
i 'm afraid i do n't know what to do .
did you know that the the traffic forecast is not correct ?
i hope so .
yes . this is something really important to be in the united states .
i understand . you ll feel much better than not eat but perhaps you could have a try .
but we have a reservation for you . i 'm sorry to say no . we 've got an important car .
i have a terrible headache .
it looks like you have n't eaten anything all day .
well i want to mail this package .
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
what about the damage to my car ?
at 10 o 'clock .
ok . i 'll take it .
what are you going to order ?
yes . but you are going to be there at least seven weeks .
well you are doing a good job .
all right . when shall i get the phone number ?
i will . that 's all i need to do .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
the gas stations are usually full .
regular please .
give me a break . i will stay here tomorrow .
five hundred and fifty .
you do ?
no you can peel the vegetables with the chicken .
your name and room number please ?
do you know what to say to comfort you and give the price of the chicken ?
do you want to order some dessert ?
that will be a long journey .
i 've also been busy .
about a year i know . i was n't thinking about getting a pizza that i really needed to eat .
i 'll have a dozen .
it was really a long time . i am sorry to say that .
it s been a few days since last night .
oh . i swim a lot but now i 'm taking gym classes .
will you do a good job ?
i 'll give you a ring next week .
but i get sick of work and i never understood things like that . the office is over me everyday .
i 'm sure you 'll be a good student . i 'll get a new picture on the internet .
i guess i 'm not interested in tv .
now tell me what you often eat .
no but only if i have a few minutes . i often listen to music .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you can spend a lot of weight .
about three times a week if i can .
i 'd like to try a new style .
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?
no i 'm good .
i want to give you a ticket .
this is the last one . what a pity that the other team won t damage it .
i have a great balcony with an incredible view of the windows and a lot of sunshine .
how much is the tape record ?
sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint .
so this is going to be a <unk> .
that 's great .
i 'm waiting . . .
well i guess you are right . what about the buffet ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
today 's weather is so unpredictable .
oh i guess i can do that .
oh i like it . there are so many dishes . i am sure i can get them for you .
we have steamed chicken braised pork and beijing roast duck and so on . here it is .
how many pieces of ice cream do you have ?
that 's my favorite . i 'd like to have some vegetables .
yes . i 'll have the shrimp cocktail to start .
you 'll be fine !
that 's a good idea . you can always find some weight to exercise .
yes i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
sure . what about the very old one ?
well this one looks big enough but it 's not a carpet .
i guess not right . he did n't wear well either .
thanks a lot .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
yes i do . i like the design of this page and i write it as a <unk> gift .
the customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . that 'll be 16 . 00 .
well they are 168 .
i 'll take this one .
i do n't know . maybe my husband bought me some photos .
thank you . i have done a lot of research and newspapers .
i think so . i bought it a lot . it 's very expensive and they both look nice .
let 's take a look at the kitchen .
i 'm sorry sir .
no wonder .
i think so . i think i have met quite a few months ago .
i ca n't believe it . let 's go !
sure what we will have to take a taxi ?
no mom . i think i 'd better not . my sister is waiting for me .
what a great idea ! she looks like a lot of fun .
yeah . it 's fun . and it 's really cool .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
i am not certain about that . i want to buy a new one .
do you think it 's just that i was n't too confident ?
may i have one of these suits ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
have you made a good choice ?
well i do n't quite like the smell .
here is the catalogue and the hardcover .
i do n't think so . i think the color fits me well . could you give me some more information ?
yes . i 'll get one .
i see . well what do you recommend then ?
sure what would you like ?
where do you live ?
you will be honest with me on my own .
you know what ? i mean . i 've been working hard but not over it .
our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited but it 's not all .
well there is a kind of socket that we use on the board but they all have to give us the black tie and all the other office automation equipments like fax copier a screen a screen printer and scanner and it will be very convenient .
well this year we were able to use up our own equipment . it was exactly a challenge for all the time .
well it certainly does n't have all of them but also the ones that are really hospitable .
no i 'm not sure i want to get it .
sure . come on in please .
do you turn the lights on your shirt ?
are you a freshman in college ?
i 'll make a special decision .
ok . what kind of bag do you have in my bag ?
yes they have had a table for two .
i get it pretty bad . my whole face turns red including my ears .
then i will arrange someone to come and have a look at the seafood restaurant .
sure . we have to take a shower .
well this is a good idea to start with . i know it s a good idea to get a discount .
yes . i just checked in on the table .
oh we 've already seen several kinds of watch . which one do you prefer ?
it depends on the quality . if you order to lower the price we will give you a 10 discount .
well since it 's summer and i had looked that you had quite a bit sun i 'll recommend our summer special it 's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
yeah . we can find it .
sure . this way please .
i would prefer the blue one .
it is very cold in the winter and i think it 's worth the time .
i got them . let me give you a discount .
i got it . where can i pay for it ?
this god was a huge market research before we were running on the market .
i 'll do that . but i 'd better get back to you .
which one ?
i 'm sorry sir . what seems to be the trouble ?
i think you 're right . hopefully with a factory to work .
duh . . . that 's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus i 'd like to buy some winter clothes for my friends .
tell me what you need .
yes it s . it s half ceremony .
i know . it s a pity because it s not too expensive .
no . i 'm afraid we 're having a sale now .
but i want to watch tv now .
thanks . i 'll wait here .
yes . i 'm ready to go to the restaurant .
i think this is fresh . i 'll take it .
now is there anything you need to do ?
sarah . i think we could live in the city .
they will have this five .
okay . i 'll see you then .
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
have a pleasant stay .
yes i 'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . make it hot please .
here 's to our friendship and health !
let 's do it .
is that that pretty good ?
it is the best soup and this is the first time for you .
it 's not that much . are you sure ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
i 'd like to cash it for me .
what 's the charge for that ?
ok we 'll have a great dinner .
it 's a pretty short trip .
well it looks great from the curb . let s go on inside .
i believe it .
i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
let me see . yes it 's my name .
what 's the reservation number ?
oh i 'm afraid we have to reschedule you for another time .
it 's a room <unk> .
well in that case we should n't have any rooms available for the party .
then would you you give me the table ?
they 're on the way to commemorate a great meal !
and remember us when we 're ready to place the rest of the whole order .
will he be back soon ?
spring will come soon .
but i think you should be able to find a place to get something for the apartment . it 's hard to find an apartment .
yeah i think you 've got a bad memory .
that will make our offer next friday .
why ? that does n't make it .
you missed a court appearance .
let 's give them a hand .
well we did n't use any of the internet . but if you have any other outside income from our company we can get it fixed through soon .
maybe . i 'd better get some exercise for my health .
did you have the new house or the bathroom plumbing ?
why did you find the most interesting house for you ?
we can check out the kitchen next .
would it cost a lot more ?
yes we can give you a big house on the list .
then what about your parents ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if i were you i would take a look at it .
no not the really do n't you think it s a good idea to give our customers a good impression on the internet ?
it 's not as bad as i thought .
ok that sounds like a good idea .
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
of course . your train is valid for three days . i have to take a car .
all right . i hope we 'll have good working .
oh yes . turn right at the traffic light and you 'll see it on your left .
one dollar . drop it in the box . move to the rear of the bus . there are plenty of seats in the rear .
the price goes down well with traffic jam . it 'll be easier to get back .
thank you . what s the fare ?
good evening . we want a dinning room with a table for eight .
i 'm so happy for you .
yes we do . may i have your name please ?
what s on ?
john anderson .

i 'm so happy for you .
no thanks i 'll pass . it looks very tempting though .

ninety dollars is pretty steep . i 'll take it for sixty bucks .

oh yeah . i 've got it somewhere . let 's go to the hotel .
yes . shall i ask you a few minutes ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
i used to take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i appreciate the offer but i am still pretty sure you will get the right one .
no . i need to make a transfer .
ok .
hi .
well i ll look over it . thanks .
i was pretty sure if it were n't too much of a bother .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
oh i 'm sorry .
right . i ll look in the paper . i think we ll have to get a new one .
will it take long ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't . we accept credit cards and cash .
you have stayed for 6 day . here is your bill .
when can i have the room ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
that 's right . this one is of the best quality and elegant style of daily quality .
i 'm sorry but i 'll change it .
it s on the meter . i guess it 's not too expensive .
could i pay by traveler 's check ?
ok here you are . we have several different kinds of postal saving services . they have different interest rates .
i appreciate the offer but i am still pretty sure you will get the right one .
no . i need to make a transfer .
well you 'd better take an umbrella .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
who else is taking ?
do you take care of them everyday ?
sure . here you are . they 're all handmade .
i 'd like to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?
well . this one here just came out . it 's got great 3d graphics and a cool story line . it 's also got a <unk> function so you can play against other people on the internet .
i like the style . it 's very fashionable .
i prefer the no one .

excuse me but i like some of the latest songs .
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
not bad . it makes me look younger .
i 'll give you one .
yes i think so . how about the others ?
no the green dress is too small for me .
maybe you should look around for an outlet .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
got it . to whom should i report ?
yes . and you 're a professor in need of a shop that can be seen by anyone .
can you read the names of the two things we do ?
i 'm looking forward to it . what about the vacation on your back ?
i have a cell phone . but i do n't want to go to the computer store .
well we could use public transport instead of taking our subway system to get things done .
ok thank you very much . by the way what shall i do if i check the books ?
ok i 'm going to go see a cell phone .
sure ! and they 're really asking for their call .
i 'd like to try a new style .
yes here you are . they are all on the shelf .
they 're ok but they 're not very fashionable .
i see . well my friends are not very good at cooking . i love the warm up .
no . i 'm afraid we have to reschedule our bill for the next interview .
yes i am feeling the baker price . it 's not the same as i did .
they sell pieces of fried chicken . you know they 're not actually quite expensive .
you know i think you should give him some kind of stuff . but i 'm sure you know how hard it is .
well if you ask him i can tell you the truth . that means he 'll be mad at the bar .
me too .
mmmm . that 's nice and i 'll take this one .
yeah ! i know i am thinking about buying some stamps for example . but . . .
maybe you 'll see !
oh it 's a disco . let 's dance .
we usually eat chicken pork and beef . you eat these meat a lot in your country too do n't you ?
yes i eat a lot of vegetables .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine then .
i will .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
i get the shopping cart . i 'll get out of here and come . i 'll be right back .
get the jam and butter while you are out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this bread but i do n't think she will be able to start .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
what else are you going to wear ?
is there a lot of charge ?
yes . we re on a special day .
i am calling to talk to someone about it .
it must be an old book .
in that case i should have a discount for one .
give me a sec .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
let me have it .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
you 're right .

that 's right . what 's this ?
seventy us dollars .

it is unnecessary .
we will see you at the end of the street .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
all right . i see you tomorrow . thank you very much .
it 's better than the subway .
how much is the ticket ?

do you want it with everything ?
yes . i 'll have the shrimp cocktail to start .
we have two dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
i 'd like to have medium .
i m afraid i can t do that . so i will have to take care of the <unk> .
oh i see . i 'll have a beer please
i d say he 's a bit fed up . he s a terrible habit .

if you want to be macho husband would you care of any of his eq ?

i 'm very sorry .
it s about a tenminute walk .
how far is it ?
do you take care of them everyday ?
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
sure . it 's down this street .
is it a long way to get there ?
actually i do n't have the slightest clue .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
no . it 's only a <unk> walk . you ca n't miss it .
i 'll take the subway .
do you take care of them everyday ?
sorry but i m not really that interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i don t care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
can you speed up a bit ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
yes the library is next to the adminstration building . the adminstration building is over there near the school s main entrance .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
oh yes i think it 's the biggest city in china . the biggest city can be a daily .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . most of the chinese students pursuing higher education in australia intend to return to china .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes i really need to remind them of my own anniversary .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
this sheet tells the customer and color that s right . here s the receipt .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you look nice .
yes of course . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
this is kevin .
no . i 'm not really out of town . let 's go .

would you like to go now or later ?
it 's a place in southwest china .
oh yeah . she s going to be a great mother .
hi i m making a shopping budget so i ll have to pay my bills back .
i 'll take one .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
have you ever been there before ?
the chef is going to be very happy with her .
well i am sure you will love this .
it s a pleasure .
do you want to go to the cafeteria ?
which restaurant ?
well . you know most of the customers are free from america .
let 's go to the back to get a pair of the lake .
no thanks . that will be all .
what kind of soup would you like ?
i usually have a bowl of cigarettes .
i 'll have a sandwich and small fries . would you like to have some desserts ?
845 lincoln avenue .
i 'm sorry . sir . we value all of our customers regardless of circumstances .
here is our friendship and health .
hi . i need to get up early to get this morning .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i was denied a visa ?
yes i think so . let me take your temperature . you ve been home this way .
but i would like to pay for it now .

ok boy . i will buy it for you .
great . maybe we can study and play games together . i think we can be good friends .
where do i put it in ?
sure . i am cooking now . let 's order a bottle of wine .
do you want to choose any appetizer for half an hour ?
this is one .
this morning we rented a car and we are on the way to <unk> falls . i 'm afraid we have a car accident near the border .
i know a place that is very good .
great . i want a hamburger and a large portion .
oh about 600 .
that sounds all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
great ! when will we have them there ?
oh yes i 'm fond of doing that . i 've never heard of it .
i heard about that . the subway rate is much higher than the public .
which one of them do you mean ?
that 's something that you really need to work on .
i 'll take it . well it 's not as i expected . we should learn more from the city .
why ? i have never thought of that before .
you are the best choice for this position .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes on the top .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
i agree how much ?
the results are too slow .
sure i 'll have a coke .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
stirred or shaken ?
where is the fitting room ?
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
how do you want to apply for it ?
do you think you can get me there seven thirty ?
enjoy yourself .
i have never learned anything from the menu . what would you like to see in a friend ?
actually i do n't like ice cream with too many sun to people .
i like ice cream . can you recommend it ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
i do n't think i can have a try .
in my opinion a coffee and a strong rest is very important .
are you kidding me ? i ca n't believe it !
italian . they are very delicious .
i would like to have the bean curd .
well i 'm sure i 'll have a good memory .
hang on ! i have to be there .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
tell me about it .
they are <unk> . you can choose from the menu . the same thing in our hotel .
cool ! what 's that ?
ok . i will go get it .
thanks . this should only be a few minutes .
i 'm so happy for you .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you think that the food is wellmatched ?
what are the hell of this ?
for the sake of all they have had been going on for quite a long time . once i start to china i may take them shopping and then they leave for a long time . but it will be a real later .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
every one is the cheapest on the west side .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
please drive slowly we 've got to the flu . i 'll call her later .
is she going to be able to make her own decision ?
like what ?
do you have a job ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well can you check whether you re interested in this position ?
thank you . i ve got a lot of work here .
this is our office block .
are you scared of anything ?
we have a nice selection of products . which kind of items do you want ?
how do you plan to do your present job ?
may i know what you do ?
do you have a car ?
and the roses will be fine .
what ? did you say that ?
my husband sent me a lot to do that but he still does n't seem to know it .
some more chinese tea for us please .
what do you want to do ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that sounds fine but i 'll tell her to give you the assignments from english class .
we still need to go to bed early .
oh i see .
yes . but why not ?
yes sally . you just want to know what the good news is .
ok . i 'll call bob and let you know when she is .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
let 's do it .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
that will be fine . she will come in and have them ready by then .
have you thought about having a drink at the restaurant ?
what 's her figure ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you ever need anything else i can do for you let me know .
ah . . . i got a pizza and a burger .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
mr . smith did it say yesterday . we had a bad service yesterday . our boss made the reservation for us .

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah i am sure you can find that .
i was denied a visa ?
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . what were you thinking of getting ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well let 's see . how much is this ?
well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . in that case we can give you a discount on the skirt . but do n't you think it will be expensive ?
it 's so easy . some of them are pretty laid back .
are we going to do that ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .

i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i see . the faint of heart should not apply . i think we have a nice shot .
what ? i do n't feel like sitting there at home like that .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
how can i go ?
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well i 'd like to get a discount .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you like it . we are glad that you like it .
how about oil or spray ?
is there a special rate for a room ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
i 'd like to have it done this weekend .
could you please reserve it for me ?
your flight takes off at 8
you could n't be serious .
all right . i am free .
well my saddle is too low for me .
could you tell me what time you will be home ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you do to a car that you do ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well it 's a actually in aisle a .
a dozen with blue means .
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
why do you want to be a singer ? i have n't seen the piano for a long time .
20 a dozen .
can you describe their taste ?
what about some green salad ?
but they are n't as fashionable you see .
do you think they can place things in taiwan ?
look nice fresh cherries ! they are ripe and soft . i 'll take some .
most of them are from america and europe .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well they are 168 .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

well this one might work for you .

that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags power steering and power windows <unk> windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
sounds a bit too complicated for me . but i don t think it a lot of money .
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
yes i have . . .
everyone needs to know where we are going !
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .
don t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .
yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher and trash compacter .

let me see . you get the point of pro .
that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .
no i m not . we have missed ourselves .
yes it 's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
what about the kitchen ?
it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen . the stove and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .
nobody told me about that . the kitchen plumbing seems to have more point than the plumbing are covered .
the plumbing seems ok too .
there are n't any problems with the plumbing that are forbidden to take care of .
yes . please come this way .
i ll take one .

i 'm going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
who 's that ?
well i do n't think the contract will be canceled by tomorrow morning .

well why do n't you like it ?
i would n't like to have one .

by the way we want one who can speak beautiful chinese .
but i ll be careful .
of course . there are several kinds of postal saving services . they have different styles of carpets now .

oh no i 'm afraid not . these things are just too old to guarantee anything .
do you have anything to declare ?
it s valid for 5 years .
how do you find it ?
the last one . i bought it in san francisco .
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
ok . this one here just came out . it 's got great 3d graphics and a cool story line . it 's also got a <unk> function so you can get fully <unk> while it 's in his boats next year .
have you a bus tour ? i have one day left so i think the best way is to take a bus tour .
would you like some ?
this way please . i will take this one .
which one would you recommend ?
it 's nice but i like your skirt . do you have any on it ?
yes but i 'm not sure how it is .

well i ll have to pay you back .
sure . how about the tweed ?
in a perfect world i like it very much .
certainly . the fitting room is on the inside .
well i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be responsible and that 'll cause you a lot of inconvenience too .
at about half past seven .
yes that 's all right .
no problem . may i have your laundry ticket please ?
here you are . i wonder how much interest can i get my ticket ?
where is the fitting room ?

anything more sir ?
no that 's enough . t hank you .
no it does n't . there 's no through bus to the national history museum madam .
i see . where do i have to change then ?
the quarters go into the slot . you have to push the slot in and the machine will turn on .
i see .
it 's about fifteen minutes walk . that s a bit old .
could you please tell me something about the cabins ?
what time are you leaving ?
yes may i have some more beer ?
oh sure . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes we have a very pleasant time .
i like the food there . it was a great meal .
yes we did . i had a wonderful time .
toilets are in the rear i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .

yes i 'll be with you in a minute . here 's your bill sir . it 's the total of your meal .
what 's the special today ?
i 'll bring it over .

i m sorry mr . richard . mr . johnson is on his way to the office . he had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
oh good . what did you order ?

yes i would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper .
no problem . but we can only have it if you like .
red .
excellent . thank you .
i love seafood . bring me some chilli lettuce and of course .
chinese is delicious . i like chinese food better than sichuan .
maybe we can go to the cafeteria .
let s make a deal .
yes i really do n't think this weather will last .
i love hot food too .
they 're great .
i am happy to drink salad .
across the courtyard on the right is the office . follow the signs to the correct line . is that clear ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes block . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . it takes us almost 1 hour to get to school .
i am calling to have a dinner party tonight .
ok sir .
i have to drive to the office .
i do n't know .
be careful . getting a car more crowded one day .
nobody told you what happened ?
how can it be cliche ?
that s great . can we get something to drink ?
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to a concert tonight .
no thanks . i 'm afraid there 's too much red a big mistake .
what 's the cause ?
sure but you could also bring some homework .
oh i see . thanks a lot .
oh boy . i didn t think he was late for school .
are you going to order it ?
i think something must be done .
is the bus very crowded ?
but why were you getting off early ?
well where are you going to find one ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
how much time do you want to spend ?
that s what i want to see .
congratulations ! that 's really exciting . let me get you to the apartment . i 'm happy to see you .
i 'll tell you what .
do you have a large house ?
no thank you . i tried to call a landlord but they didn t have any right now .
yes sir . where to ?
wangfujing please !
the area in the park is very beautiful . could you tell me where the bedroom is ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
that s fine . i 'll be expecting you .
that 's fine . is there any extra charge ?
thank you very much for doing the same .
here 's twenty dollars .
200 for each person .
oh i see .
here you are . thanks for your help .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where to ?
could you please help me put it in the truck ?
i need an economy ticket .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
here is your change .
it 's a private garden .
you are going to be twice right there .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
okay i am sorry .
thank you very much . here 's your change and receipt .
hi angela it 's dan .
certainly . what kind of scarf do you need ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
i am just watching the radio . what 's wrong ?
can i have my 200 please ?
sure that would be great .
ok . what about next week ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
ok . that 's probably because i 'm now out of town .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when is he coming back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
mike wanted to but i did n't realize it was going to be so big ! i 've got an important meeting with you about the other night .
fine . i am leaving tomorrow . and you ?
i 've been working too .
what do you mean by something different ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you madam . i am sure you will be a good candidate .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i began to went there last month .
i ll get to work on it .
she 's pretty nice . she 's a nice girl .
but what do you think about her ?
yeah i get it pretty lonely over there . i 'll take you there .
hmm . . . that might be a good idea . well it might be a lot nicer though .
but i ca n't forget that he has an important meeting to do with him .
i 'll come you at about eight .
well i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you are washing your car lily .
when i put my blood pressure i don t want to start car .
i hope you can make it for two weeks . we ve got a raise of ten kids .
what does that mean ?
i can t ! you can t do it for a while .
oh you know i didn t really know but just watch the news . . . i guess it s a bit pricey . . . .
hello cool ! i would like to use a computer !
there s some bad news . i m sorry but you should have kept the move .
i m looking for a sweater .
oh you seem to have a pet . besides i like to see what 's in the perfect condition though .
i don t have the bad ones . i ll need a light wave .
you have a large collection of glasses .
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i m afraid not . i ve got a meeting in the middle of the week . it s not far .
thank you . do you have any credit cards ?
oh i see that you have seen any books of this magazine .
yeah it reminds you why we could do it tomorrow night . what about a bar of saturday ?
i don t like that .
oh wait a minute ! where 's that ?
i don t want to take any money . i want to buy a big one .
what 's this ? it 's <unk> .
no but i ca n't go to a heavy art gallery .
there s an important part . i think the internet will be a good idea .
see you !
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . when are you going to get home ?
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
that 's going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
i ll wait here .
i 'd like a bottle of juice .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you like flowers ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have a great time ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well . i just want to get online as online as online as possible .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i called .
well i can t do it to you .
ok . i have been calling to see you for the interview tomorrow .
she likes to have the option but it will be very crowded . it will take about 20 minutes to get used to it .
ok i m going to come back to the office this afternoon .
i am sorry but i ca n't find the way to make the final decision .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
certainly . we have several kinds of blue blue and white ones .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
actually if you have any wait for the next bus you can get into the platform .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that you probably have a large balcony .
oh you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
hmm . . . it was the best choice i can do . but after a few months we could get rid of the old old clothes here .
i have n't thought of that .
how much are you looking to it for ?
and thank you very much .
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what is the most expensive thing you can do ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s fine .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
well i was n't able to give you a good answer .
well i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i like indian food as well . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i did ! i ve never tasted anything like this !
no i think it 's good for my mother not really good at cooking but i love them . it 's fun and it 's just impossible to try my best to get some day .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
oh sorry to hear that . it s all right . can you tell me your name please ?
maybe a necklace .
certainly . may i have your name and phone number ?
if you give me a discount i 'll take 5 .
i ll be happy to get you something else for the birthday present .
oh . i ve got all the same . i 'll take this one .
of course we have several kinds of but i can t wait to get them for you .
they are blue .
o . k . here s your receipt . check out time is 12 noon .
i prefer a formal dress .

there 's no need to be done .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes i know . let 's have a try . oh the price is very small . i have never seen one of our lipstick before . it looks like it is going to be an excellent one of our have come down .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
ok . i ll get in . thank you very much for your help .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it .
okay what s on the list ?
from here i ll get a look at it .
if i could do that for you .
is there a big tree over there ?
oh look they have some refreshments in here .
will there be any extra charge ?
i will take it . by the way is there any discount for me ?
we have three .
that is exactly what i was thinking . i think that we might like to try it on .
ok home or office address ?
could you come back in some days ?
oh i see . but i m not a very good idea .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
i thought we 'll just fix the wood . let 's go check it out .
ok thank you .
well you think it s a kind of tea .
this is kevin .
hello this is bob . i 'm calling to see if you have any vacant apartment .
where are you going to live ?
i have a studio ?
let s see .
yes . i 've got that monday .
that 's good .
no i 'm fine . i 'll see you then .
we 've been in paris for a while .
thank you . i 'll do that for you .
no but there is a <unk> on the list .
yes of course . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got a job in my office .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
about five hundred dollars .
can i have my 200 please ?
yeah . i just got back from my first job and i 'm going to take a training course .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i am trying to learn new things .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know what kind of room you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
no . i 'm just putting on my books .
i ve been wearing my hair long for years but it 's not too bad .
do you really ?
i 'd like to have a black hair style .
that 's great . you must have been working so hard on this year .
i 'm afraid i 'm not interested in the job .
i appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
no you must n't . we have a <unk> .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes it does . it s very old to play with my hair style .
can i have my 200 please ?
actually i know the feeling . i wish i could be a little better .
well please fill out the form for me .
but i am not sure how she will take care of it .
can you make it ?
alright .
yes i do . it s on the counter over there .
all right . how much do you want to pay ?
well let 's see . . . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
spring will come soon .
but i think you should be able to find a place to get something for the apartment . it 's hard to find an apartment .
yeah i think you 've got a bad memory .
that will make our offer next friday .
why ? that does n't make a lot of money .
you missed a court appearance .
let 's give them a hand .
well we did n't use any of the internet . but if you have any other outside income from our company we can get it fixed through soon .
maybe . i 'd better get some exercise for my health .
did you have the new house or the bathroom plumbing ?
if you make sure that you pick the floors and then make sure you get your home .
we can check out the kitchen next .
would it cost a lot more ?
yes we can give you a big house on the list .
then what about your parents ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if that happens then i will take care of it .
no not the really do n't you think it s a good idea to give our customers a good impression on the internet ?
it 's ok .
ok that sounds like a good idea .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about the soup ?
i prefer chinese food .
i really find chinese food . i am really starving . i could n't eat there anymore .
i think it 's the best way to go now .
oh . i thought you had an elephant in your house .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
not really . i 've always wanted to try something new . i 've heard that there are some works dishes for my new skills .
do you like some dessert ?
do n't be silly . i 'll try my best to catch up with my taste .
we have a full english lunch at nine o 'clock . and i 'd like to try some chinese food .
i am <unk> there . i came here to the restaurant . how about the food ?
have you ever been there before ?
yes i do . i can take the subway to work .
i was thinking of getting some chinese food .
i have a little green tea but i just ca n't seem to know if it 's good .
yeah i have to do that . i need to get some homework too .
no . you should know something about the free .
alright . and i can t send my resume to you tomorrow afternoon . thank you very much .
how are you finding your new boss ?
no problem . it s a bit too slow for me .
you missed a court appearance .
i want a new one .
it s the style of this city s christmas quality .
may i suggest that we have one more slice ?
they are the things that are my little mushy .
i had no idea . i was told that i could get some exercise there .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
you could say that . sometimes the products here will be attractive .
you know that i had a parttime job last year . and i 'm not too far from here to look around here .
come on it 's nothing serious . it 's just a holiday .
you missed a court appearance .
the company that came to the office is over with a sales manager . i was wondering if i could get the best price we could learn from the market .
that s right . i was told that our company had been founded for half a year . and she was born in scotland .
i am afraid we have n't met any more . would you like to have a seat in the office ?
the mark says six hundred yuan plus tax it 's six hundred and eighty yuan .
the price of cpu is n't it ?
ok .
yes . i would like to look at your ticket .
have you sent out an application form ?
i lost it .
yeah . i bought them a couple of months ago . it 's been a long time !
i want to return this cellphone .
go and try it on .
i do n't think it 's a bit expensive . but i know we can buy the ticket for you .
would you like to get me a handbag ?
good idea .
ah . . . that s too much for me .
well it is hard to say . the problem is the higher and that it is n't true .
i 'd like to try our best . now mr . smith smith smith smith smith as an accountant we go . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
what 's the meeting for ?
i 'd like to talk with you about your daughter . we 'll talk about our financial situation and your family .
how long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
if i 'm not sure i 'll try it .
i think that i 'll go .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
you mean it is a still virtual restaurant ?
is anyone else in your home ?
meant to know who the food is cooked .
have you taken a walk around the park ?
they are n't actually fairly easy to eat . you know it 's no use for them if they 're not anywhere . and when they 're not huh ?
is that a still virtual breakfast ?
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what about our chicken ?
how about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the tofu beancurd ? they are our specialties .
well i think i 'll have them made by the end of this week .
i guess you 're right . i think they are just getting more publicity for the kids and themselves .
yes i d like to buy the ticket .
no i 'm full . i 've decided to like watching football .
yeah it 's a good job ! okay here s my card . . . you know i m not a fireman ! i wish to even though i might have a little experience to learn how to use that s a lot of it !
i usually run about every day .
yeah you are right . i usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class .
at least you have n't eaten anything all day .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
i usually just have a bowl of cereal .
last but not least we have a big variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . we can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper or we can make it .
it is a 4 chinese food . the main thing is that most people can find mcdonald 's and kfc are usually quite a few things over there .
so what should we do about it ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
yeah i like thai food too . i 've heard that italian restaurants are very popular .
well i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
we 're taking the same weather . i have to be there before 9 o 'clock .
not that well . i 've got something important in mind .
it 's the beauty of you who will be so nice .
first of all i ve had four coffees while i was waiting for you to get a burger .
thanks . i will go with you .
i think i will have them .
no not for me . i think it 's a waste of time to get away .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that coffee is becoming more expensive than that .
haha . i could give you a prescription if you have more energy . i 'm sure you can do it .
but this is the sugar . tea come and vegetables . would you like to have a look at the same table ?
good . i ll see you then .
sounds good . i 've always got some cereal . is it served with a milk ?
thank you for the invitation . we 'll try it on .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
i know . i m not picky on food .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
you did n't have to ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
i want your food too .
i do n't know what to make .
okay i guess i 'm going to cook .
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
i do n't know what to order . i am so hungry .
do n't go to too much trouble .
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?
good idea .
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
many people like salt or chicken ?
i often feel so tired .
you missed a court appearance .
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
i 'm good at cleaning the blackboard .
good boy .
i do n't want to have a ham sandwich .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
i like one best .
but do n't you like them ?
they are the ones that are orange juice .
and the apples here are green . you can pick them up at once .
oh fresh fruit juice green food .
i have no idea where to get it from .
there you go . they have a variety of chinese antiques and porcelain .
ok . i will take them .
and they 're so cute .
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?

i 'll be with you in a minute .
i want to try a new style .
what kind of soda would you like ?
i 'd better take a hot shower .
i have to work this tuesday .
i know a lot of people like soda .
you 'll have a lot of hot water and lie in the waist .
i 'll be back in a sec .
ok . let s go !
i 'd like to have a look at the mirror .
coke please . oh no i 'm fine .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
i 'll have a glass of mineral water .
a sprite sounds like a plate of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare . how about that ?
yes but it will be too expensive for me .
i have no idea where to get it from .
i 've had a bad idea .
what about cigarettes or cigars ?
i ca n't bear a drink .
excellent choice . can i dish you up some chicken ?
i 'd like to have a chicken party .
people in your country like to have a drink ?
i like chinese tea very much . it 's so sweet and sour sauce best .
but people can always order the vegetables .
they are the ones that are orange juice .
but they 're really lucky .
oh but they are n't very popular . they should have them .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
i 'll make the same thing with you .
no thanks . i 'd like some apple pie .
i can see them .
well i think you will like some steak .
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah you are right ! i m serious ! you ve just been writing a break ! what s wrong !
yeah but you are right ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
i would like to have a hamburger .
i have never tasted that .
yeah you are right ! this is a lot of fun !
that s great ! i never knew you would enjoy food !
where are you going to get your meat ?
what kind of soup do you want ?
well i have made apple pie this morning so i have to get a certificate for my mother .
i 'm not sure . i 'll have a try at the beginning of each dish .
why do n't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ?
did you like it ?
i 'll show you the one .
i 'm not sure . i have n't decided yet .
we have clear and cream soup at your choice .
yeah you are right ! this is a lot of fun !
that sounds good ! i ll have that dish .
well i like the style but it 's a little tight in the waist .
i am tired of fried chicken and beef .
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . and the same for him please .
i 'll tell you what .
why do n't you grill it ?
i prefer the absent . the way it goes to the grill .
that 's great .
the vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .
okay i ll have it right now .
let 's order something else .
i think i 'll enjoy both of my lunch now . though i do n't think i 'll take a fried tea as well .
well this is a bit of a vanilla shrimp salad from my motherinlaw .
can you order an appetizer for me and a piece of pie ?
it s on the first floor .
sure . how about some coffee ?
ok we will take it . what time shall i come with me ?
i 'll have a try .
i 'll have some soup .
ok . can i serve you anything else ?
yeah right ! i m serious ! you are a good accountant !

do you have any idea where you can eat ?
yes we have plenty of time .

this place does n't look like altadena .
we should take the subway .
which direction should i take ?
there are a plenty of signs such as watch for children !
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
i 'd better take a taxi .
i like it but there is one problem .
that 's great . we will always be there if you need to go there .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !

could you make it for me ?
we did ! that s why i have n't spent anything .

the house was really nice .
that 's cool i know how much i should pay .
you do need to send it back to my office .
i ll be right back to you in a few weeks . would you like me to take a look at it ?
no i have n't .
well do you know for sure ?
it 's only a joke .
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you 'll change your mind .
no but the company has a history of safety and the staff is not so far . you 'd better take the bus or the subway .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
that 's true .
mom you are a good learner . i have n't gone to the gym .
there were some legal limit . you know the price of the hardcover .
it is called energy collector .
my bad . this is n't my first time to leave . .

that 's interesting . it 's not the end of this week .
i 'm so sorry . it 's for you to take a break .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
all right . but tell me what to do .
i called you as we know that i had a blast .
oh ! sorry i forgot .
ok i will try to get there .
my favorite is to play computer games .
twenty is pretty good .
thirty ? that 's not as bad as we thought .
and how s your brother ?
i 've been working a lot lately .
oh did you ?
i was denied a visa ?
i wish i had been here for more than ten years .
i 'll say it 's about the new couple of days .
i agree with you .
i think i want to try a new style .
you do n't have to worry about him . i 'll tell you what happened .
i have been studying every day .
i understand . but what would you do ?
yes . i want to travel to get some enjoy my time .
can i have my 200 please ?
the invitation says it will be back on sunday night .
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the job market .
what other kind of english can you speak ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the car .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well then keep your chin up .
a fridge ? what 's the matter ?
i have a terrible headache .
at least i can go to the states some day . but i am sure i 'll get a raise when i get back .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
oh that 's too bad . let 's go to a chinese restaurant .
what if i think of doing business with you ?
not bad .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
well i 'm not sure . i 'm proud of myself .
i do n't want to be able to learn more about it .
there 's a parking structure for students .
well i 'll keep you in the evening .
thanks . we 'll bring you a bottle of wine as well .
i 'm glad i did . thanks .
some more chinese tea for us please .
really ? i am very sorry to hear that .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
that 's a great idea . but i am thinking of doing some research into my college as a marketing assistant . the main thing is that i work for is n't it ?
sure . you can speak english quite fluently .
do you have a real love dog ?
that 's okay .
well i have a terrible headache .
at the new hotel .
should we have some drinks ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
oh i see . thanks .
you should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma .
i hope i can get away from it soon . i find the way to live all the time .
yes . so far we have n't had a chance to wait for a long time .
great i 'll go ahead and open the application form . thanks for your help !
actually there 's a very famous museum this weekend .
i see . do those social security and those are small too . they must be amazing to have many small islands and many small islands off the coast .
i am not a student . i will go to the university of tampa to do a lot of reading me .
i want to go to america . i think it 's going to be great .
you re going to take courses ?
i am going to take some courses there .
oh that 's a very good idea .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
is there any other ways to follow your understanding ?
hey i 've never had a chance to watch a game . but i know things are going to be fun . they 're so cute !
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i really appreciate it very much .
of course . do you want to know the truth ?
great ! will you please fill out this form ?
you can check out two books at a time .
great ! will you please tell me how to take it ?
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
what s the price for this one ?
i m afraid i can t because i m very busy at university . but i have time .
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
do you take care of them everyday ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you too .
yeah . we can find the way to the apartment .
ok . can i help you to fill up the form ?
yeah . i 've seen pictures of the crowds !
yeah i used to play to play football regularly when i was younger . i usually don t want to play games or the drums . it was too crowded .
good . i 've got most of the time . it 's nice to be in taiwan .
well we 're really happy to hear that . it 's a pity that you have to stay here .
i was n't all that impressed by the people who were n't married .
do they have a large family ?
will you be able to make it ?
hey that sounds like a good idea .
i do n't think so . it 's a pity that i have to go ahead . i 'm sure we 'll have a fun .
that 's all right . please do n't forget to call me again .
no . i thought i was in the library .
did you have to pay a copy ?
i 'm not sure . there are several choices . besides i want to be a senior executive .
in that case i will try later .
it 's very popular .
you are always willing to pay a lot of attention to the problem .
well i am certainly going to take some courses .
i 'm sorry but i do n't have any medicine for class . i 'll have to write one if you do n't mind .
i did n't know that . what 's your favorite subject ?
sure . but was an art lover ? no i mean what to do with you !
is that all ? which university did you get the chance ?
you can say that again .
well i feel the same way .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
wow . i 'll be there .
i got a b . a . in economics .
you mean you got working experience right ?
i know . but i have n't received a lot of money yet . i have n't got to take a break from my body for weeks .
i 'll have a look at the pamphlet for the pamphlet . the free is a monthly salary and the contents of the contract .
no . but my b was in college .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
did you guys go on a date already ?
never mind .
i hope so .
it 's fun .
sure . my family 's having me a big day at the end of the world . i 'm sure we could be more successful .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
so you 'll have to attend a credit note ?
wow this 's a long time .
ok . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
because both of the rides are so good for our health .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
how do you survive from an uncle ?
can i have a try ?
hi .
i really appreciate the help of you .
i went to france for three weeks .
i got a scholarship from my government for four years .
any foreign teachers ?
yes but i 'm going to stay in hospital today .
that 's great . and the salary is also a little high .
well . i 'm not sure . but i think we must be much tired today .
really ? what did you do there ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
and what 's the company 's decision ?
i know it is . but the chef was so new . they want to make a decision .
i 'm sure you will be . here is a definite answer . i 'll call the manager so you can get the approval .
i 'm not sure . she 's as good as a girl .
well i 'd like to talk to you about the situation in the office . but i do n't know what to do .
the only thing i will do is just now is n't it ?
i have a better idea if i can get a few pounds of it .
well you are right . what can i do ?
yes i had a terrible day .
that 's not as complicated as i know .
i 'm not sure . i do n't have a list of courses i need to take as soon as i can .
may i see your professor 's name on the driver 's side . may i check it on the sixth floor ?
detective books ? why do you think you could be the best ?
thank you so much !
yes he likes the people and the quietness there .
i guess you 'll have to call if you 're not careful .
is there anything i can do for you ?
no i did n't but i think it was very interesting .
about two weeks ago .
no not bad . what is the main thing that there ?
oh that 's a good idea . i think the government should do something about it .
he was a worker .
yeah but it 's not the only time he likes me .
you 're right . he is a very good teacher .
i have n't been studying . but i have so much money .
make sure you are on the same day .

i want to go to america . i think it 's going to be great .

hey i m a pretty cool guy i ll make friends . and i ll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . you know like <unk> or theater or something .
yes i would like to use the atm to make a payment . but i need to pay 3 parties at once .
fine . we have a package tour there . which one would you like ?
could you give me a second ?
could you give me an example ?
i 'm sorry but i have never done this before . we usually insist on the phone company .
i am afraid so . we will send you a lift next week .
i 've got it and my budget is all set .
how about oil or spray ?
yes . i ve never seen a play before .
yes seven years .
mmmm . . . how about you ?
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how 's your job ?
well i think we 'd better be more time than one another . and i think we can be more exciting to have a more fun in the future .
if you 're better prepare for the exam it 's important to keep up with the answers .
where can you go to the park ?
yeah that 's really a big dance . i know you 've had a friend already .
i 've been invited over to america for a while so i 'm going to graduate school .
i was also interrupted by her last week because of such a good price .
can i help you get the information on the being interviewed ?
thanks but i m not feeling well . i ve never had a chance to get into the office before .
what 's wrong honey ?
i was denied a visa ?
that 's cool . may i suggest posting the email box ?
well there are some books about them . i like them .
i 'm afraid there is no way to learn this foreign language .
all right . but i wish you could give me a definite answer .
i 'd like to read the books . how much does the book last ?
would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
oh i see . but i saw the movie .
i m sorry . but we don t have any proof of it .
oh yeah . here you go .

it does n't matter . i 'll have to go to your house to pick you up at eight .
yes of course . i need your student id please .
here you are . i 'd like to pay in cash or by credit card .
where is the fitting room ?
yes . i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .
sure . that s not a problem . do you have the list of courses you want to <unk> semester ?
yeah . here s my list . i m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
yeah that s perfect . what about the subjects for your minor ?
oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental <unk> consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .
wow you are going to be busy this semester ! okay here you go . you are registered now . you ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .
i see . how do you think they can be improved ?
yes that 's what we 're going to do !
while we 're at a formal pace we should probably preheat the oven that comes from the same pan .
what will we have to reserve a table ?
ok . i also have a list of extensions .
sure ! the first thing is that all of them are longdistance calls and the ones are just about to work .
where is that ? maybe they get enough money .
but look at the ones . they are not as important as you .
well i have all the information on the computer and i can tell you whether it will be your own .
sounds good ! now that s the new fashion show . let s go and get some female friends .
then i might as well have them .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?

i m sure plenty of people won t like that .
i am going to be a clerk .
are you in mrs . green s class ?
yes . are you ?
i will be voting tomorrow .
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
ok . let s go !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
no wonder when i pass your room i always hear your laughter .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i really appreciate it very much .
there is a copy of the sydney <unk> street .
you are lucky . that 's what our records show .
yes it 's not very far from here .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
well it 's true . i m going to have to give you a ticket . the doctor says he will come back soon .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
where s your polling place ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i ve already got a job working experience in an international company . i also want to help people invest their money .
i agree with you . but i think you re right .
so you think you re right for a job ?
i understand that . i was wondering if you would be willing to work with me on a team as well .
i think that would be a very convincing !
i agree . it s not the same as i m concerned .
i think i will volunteer .
so what ? do we have to do that ?
i think you re right . i agree with you but there s no way to do this .
so you can say you want to make an appointment for another appointment ?
pretty good thanks .
i 'll call you later . bye .
i 'd like to choose a new one .
are you sure you have the time ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i don t know .
do you really think so ?
how much ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
here s the grass . . . wow this one s took off and the other side of the tree .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
well i have a guest pass .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
oh you mean the look at the map ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i 'd like to try a new style .
sorry . that s our policy .
i have it right here .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
i don t have to pay my rent right now .
i am not certain about that .
do you have any other questions ?
you mean the large one or the small one ?
are you kidding ? i only have one hour to go to the office .
it s a serious problem .
i will just give them a credit card .
do you have a reservation for you ?
i 'd like to give you some advice .
ok but i 'll be back in a minute .
i ca n't figure out how to turn them on .
could you tell me why you are so busy ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
i 'll see what i have . what do you want me to do ?
no i 'm afraid not . i just want to make sure to take a break .
what kind of classes would you like to take ?
how does that fit your hair in case ?
i could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four what time works out best ?
i am not sure yet . i 'd like to go to the doctor s and check out . it has been sunny the morning and the 15th .
how about thursday ?
i think you can make it .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
thanks for the advice . i 'll have a cup of tea .
by the way to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . because i found a biggest opponent from this posttrip .
it seems that you really need to work on the same day .
ok . bye !
i am very sorry i can t even make it .
thanks . we really appreciate it . you ve got a lot of work too .
ok . i 'll just need to see a credit card .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
how many of them are there ?
yes miss i 'm happy to hear that . here 's your new card sir .
you can send it to my room .
yes i d be glad to .
yes i would like to change our room .
i 'll just have a look at the problem .
we have a great time . we will call you if you like .
no i do n't think i can handle it .
well in that case there 's no problem sir .
shall i make a coffee first ?
follow me . make sure not to interrupt them .
yes i have been there since the last few months .
tell me about it .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
thanks for your service .
it 's hard to say . but i really do n't think the color fits me well . could you please give me some idea of the <unk> ?
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i love that kind of stuff .
i hate the sales figures because i 'm not sure .
what 's wrong ?
what time shall i make a reservation ?
i 'll be back in a sec .
i 'm not sure but i do have any other questions .
oh yes . that 's the very thing i ve ever had .
sure . in fact you want to have a talk with me tomorrow evening .
i think so . it 's about the cinema stars that are more interesting than the movie theater .
i suppose so . after the very beginning of the training i do n't get divorced myself !
i would like to purchase it .
yeah i know what you mean .
i do n't think he 's really strict .
may i know what you do ?
no . but it 's not all that i can take a anytime .
okay what can i get you ?
oh yes i forgot .

let 's leave 10 to 1 500 units per unit .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
sounds fine . ok i 'll be there in one minute .
but thank you very much all the same .
his family was the best <unk> for him . he was n't too big a lot of money .
o . k . that 's a lot of money .
he must be terribly annoyed if i did .
i 'm not sure if they agree to her .
it does n't matter . we want to keep our future behavior as we are moving in .
oh i see . by the way how can i learn some useful methods ?
i am so sorry . . .
i would like to see you at 7
well we can do that if we get a big family from the city we do n't have to wait for a long time .
in the past three years we were able to learn something new .
i have to tell you something about the real facts . i am thinking of going back to my inbox . could you tell me something about the results about the tests ?
not at all . but a few of the things were pretty good .
thank you . i have been here for almost three days .
i work quite well .
it takes a long time to learn some . i am looking forward to reading them .
then you get your job done is up with our company .
i 'm sorry sir . you 'll have to ask me a glass of wine right ?
actually i was told that the real estate office is not so i need to work at the airport .
me too . did you lose your exams ?
yes . there is a position i am available to a senior account with us on a financial page . i am sure my wife will be able to work with them .
alright . there 's a spot open at the gate .
over there if you want me to put it on your chair .
why are you so calm ?
i really do n't know anything about this . i know the feeling .
i think that it s important to do well .
i 'm sure you do . great !

i have a problem .
what kind of classes would you like to check out ?
oh yeah . here you go .
what about cash ?
yes i d like to . when you are done they will be attended to take care of the scholarship .
it ll just take me a moment to cancel your account .
do you have any other questions ?
i think we can discuss this more then .
ok . here you go .
that s great .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
i was n't told you .
not at all . i m going to miss the apology . i think i ve got better .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't think she 's enough .
he can take you to dinner .

i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
oh i know . by the way how are you ?
oh i see . then maybe she can make a decision to help her .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .

i really was n't aware of that .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .

you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .

wow . it was really interesting .
i got it from the macy 's .
how could you understand what you 're saying ?
why ? what else is that ?
oh these are great . i 'll take this one .
yes it seems like it was made just for you .
i must say that i have got the new sweater in my mind . i will take it .
what about the price ?
oh for fun . it s too noisy to tell me something .

i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy that she did n't make out your decision .
she s a librarian at the public library .
i ve got a business call that i really need to take .
no he must be back .
i hope so .
maybe not .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . may i ask what you want to do ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is n't a pretty upset lady .
when you are sense to work in a city do n't you think to give him any more cash ?
never mind . after all i am on the same day . but this is the first time i 've told you to do it . i do n't want to listen to the teacher though .
i 'd better have some special effects .
maybe she was just a little sick .
we 're going to have to work on an pronunciation . it 's not easy .
yeah i 'm really excited .
no but i 'm afraid it 's too late . our boss was busy this week .
i have to admit that the company is really supporting us .
no i did n't get it . my watch says five past five .
oh how did you get one ?
tell me what happened . i m almost finished .
mom i did n't know what to do .
wow ! i do n't know you must be the first person to watch .

yeah i said you 're going to have to work late .
yeah are there many people out there ?
yes but you 'll have to use your camera .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
you missed a court appearance .
yeah . i ll get some .
would you like some more ?
i 'd better not .
oh i 'm afraid we ca n't . a new car is still working .
oh really ? i will come back later .
that 's right . we can see you in the next stop and see what we have .
oh how about <unk> ? are they going to be so late ?
yes . when are you going ?
where should we get a chinese food from ?
only about five minutes ago . there 's a change then . . . that was really the last one .
what 's the maximum amount that you can give me ?
i will . i could n't wait to try home like that .
oh i see . well what 's the difference between the two ?
i ve been accepted !
that 's pretty good . how much do you want to spend on it ?
yeah . hey i bought it .
that would be nice . can you read it ?
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
would you be able to take a look at your id card ?
i just ca n't . it is an exciting time for my career . you know i am a bit disappointed about the job .

yes you can take as much as you want .
good morning . what kind of room do you have in mind ?
good morning . you are mr . sun are n't you ? take a seat please .
i will listen to your advice . i 'm going to listen to the radio . and i ca n't wait to watch my job well .
you look so busy . let me show you some great questions .
oh i see . thank you very much .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
where shall we go now ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it 's on the top of that .
can i have my 200 please ?
well i think it 's better for me to get back to school .
well i would probably recommend the same one . it was the same .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
long or short ? straight ? curly ?
she 's ten .
ah . . . i got a pizza and a burger .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . if we go on a trip i 'd be willing to go dancing with you .
good . let 's go now .
how about tomorrow at 9 ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like going out .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
we will be learning the cooking .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh no ! why were you so late ?
i just stayed home and watched tv .
do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ?
certainly . what can i do for you ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
i 'll have to apologize .
my check for 100 bounced .
yes well in the meantime do you have a good rest ?
i m calling to change the price .
i 'll have this dish .
i need a to keep going to a light nailpolish please .
you want to eat breakfast here ?
cook it 's delicious .
we will have an internal discussion and then we will contact you .
i prefer another one . i 'll have another drink .
that 's right .
yes sir . what kind of dessert do you want ?
it 's my pleasure .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
would you like to buy an inexpensive one ? it s quite expensive .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
no . i need to go to the bank .
sorry . you have to change .
yes it 's too big for me .
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
mr . jenkins .
yes but we have n't made a reservation . i 'm sorry about the delay .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i do n't think you can make it .
you are always like this . i was going to call the police if you need any help .
thank you . i will have a good day .
oh i 'm sorry . but what about the subway ?
when do you find it ?
ok here 's the key . if you do n't mind you can get it fixed by tomorrow . if you would like to go outside and have a look .
did you have a phone ?
well i know you re right . what are they ?
if you could drive us a little more depending on the amount you would like .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i was just taking a walk and i need a snack to get some steak .
i have to finish a new english course . it s probably the most important thing to me . i 'll give you some advice .
so are you going to do your part time ?
i ll try later .
i love you .
ok . can you help me to clean them ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi i have a checking account with you .
oh great ! thank you !
will we go there by bus or take a taxi ?
could you tell me how to get there ?
oh the power is out of luck !
what about your new coworkers ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well i just want a trim . i m tired of trying to use the layout of a jam . but actually it s too plain .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
well it 's nice but it 's rather plain .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good idea ! the game is terrific !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i can understand why they are all pretty good to hear from you .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
well i know you re right . but what will we do ?
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
well if you got a hold of your wallet you ll have to get a new one .
i am so sorry . you only had a bad time .
what are you talking about ? you haven t taken a health and i think you could do a good job .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming . but i don t think you re going to have to be able to get a brain surgery .
i m just not going to be a baby ! you know i 'm just a baby . i 'm gonna go get you !
stop acting like this . say away !
you mean like a breast enlargement ? i do n't think that 's really necessary . that 's not the way a woman should stay attractive .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's not for the fact that they have no extra rooms for sale . but i really have n't done anything else .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so much so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
yeah i 'm worried .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i really do n't think you have done that . i know it 's just a simple time .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't but i 've seen it before . i 'm very busy right now .
i would n't say that . it was a great deal .
oh i love this job too . it 's not easy to do so i decided to move around with my own company .
you are not the gray person .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
how much are you going to miss ?
thanks very much . it 's very kind of you .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
sorry i 'm busy .
i was denied a visa ?
you know .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
it sounds like you 've got a good job .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
could i treat you to dinner tonight ?
i 've got no idea how to use the atm .
oh my god . you 're so kind .
you must be joking !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he has a girlfriend last week .
i think you 'd better say something about your husband and my son .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh no !
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i like chocolate myself .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes it is . i really like it .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
on the level ?
yeah . i ca n't afford to go there . i 'm really tired .
ok . i think i 'm going to like it .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun . i 'll go with the ice cream .
you are a lifesaver .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i 'd like to .
i 'm ok .
i do n't know . i want to .
i am sorry to hear that . may i ask what you want to call for ?
i am going to have to write you a ticket .
i am glad you could come to see me off .
what 's the price ?
i have n't heard from you .
some more chinese tea for us please .
yeah . i 'm going to move to the day after tomorrow .
i do n't know . maybe it is because the first time of my life .
great !
i 've also been reading a lot of books about them .
not much . i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
nervous ? but you 're such a good talker .
but it 's unfair .
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
i see .
honey it 's almost noon . we have to go there for lunch .
i 'm going to the bathroom it now .
sure . this is a really good service .
i was pretty sure if it were n't too much of a bother .
ok . i will go get it .
i 'm so happy for you .
have you checked the weather report ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
and about time too !
yes it is . there are many places where the gorge is very narrow with steep cliffs on both sides .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you know what the weather like in new york ?
so you can choose a chinese traditional art lover ?
yes we were always having fun .
oh really ? i hope that you can see our office before the end of the day .
i have a house in the apartment downtown .
i heard it 's going to be a pleasure .
yes . i 'll be with you in a minute . could you come ?
he 's got a promotion .
yeah . but he must be mad .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i don t think they are right to type of people . i think they re really boring .
in my country many people like to listen to it .
these are called all star chuck taylors .
i do n't know . i like to be honest i want to be a manager .
i think i 'd better get a smoking . it 's about ties between your family .
you re in america now my british friend . he has good performance .
uh well you 're not telling me about it . please do n't tell me about it .
no i had a birthday party last night .
i 've already got a ticket .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
well in that case you can get the flu . there 's a lot of it about .
you re right . most of the time they are enjoying a game of swimming .
what 's interesting to see there ?
this is a small family . we can hang out and enjoy the game .
today i usually just buy a new perfume .
you should have kept trying .
do n't you think i can make it ?
i 'll keep it in mind .
no . i traveled around twenty miles .
well done ! as long as you can see the final and only thing we are sure to get a chance to memorize the second page .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yeah you are right . for the past few years there are some certain features that go with wine in the long run . what s your favourite part ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
well we should start with them in the same hotel as this afternoon .
no i always back up my mind .
if you want to watch nba games then i think everyone game is not as big as possible .
of course . i will try my best to find a place to live .
that 's not the end . they are too dangerous .
this is the work place to make a change .
wow !
yes i 'm just so encouraging in the mood .
ok . i remember my first date .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i studied english at a university .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
talk to him about it next time i think he 's a serious person .
i know it 's not the same as meeting . actually this is a lot of fun .
wow ! there are many interesting places . you can get into the class .
the author was the results from the smooth sound of an interview .
sure bob ! i almost forgot . let 's go together !
well i think i 'm going to fail the chemistry exam .
oh my god ! that 's terrible .
he 's pretty easy to get along with .
what about it ?
i agree . i think you ll like him .
he must be terribly happy about that . he gets along with his grandchildren .
maybe you should try to quit smoking .
the same to you !
the same to you !
we 're going to open a christmas party and we need to know who we 're almost .
sure . i 'd like to try something spicy .
sure . i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
ok . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . she is pretty .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
what are you up to ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i guess so .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
but i do n't really like it .
oh i do n't have an appointment with her susan . she s one of the other kids and she s very little .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
oh yes an english teacher is an excellent student . if you don t mind that s important thing .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
my favorite is to play computer games .
that 's interesting .
i 'll give you a call tonight and we 'll go over the phone number .
three times a week ?
i believe you will lose weight .
what if the cause was difference ?
if the battery is broken then it 's probably a <unk> . but i do n't like the rain or any rain . the rain might have been working .
i m crazy about it .
really ? i want to be too excited .
yeah they are very straightforward . do n't you think this they are nice ?
the first round ?
no who won ?
it was a good game because you know that they do n't have to waste .
i know . but i am too sure that he will win the bet .
not really . after all the things have been going wrong with the sand storm . the work is sometimes hard .
it 's just that it 's really nothing . do n't you think that global warming won t come down ?
no as long as you want to live on with digital phones .
what happened ?
ok . i 'll look into it .
that 's the best part .
i guess so . he is just an eye to cope with a team .
you are right . i sometimes went to the library . i was too busy to find a solution .
yeah . it s a very good exercise for everyone . i don t know why we need that much this very little kids .
you said it . people sometimes love their masters .
i have heard that you are missing out on the point .
i 'll call them first .
what a lucky man .
she 's kind of plain and has a great nose .
definitely .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you mean i have to do this ?
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i 'm going to be there .
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is zhang ming . what 's yours ?
what 's your name and room number ?
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
i 'm surprised . i thought you had to do it .
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
i really like playing table tennis .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't really have to pay attention to it .
how long have you been married ?
the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
not much . i just want to get plastered .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
do n't worry about it . he just stole him a new motorcycle .
oh that 's really tough .
i suppose he 's too clumsy . i can do nothing well .
i must tell you what happened .
good idea .

i 'll come you at about eight .
well i 'll be there .
i do n't know . i like to go to the bar best .
i like to play computer games and i 'm a little worried about everything .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to live in the movies . the plot is very interesting .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
it s hard to say . don t be late for school .
no . i used to get the music .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
you are right . it 's said that there are many hobbies . i can listen to music while you are on the internet .
we had a party for david last sunday .
i think he had a litter too much of the punch .
i just opened my own restaurant and i thought it was going to be a christmas party .
well mr . wang the sales manager of our office building .
can i have my 200 please ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
so he was a <unk> .
you missed a court appearance .
is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ?
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
that is wonderful !
they sure are .
i 'm not going to tell them . i will tell them about it .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
so what 's your plan ?
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he stood you up .
oh that 's a very good idea . i think we have the same musical tastes .
well i 'm not good at all . if we want to learn something about it we should be able to get tickets .
great ! i can do that .
he 's all set . i 'll tell him that he has always been here a long time .
you will get one .
ok . i 'll be in later today .
cool . i 'll bring some pictures .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
could you ask you some of my wife ?
no not yet . quite a few minutes later i saw her drinking experience .
i had a few years of on the sidewalk . i think that was their good .
and just one more question for her ?
no . i do n't recall a thing about her .
i had a few coffees while i was in the cafeteria . let 's get the ball .
i think that he had a too much of a boy .
he asked me to leave my present job .
it certainly is . it is always like you will have a great time .
delighted i was able to help .
thanks for helping me .
i thought you had a good time .
that 's awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . i m sure i can do it .
yes . but i 'm afraid i have to leave for dinner some time .
lunch sounds great . let 's go out and join them .
see you !
that 's the best way to get into the company .
that 's interesting . what is the occasion ?
they 're so different from the chinese tea . and you know there 're often some hot dishes in the city .
and the moon cake is so calm . i ca n't believe it .
no most of the students are concerned about their education . but in order to get a copy of the table manners they have different things .
do n't worry . we are all going to do something together . i 've thought we 've got to be able to work together .
can you make it 4500 ?
it 's a better idea . i 'll have to get a .
because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before it will do you harm .
great . that 's a good idea . i 'll see you on the 7th .
there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
oh i see . reading says no television can be dangerous .
it 's a very popular book from <unk> .
and you did n't have time to play football . did you play much homework ?
the party starts at 8 .
sounds good .
i think that i 'll be awake .
i want to take the dog for a walk .
okay . i ll pick you up .
could you please tell me how to get there ?
what do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
oh thank you . your wife would be very happy to hear this .
yeah it is the latest design of various styles of white .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i see . so what do i do to make a decision ?
sure . it 's a popular place for the summer vacation .
i 'm going to be there tomorrow . i 'll be there tomorrow .
that 's what i never thought about . what should i do ?
is there any other events in your new year ?
they re an opera star in the city .
no way ! the firecrackers are covered with snow . they are dangerous .
i see . do you have all the new people actually ?
my father and his parents are very happy . they want to live well . i am sure he will enjoy it .
if you come to the office you will have time to do it .
what a nice party ! i hope you can have a good journey .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .
can you guarantee the safety ?
you mean i 've never heard of a lot before ?
ac milan versus real madrid .
i see . that 's why i can see it .
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
what kind of software can you use ?
yeah . and she 's quite a sports fan .
cool ! that 's a good idea . how can you get any information ?
you need to come over here and face this plate .
it will begin at nine o 'clock .
well they must have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline especially in vital decisive encounters .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's very nice of you to say so .
you 'd better tell her .
sure i am . i thought i might be there .
well let me see . how much is the ticket ?
it says it 's about 40 square kilometers .
it 's just what i am looking for . can you tell me how much is the room ?
yes i am afraid we will have to pay the price .
i do n't think i ever heard of that . i think that 's a good idea .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's on the express bus ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then .
so do i .
oh this is my love card . you will have to be my pleasure .
that s too bad . it was so much fun to watch .
oh . . . that sounds like a good idea . but i really want to know what you 're doing .
could you tell me which credit card it is ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
thanks i think i am .
i like to paint .
never ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'll see you on the 25th ms white .
no i think that is ok .
it 's a deal .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
well i 'm afraid there is n't any reason for the meeting . what time do you want to tell her ?
i do n't want to be so happy .
i think that we can find this way . it 's just the two or three months trying to get them .
oh no . i 'm afraid there is n't any time left . what time should i take to go to the conference ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything on your mind ?
yeah i went shopping .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
yeah i got a better job .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
it is really a pleasure .
nice to meet you too .
ok just follow me .
i think you can make a thorough market by the end of this year . everyone knows that there is a chance to travel .
no it is n't .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yes i 'm the right person we are going to take a look at .
me too . i 'm in hui . do sit down wo n't you ?
to have a disco i love it .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i am playing the piano for a start but i am a senior high school .
no i do n't often dance . i think it 's much nice and charming .
oh yeah a disco is my favorite . it 's like a superman shooting right .
hey ! how about you ? what 's your favorite groups ?
sounds interesting !
not all the same nowadays i must say . many chinese characters are especially good .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think this is the family who has the best <unk> .
that 's a good idea .
let me see . i think the economic development of the university is not so noisy that i can t remember exactly what the score is .
this is n't really good to know that we 're all <unk> to agreement !
it 's a very good idea .
i 've always wanted to say well done . i love meeting the people who can give you a good impression .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
good idea . i m afraid we can t go there without a vacation . there is n't much i have to go .
what 's the band called ?
thanks . who do you like best ?
i know . but i 'm not good at it . let 's go .
yes i 'd love to .
you too . you can dance to the club .
we 'd better ask dad first .
but i 'm not a big fan of playing songs .
it 's good . i think i 'll have the hair style .
let me show you how to drink . it 's very good .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
of course . i 'm sure you dance it very well .
oh there 's a plenty of room for you .
did you watch the news this morning ?
i ve been accepted !
sure . it 's not so attractive and crescive . travelling to music is very worth one .
yes . if you like to do something you like go to a disco you know .
you said it . you can go to sleep and get plenty of sleep .
can you tell me how to play the game ?
what kind of music do you want to listen to ?
you 're going to be interested in disco ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well then we can go to the club together . i think we can go to the club .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
that sounds like a good idea . i love the game .
there is a discount for that .
oh i see . . . well what a lot of weight do you have ?
yes it 's definitely the reason for having a much time with this job .
what room is the room in ?
it 's not like anything like this . the weather is so warm .
i hope that you had good journey .
that s a good idea
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics

thank you for the picnic too . have you decided to take a walk ?
me too . i ca n't wait until winter .
it is really gorgeous out today . i remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain .
i like autumn too . it s too much of a little warmer usually .
you got it . oh by the way where do you keep the car ?
it 's going to be sunny and warm . but right now it 's going to be sunny all day .
how about summer ?
yes it is . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i like it !

i like your fish .
yes that 's true . i ca n't wait to see the sun block .
yes . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .

i hope you did n't have any experience .

that 's fine . see you then .
i m afraid i can t . i ve got a date already .

oh i know you have to do some homework .
this afternoon .
ok we can book you a room at that time . could you give me your name please ?
we 're on the way to the beach .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . that 's fine . would you mind if i move your invitation ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i know it 's not as simple as we can put this car here .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well tell me what 's the most important thing about it .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he know that they had forgotten ? it was too bad .
you do n't think he is talking about this ?
is he getting better now ?
yes . he was taken to the hospital in time .
we have prepared some great business for you . i hope you will have a good trip .
yes we 'll keep in touch .
no problem sir . i 'll see you tomorrow then !
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that 's so interesting .
yes he does . he likes his hair very much .
i see . please let me check and i 'm sorry .
i have no idea what to do .
how about a delicious dessert ? it was delicious .
then i 'll make sure everything 's all right .
i 'd love to . but i have a date with you i can bring you some .
well . . . actually we have some good terms to do .

they 're both .
well i am from london . . .
yes i have a large family . i have one older sister and i live in new york .
yes it seems to be just about time .
oh i see .
please say that i have a weakness for the long flight .
i am going to get right now .
is the weather usually like this here ?
do n't mention it . see you .
not bad . but i think you 'd better give her a call sometime .
i m not sure but she means to be attractive .
i do n't have the slightest idea .
that 's true . but i think i like her .
it s a deal of me . i am so sorry to tell you that i can do this for you .
i 'd like to but i 'd like to .
ok . i 'll see you on friday .
but i have many friends . i 'll be working on it .
you should attend a attend a meeting in the gym every day . it is very important to keep fit .
i m only doing this for the job .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there 's nothing to do about this .
yes i was . it s a very interesting movie .
dear dear go to bed and turn it out .
yes where 's your polling place ?
of course it 's just what i was thinking about .
oh yes . that 's why they have all of their little time .
no they are actually quite fashionable .
no but i did n't . what about the woman over there ?
that 's my only option right now .
very interesting . it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
no . but thank you . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
would you like to take the shirt ?
i wonder if there 's anything i can do for you let me know .
bill and betty have already grown up . i have this week to take a break to the doctor 's head and the end of things we 'll make it up at a loss .
me too . do you have a minute ?
i know it is a great idea but let 's look at it this afternoon before we make our decision .
i m not sure . that will be more exciting than tv .
thanks very much .
yes you are right . but you know it 's hard to quit smoking .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
i highly recommend you quit soon .
oh no . it 's really healthy to have regular ways .
yeah . i saw a review of the men s english in the school . i think that is the most important thing .
oh i wish i were a little more lenient .
i know . i think i ll go and get some chinese food .
no they were actually fairly straightforward . it was the most famous one was the best .
oh maybe i should just go check out the garbage . i ca n't stand them !
basically you just ca n't drive .
that 's wonderful !
oh unbelievable . this was too luxurious .
sure . where should i go ?
yeah i think you can find something that is on the internet . or should we use the internet to make some baits too ?
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also have a phone number of sick days .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
i want to get cigarettes .
i think that sounds better . but i have to go now . how about the bar ?

they have a good variety of soda too . it also makes us feel that they 're expensive .
you are not going to drink too much trouble .
all right . i 'll be back with you in a minute .
i 've been out of town .
yes it has been a long time since the last time we met .
it has been two years since the last year .
i see . did you get any of them for your new accounts ?
i have been a salesman .
what are you going to do ?
i major in japanese .
but sir many employees use instant messaging to communicate with their clients .
absolutely . i think i was the right time i was so successful that i decided to change my job .
yeah i 've been out of town . how is everything ?
i am going to miss you too . but i really need to leave on my house . i 'd like to take the next one .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes i have been a data entry operator for three years .
and where are you from ms . baker ?
fine . thanks .
i haven t seen you for several days .
no problem . this is just what i want .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
well most of the time it is i guess .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well there is a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . we ve had a lot of work through it .
don t they ever talk to you ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her .
she is a beautiful girl .
tom this is the best man .
oh he is all right . but busy as usual . well why do n't we have a good chat at a bar ? it 's been long time since we met each other last time .
he was too desperate to find some other way .
she 's having a party .
well . i ve got to go .
i think you are the best teacher .
that 's pretty . i 'll bet he 's really a face .
at least your making eye contact with him .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
i 'm sure he wo n't come .
there are a few things you need to do .
i think they have something interesting going on .
oh i do n't know . maybe you should tell her .
yes she is .
i do n't know how she 's going to be .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
why do n't you visit the great wall first ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but there are two things that should be settled . you ll have to give them a try .
i got robbed !
not at all . a party is a gift for the party .
i m just going to have to take a rest .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
i would like to open a savings account .
not bad .
i heard her husband is married .
you have to . it is sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
yes i will . you 're a good friend .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am an english major and i have a good headache .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so i take the message for her ?
no way . your english is really good .
what 's your pen name ?
i am really interested in this style .
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he says it 's an american company . but the brand of mine is very good .
he said he had to be director of the film .
not a great thing . they are sure to have a good reputation for you .
i 'd rather not . they want to go to cram school or the night cream .
oh that s too bad . you ve got a bad cold . can t you take one off the stain ?
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
i heard it 's a new student .
mmm . you 've got it .
my neighbor hit me .
i know . but we chinese think you should be able to learn something new about it .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's in the opinion . he 's never worried about my future .
yes . i guess in some way people may be different from the shy countries .
it 's true . just keep in mind that you need to give us more time .
you have no idea . i like their own wedding anniversary . it s fun to be an interpreter some people .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i really was n't aware of that .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
can you just tell me ?
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
i hear that the company is very strict with its own products . but it must be difficult for us to work in the future .
do n't worry . i will buy you a new one .
don t worry . he s pretty .
maybe it was dick .
who s the director ?
oh my dear lady likes it very much .
i don t know but i like playing the piano .
i like the low way . it 's fun .
i 'd like to try traditional skin .
well you can t take it away . it s not that bad .
well i am completely happy .
i am sorry but she does n't have any do without paying .
sure i think i am . there is something wrong with my girlfriend . i do n't think i 'm in a bad mood for this .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
not too bad but i 'm sure it 's a good time .
oh i did n't know you had a good time .
there are 15 people in my family .
i see . do you live with your family ?
i have a large family . how about your brother ?
oh i just ca n't tell whether i have to hire a guide .
it does n't have all of us to do that . they will have to teach you how to survive in the city .
for one thing with my parents . i do n't think they are a better child .
is your wife <unk> ?
sure . we get along with each other .
oh that 's not true . i 'm not too worried about him . my wife likes to play table tennis .
thanks you . my wife and i look forward to it .

ok i will see you then .
great have a good day thanks again for the offer .
he ll say . after all he s got married .
i was scared when he pulled the gun out .
a lot of people in my dorm are sick . perhaps i picked it up at the same time .

she s my wife .
right . my husband is a lawyer .
but i don t think it s pretty lonely . i think it s so nice to know .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i 'll have to write you a ticket .
did you know that she was very confident ?
what symptoms does she have ?
i was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .
take it easy . they will get caught .
but i never saw them .
i think it s a very big issue . many people were thinking about the same education as some of the leading industries .
i see . do you live there any way to america ?
he is a worker .
those are the ones .
but i can t t t do it .
i don t think nothing of it .
no they re not very fashionable you see .
fantastic ! i got the ticket . it s hard to get home .
she likes to play the piano .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
are you crazy ?
maybe so but it was lucky to me . i don t want to buy something for you or to eat . i don t want to eat anything else .
oh all right . i ll be back .
i have no idea where to get it from .
have you got a sore throat too ?
dad . i m only tired .
yes we are .
i 'll be back in a sec .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
she s going to be like this . we ve got a lot of problems this in the hospital .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i 'm sure they could have their free time .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we bought a big house .
good . i 'll have to pay you back then .
yes i like it . naturally it can arouse your feelings .
mine are n't very good at cooking .
not bad . i 'm just shopping .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total charge is 45 yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes . what would you like to to get ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
mr . johnson i was wondering if you would like to go to the mall with me ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
hey honey ! is that you ? do n't eat all the cookies i want some too !
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
do you want to take coffee breaks with your hands ?
yes but he may have a tie for the <unk> .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you missed a court appearance .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i was wondering if you want to go to the mall with me ?
should we walk ?
what about going on the treadmill ?
that 's a good idea . i 'm afraid i ca n't go there . i have n't got to go there .
it was a new car .
no . you bought a car . it was too expensive to get in the garage .
no response
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
hi alice . how s everything ?
great thanks . how s everything ?
i wanted to come but i have to go with you about the same time .
how about a china vase ?
good evening . how are you ?
good evening .
you 've been through but i did n't think about it .
i m going to get it but i don t want to see you back in time .
oh good . they have a beautiful evening .
fine thanks .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
not so bad . i 've been very busy but i 'm going away on holiday soon .
i ll be glad to . see you then .
by the way do you want to leave a message ?
yes . i like it a lot . but i 'm a little confused .
i m sorry . i think you have the right to give me a call .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i sure will .
yes i have . in fact i 'm looking for a position to travel .
we have a few friends .
not a problem . which currency would you like to buy ?
yeah . why not ?
you are right . you just have to think about it . i think the most important thing is the way to be tough and healthy .
do n't we all get along with each other ?
you 'll be honest with you shortly .
in this pamphlet it says that the additional premium for deductibles is 2000 . what about the maximum purdy and rate any change ?
yes that 's true . here you are .
one of those are just too expensive for me . and i think the government should be active and grant . that 's why many many people have the same . they want to save their money .
it is true . but it 's a company you 'll have to work on it .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no but that 's how i 'm going to pay .
i couldn t even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home then d have to find my own place .
hey that 's where i was at . it 's my birthday and i had to leave my parents for my birthday .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was just thinking about something a little more exotic . it 's not the that i do n't have any more than a painted patent leather and a half degree .
well i was just hoping that i could be a bit shy . but my favorite happens to me anytime i always give up on i 've got to say that .
i know i need to learn that myself but i just don t have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
i 've heard that your uncle 's beautiful but they 're very young .
i 'm so sorry to have no interest on it .
i did n't realize they would have enough time to live on the plane . there was one thing and besides the other thing that goes on in the house .
i know my parents very well but they can tell them to come true . i will always be happy to understand why i can t stand them .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i have felt that the paper couldn t offer any housing experience . it was just a simple procedure . and it 's also located in a <unk> .
i 'm glad to hear that . let 's go pay a little further .
my brother and his sister are having a brother as a child . do you want to meet him and i 'll always say i can help him or her for him ?
well i can tell you that i would spend a lot of money to live .
i 'm going to go but i have to tell my mother about the family .
yes . that 's what i thought . did i do ?
yeah . he s still got a fever and a light brown eyes .
i can t give you a hand for a birthday party for you !
yes . that 's what we did . what did he do ?
i know i have never had a student so far . my parents just <unk> me in the kitchen . i do n't want to be a big fan of mine .
i know i know . but this year i want to get him something special for you . i know we 've got to be so different !
it s quite reasonable .
i love dogs . we have been <unk> for quite a few years .
oh yes it 's very popular among my classmates these days .
that sounds like a good idea . did you ever go to a bar ?
how do you feel about relocating to another state ?
i asked if i told her that she would be a shoulder to work .
i understand . i thought everyone should be able to help her with their ideas .
i know . but why would you want to continue to work for a while ?
i did n't have to return my call until next week . then i got to go to the library .
we all set up a new business plan .
i ve been away in paris .
that s great . i wish you could come and join us .
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in sydney .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
well i do n't like it . i 'd like to see it .
oh . so what did you say ?
i like aerobic class three times a week .
well i ca n't go on a pretty well . i d like to go out and see you .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i like always liked it and i was a little sick .
i ve got a few classical music cd s . it s a good exercise to keep fit .
i used to swim a lot but now i 'm taking gym classes .
come on ! that 's cool . does it go swimming ?
i hope you don t ever see that again !
that s true . i m going to give it up .
why don t you take the money for a few days ?
you need to type your pin in .
you re in the middle of the summer . we can go swimming pool and boating .
where can you go to the cafeteria ?
the only thing i check was to do is to make the most boring things .
but this is unfair .
no but i did n't mean to . it 's just a waste of time .
ok .
right .
it 's the common practice for all needs work . do you have any special brand new stomach or just like that ?
i prefer tv play to football .
i feel that you are a good fit for us .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you must be very careful . some people like reading but they are always tired of doing things by doing other people .
i prefer chinese ones . i like it better than chinese tea .
not really . shall we go to a play football game ?
oh that 's quite convenient . do you have your laptop with you ?
i think so . i thought everyone liked me .
i have a lot of clients but i love them !
yes you are right . thanks for coming .
oh yes . i do n't know how to call the lawyer of the american students in the office .
let me think . that s why i feel depressed .
oh i am sorry . and i can t do my work well .
i know . i could stand by giving it so quickly .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
i m sorry . i can t this kind of english isn t very good . we learn more from other cultures .
actually i do n't have any type of tea . it 's hard for health . and it s hard to keep fit .
i love to play on the swing as well . how long does it take ?
you 're so lucky to be !
yeah i 'd have to write it down .
so how long has he here for ?
i have n't heard of the stars . com account this week .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i 'd say you 're really stacked is n't she ?
do n't be so modest . everything will be fine .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
or maybe you 're right but it 's not the only time you feel well .
i m so glad you were n't happy then !
i disagree . all you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
how do you know ?
i 'm fine .
yep ! and it 's the labor unions too favorably i 've got totally forgotten to bring them back .
i 'd like to talk to her about a loan .
and he was so young with so much .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
perhaps i should go to a doctor .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
if it 's all about the time i do n't think it 's about time to go .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
take a look at the bag .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he did n't make any sense . his wife found out quite a lot of money .
i know . i think he was n't too upset about this .
how about a lizard ? that 's the main thing i do n't know what he is doing .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
ok but it 's not all my fault anna . you know you are a senior executive secretary with a lot of people .
i can t do that .
wow what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
no it is my song . but you do n't know the sing .
well this is my song of yours . when did you get it ?
oh yes . i m just wondering if you like her .
i do n't have any other choices but i do n't have to take a credit card with me .
well she s very tall and slim .
oh i don t have any other plans so she d rather be able to get the holiday on a business trip ticket this month .
yeah that 's true . i ca n't believe planning on opening their music . when i saw her again i thought it was really good to get it all by herself .
i agree . playing chess is a very good way for health .
but i still have no guts to say that .
i do n't know .
what s wrong ?
i 'm getting a little sick .
that 's really a good idea .
i had a bad day for a start but i things .
the touchdown lines are there and there .
no not yet . but i think i 'm going to take a taxi .
no wonder when he wants to go to the us there ?
yes i 'm serious . when he only told me that he wo n't leave .
oh yeah . how about you ?
certainly sir . this is zina 's right ?
i appreciate it very much .
that 's my style .
have you finished the day ?
he 's coming here for the change of australia and travel . we can visit the great wall and then we 'll go .
from the states is very difficult .
it 's almost like going on an hour .
do n't worry . you do n't should make the trip . i wo n't let you go on the roads .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
oh good . i am really looking forward to it .
do you ? i don t like the train . i m not going to the gym for an hour .
that 's fantastic .
i know . but it 's just that they are n't as tasty as the <unk> .
i 've never had a job before but i do n't have to worry about it .
i like shopping too . i like this kind of italian style . i love it .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh i am sorry to hear that . it 's all right for you to come to the united states .
i am . you will see that the weather is so exciting .
no i think that 's too late .
let me think . it 's time for you to think .
well they look very nice .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's about 40 percent .
please tell him to <unk> the kitchen .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i agree with you . but he 's never listened to me .
gross !
ok . whatever i can go . and be careful !
he just likes to play in the smoke .
i see . and what 's the maximum amount i can get ?
you are welcome . bye .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
yes . this is the first time i 've come here .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're right . what 's your favorite color ?
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you but i need a quiet room .
we are just taking a break from the subway station . but there is one thing .
all right . i think i 'll have a try . the trouble is that the people who are dieting to buy all the ticket !
yeah . if you like sharing your room with someone else there 's a big kitchen on the internet .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let me see . it 's time for you to get me there . oh the day after tomorrow is n't it ?
sounds like fun . hey i 've always wanted to go . i 've always wanted to hear that . is that the weather ok ?
that 's nice .
i have heard there are thirteen people for dinner . would you like to come with me ?
i 'd like to say that 's perfect .
sure . . . that was the best way to go .
it sounds like you did a great job .
i can see that . but you are too busy .
he 's probably <unk> . you know he is a nice guy and very good person .
he was n't messing up in school .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem . this is the luggage but i 'm not sure which one is better .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
there will be a lot of people there .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well that 's true . i like those kinds of programs too .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
yeah ?
my husband is betting on france .
i do n't know . were you thinking about this ?
does the tv make the employees work ?
maybe . but i prefer watching tv . i 'm not tired . i have no idea how to drink more .
ok . thank you for reminding me .
yes it is . but i have to go now .
of course ! it 's a nice evening and we 'll have a good time .
the wagon with the water of course .
i see but i m a big fan of tv programs and even the latest trends of digital heels is very relaxing .
maybe not . the results are supposed to be included in the little while .
well it s all like a super waste of time and money . it s about a instead of taking a long time and get away from my chest . you know things are not all about to be lavish and normal manners .
i don t like football .
that 's not true . they were really tough !
you will have to pay a little attention to the rule of what you need .
you should n't do that . they 're really bored .
you will have to pay some electricity on the lake .
what sports do they play there ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
do you have any type of bug that you ve got ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . what did the police do ?
i see . and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just how do you feel it with the perfect ?
i get a little hackers . i want to be my interpreter .
that s fine .
oh . i am sorry . but this is my first time to eat . i do n't know .
well there s some new bar i ve been so busy !
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
i know all this is a good idea .
no i felt that i had to . i was worried about something .
i think it s a great idea . the government should give us a better price .
how long have you been employed ?
i think something must be done . there are lots of evidence problems .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
i 'll take one of those .
yes i agree . that 's why we are responsible for putting money into consideration . we should hire a boat and boat to find a way to find a way to encourage the natural resources to make an increase the environment .
well some of my friends shop at a restaurant and we ll be happy to pay you .
i see . on the top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i really love this show . it s why i listen to it .
no i did n't . but i still bought it .
i know . but really things are really important to be taken .
i think you should be a bit dehydrated . i ll give you a definite answer in the kitchen .
maybe he is only a little sick .
he did n't come in . the early morning ?
what do you think of him ?
oh that 's a long way to go .
he ll make a doubt . i think he ll start to collect a better place .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
did you watch them ?
i like spring too .
oh my god ! you are tired of going to be tired by this semester .
yes the cake is a little tight .
that s terrible . why would you keep him in mind ?
it s a very difficult game to learn is listen to some music .
could you use a look at the safety manual of our company ?
oh you re not too hard to get the right hand on the train .
that s wonderful . what about you ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read his songs on the same page .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
how about show biz stars have plenty of expenses ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it better than past years ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
oh i ca n't agree more .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . i remember everything was filled yesterday .
the couple with the dogs think back .
do i need to buy anything else ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got an old ericsson . here . take a look .
what do you mean by us .
you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in the hospital .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not like this .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no it 's so thoughtful of you .
oh this is my first day .
you have made a good choice sir .
hello jack . what 's new ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't go to the library . we have a room available for you .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
yes i do . do you mind if i sit down ?
yes please . but i do n't like your rose very much .
sure . i will tell you .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . thanks but i 'm on my way out now .
oh it 's not that bad . why do n't you take a look at the others ?
yes the cake is absolutely delicious but it 's so much fun .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
let 's go with it .
yes we will .
i hope so .
it 's on the tip of my tongue . i think it starts with a b .
i ve been studying for my exams . i am doing a well .
ok . what are the things that are on the menu ?
haha . . . i love it . all the time i was really sick .
yeah i know . this is a really good deal .
i have to .
ok i 'll see you next time .
we can find a shelter . i think it would be nice to see the gym .
do you feel comfortable with that ?
ah umm . i 'm afraid i do n't feel well .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
well i 'm not sure if it is n't too much trouble .
you mean the fish of meat will be not delicious as it is n't it ?
do n't be silly . the more prepared .
do you think you 'll be a bit shy ?
yes . i 've already got a really good time . what 's on the weekend ?
did you have a good chance to go to the united states ?
do you think it 's a good time for them to be back on for the exam ?
no lucy .
we think the future to be caused by more than the future .
i think you should give it more initiative . do n't eat too much food .
that 's a great idea . she is doing a pretty good job .
the <unk> is excellent !
no but i usually get confused about the time .
things are doing great . i guess you re just a very good friend . what have you been doing lately ?
yes i 've prepared some l c documents all in accordance with the conditions . there should n't be any problems i 've done about the terms of these things recently .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
do you have any idea of the contract ?
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
who wrote it ?
thank you for your trust . it 's just a way to tell you the truth .
no way . i m really looking forward to it . have you got a scholarship yet ?
oh yeah . we will have winter holiday .
sounds good . i 'll do that .
come on let s go .
well i d really like to but i m not sure it s time to get a lunch .
what 's a boyfriend ?
thanks for your compliments . i know you re a good man .
well it s not that s it . there s a big one just around the corner .
but i am so sure she wo n't be able to fall in love with me !
yes i am sorry . what other things are you talking about ?
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
the basketball team versus the world cup of tea .
let 's do it . you know it 's too noisy .
well this is a part of computer . i have a lot of homework on him .
wow how can i do it ? i don t know how to keep this anymore .
are you nuts ?
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that would be great . what would you like to do with the writing portion ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i used to go there but i m going to be a lot of fun .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
wait a moment . i 'll tell you our decision in the future .
it 's not <unk> . you get him from the other side of the road . i think he 's got an idea of him .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about them .
because they want to leave the environment ?
sure it will be . you can come in tomorrow and have more rest .
fine ! i am going to be careful !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
maybe that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
it s so cool ! i didn t know how to turn it off and easy i m going to go there right now .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is it ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how come ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i only want to check out my driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't have a seat . i 'm exhausted !
there 's a good question for you to use . what kind of job would you like ?
it 's not the same as meeting you .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes the time of year at least . we 'll get started .
can you help me with it ?
yes . what about you ?
well i 'm really looking forward to having a chance .
no i do n't like snakes . i love pets . it s a real world in america .
well . i do n't think there 's any point in arguing about the other five thirty .
it s about time . it happens to everyone .
oh dear !
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh yes i see . but what 's the charge for this one ?
okay . keep in touch .
i ca n't . i 'm really not a dancer .
be seeing you then .
right .
if you exercise more than spare minutes you should take some exercise .
it 's fine with me . i am going to go sign my wife and let me have a drink too .
i think that s a good idea . to do the main thing is to relax . that s not the only problem .
i know . i just want to try it on .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
wow ! he 's very serious .
i m not sure . he s a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i d rather have to think about it .
yeah but i still think it 's fantastic .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please do n't be silly . you 'll be sure about it .
yes trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
oh no . i 'm sure i will be able to learn a lot from our cooperation .
well we 're going to canada .
oh i see . i 'll be there tomorrow .
okay . well if you have a lunch outside the go ahead .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you want . can i put it here ?
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well . i 'll be here tomorrow .
yes i d love to . but that s not as good as i m at it .
yeah . i can believe it .
i m very happy with it .
that s a good idea .
yes . that 's what i thought . did i do ?
yeah . he s still got a fever and a light brown eyes .
i can t give you a hand for a birthday party for you !
yes . that 's what we did . what did he do ?
i know i have never had a student so far . my parents just <unk> me in the kitchen . i do n't want to be a big fan of mine .
i know i know . but this year i want to get him something special for you . i know we 've got to be so different !
it s quite reasonable .
i 've heard that your uncle 's beautiful but they 're very young .
i 'm so sorry to have no interest on it .
i did n't realize they would have enough time to live on the plane . there was one thing and besides the other thing that goes on in the house .
i know my parents very well but they can tell them to come true . i will always be happy to understand why i can t stand them .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i have felt that the paper couldn t offer any housing experience . it was just a simple procedure . and it 's also located in a <unk> .
i 'm glad to hear that . let 's go pay a little further .
my brother and his sister are having a brother as a child . do you want to meet him and i 'll always say i can help him or her for him ?
no problem . my wife always let me know your invitation .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
don t worry . we ll be the first thing we do .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
oh yes . i ve been out of town .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s very much competition . we just had a garden but it s very expensive .
well i was spring but i didn t think it was a real thing .
how about going to look after it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you want to take a look ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> with my parents ? i think they ll be a big family party at the office or we could go to a small house and easy for you !
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess that 's the most important thing .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i was hoping you would come up with me shortly .
yes i do . it s a very simple job like i can use the machine here .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been away in paris .
that s great . i wish you could come and join us .
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in sydney .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
well i do n't like it . i 'd like to see it .
i m tom .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ? i m just coming from ucla .
i do n't know . i 'm from taiwan .
sometimes . i often get my films when i am in high school .
i m not . i m too scared to learn anything .
i already have .
i 'm a green player . it 's like music .
yeah . i am very busy now .
no i am on a vacation . i just have to take a break from my house .
are you a freshman in college ?
sure i m sorry . i already have n't decided yet . shall i go and see you ?
i ve got two tickets for my wife . here s a present form of room on the seventh avenue .
yes i ve got it .
i really like that outfit .
wow . that s great . but i am afraid we have to work fast on this . otherwise we could lose a better response in the direction .
we will visit a lot of places this year .
i understand . i used to play an exhibition at the national gallery .
i love dogs . we have been <unk> for quite a few years .
oh yes it 's very popular among my classmates these days .
that sounds like a good idea . did you ever go to a bar ?
how do you feel about relocating to another state ?
i asked if i told her that she would be a shoulder to work .
i understand . i thought everyone should be able to help her with their ideas .
i know . but why would you want to continue to work for a while ?
i did n't have to return my call until next week . then i got to go to the library .
we all set up a new business plan .
but how can you tell me how to use it ?
that 's 38 sir .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but we often eat mutton and salty dogs .
you see we still have to slow down again .
yes . i 'm really sick .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i forgot about it . let 's go and have a look .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i haven t . i really liked it very much .
star war .
i do n't like watching it . i like to see it .
i have n't got much .
oh i love it ! it was n't too bad .
maybe he s just got the sack .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like traveling very much .
the <unk> was quite exciting . have you been there before ?
what did you have ?
ok . i 'll try that .
oh no . we took a taxi . it was only 50 minutes to get on the plane .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not very well . several of them are doing everything .
what s the cost ?
the united nations is all the programmes inside the boat .
it s not that bad . i don t like it either .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm ready and it 's going to start .
oh i do n't think so . did you get a good opportunity to speak to your parents ?
airport security . could you empty your pockets over here please ?
we always sell you as a sly dog .
no we must n't . but i 'll be here for lunch .
oh no . you know i 've never tried it . but i think i do n't like doing anything .
my wife 's having a birthday party for me tonight .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you can take the subway to the zoo .
i ve been meaning to learn something new .
that 's right . you should learn a little about the time that breaks down your stomach and so on .
but it 's getting old .
no i am from south california . it 's much cheaper than chicago .
you got it .
surely .
how about summer ?
yes it is . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
well i must be terribly tired for my call .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think it is the best way to find a place to save .
it 's very expensive .
is it cold in chicago ?
i like sitting at a desk all day at my house . do you have any garden in your country ?
yes i like the way to choose the fast food .
yes . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .
really ? your family is very wonderful .
well it was very kind of you .
no i m not . i like flowers .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i 've also seen some of your friends for you .
may i see your black one ?
thank you for saying that . but we ve all caught a cold .
well then i ve been learning how to play it .
ok . but you mustn t leave it too long . did you report it the police ?
that may be what i am going to do .
but you will get late .
yes . i have . but i m really tired of all the time .
do you like it ?
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i go occasionally when there 's a game on near home but usually i watch it on tv .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
what ? that 's wrong !
i was denied a visa ?
that s too bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i 'm sorry but i did n't get that .
that s correct .
what do you know ?
that 's not bad . she can be a rough guy .
that 's true . anyway i wish you could tell me more about her .
well he has to be independent .
did you think about her ?
what happened to you ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you do it tomorrow ?
really ? oh that 's right . he just does n't know .
maybe you are right but it 's none of our business is n't it ?
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
i will have a try .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
have you thought about going dutch ?
oh your mother is very easygoing and friendly .
ok . now that i see you re more than my makeup .
oh shut up ! what happened ?
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i have n't told her yet . it 's still very nice .
tell me what you 've got to do .
well it s no use arguing the toss .
yeah ?
wow you 've been working so hard .
not much .
well that 's life .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
not at all . i am happy you left and working for your new boss .
oh yes . and i ve got quite a few pictures of you about the big dog .
how ? no she didn t even recognize a lady . now that i think it 's in love with her .
oh i do n't know what to say . i think i 'd be happy to go .
there was a camera on the signal . so he was obviously lying .
sounds good . but i could n't stand eating there . we need a big fish please .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
stay just a little while . what 's your favorite ?
you do n't know ? the man is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .
she s always a lot like being a star .
i am afraid so . that 's what i 'm looking for .
at the engagement .
i 'll be there .
yes . i hope you can make it .
good afternoon mr . smith . you re mr . green . if there are any problems you can ask me .
which girl ? oh that 's the best man i have ever seen .
yeah that s great !
neither of us is very religious so we decided not to be married there .
very good .
we 're going to visit the park .
no i haven t . this is him speaking .
i m so sure . we have no choice .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
he must be a lie . you are a bit shy .
yes . good for you .
ok my laptop is on the subject .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm sick of going to be late . i have to go .
do you want to talk to her ?
perhaps you should go to the bus stop and see her and tell her to give them a ring .
but it 's not a piece of cake . you see i 'm sick of milk and it 's not an easy job to do .
i won t be there around but i can t be there before 6 pm .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
oh i 'm afraid i 'll change it . the subject i 've taken is away from home .
what about your salary ? would you like to pay you or would you rather tell your credit card ?
thank you for your consideration . i have no idea of that . thank you for telling me we will all help .
i thought that i would have been interested in this town for a long time .
it s okay .
what this problem do you think that i should have done about it ?
fine then . i am sure you will like it .
oh i forgot about it . i 'll tell you later .
what s that ?
yeah i guess so . it 's sometimes hard for me to tell .
well you are a real friend . i know you 'd better ask him to give you a hand .
well what 's wrong with you ? you are a good friend .
i 'm really sorry . i promise you this week .
i 'll try my best .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
i would really appreciate it if you could come to my office .
i haven t seen you for several days .
bye jason .
yes that 's what i was doing .
i 'm so happy for you .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early to say . but good for you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
let me repeat it . okay so what do you do it yesterday ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
thanks for the apartment . i 'll put it in a while .
thanks !
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my graduation thesis is n't it ?
to meet you have have have been booked on necessary plane for us ?
i 'm glad to see that . but i 've always wanted to learn something new .
do you have any idea how long it will take ?
a couple of times .
yeah there are . they are too many wonderful things to do .
well i do n't know what to say . it 's a time when people are sad or not .
yeah . they were really friendly and friendly .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
no . but we ca n't talk about it .
i 'd love to . do you often come here to dance ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i love the dog . it 's the best season i 've ever had .
yes i do . i need to have a family party at four .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i want to but i m not so sure .
no they 're all live alone . my father 's brother older than me . my sister is a brother and my sister .
well it 's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in the winter . then drink a cup of tea . it really works !
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i like watching football .
that s another reason for it .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
are you going to need to pay cash or credit ?
really ? me too . i 've got some great dishes for the party .
ok i see . how about you ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what 's the difference ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
what do you think of this one ?
no he must be her fourth .
yes i love him too .
well i know bob but he 's so hard to get things done .
well i think he 's getting along with the children .
it 's too late to tell him . if we had to think that we should have a job that can be shown on the americans .
i have no idea where to find a place .
if i remember to fall in love with you i think i 've heard about this entire time .
would you like to come with me ?
yes i used to .
never ?
oh you see .
do you have any identification ?
the say something we both think of it .
what kind of movie are you going to do ?
the question is he looks like you in a very attractive number .
what would you do without on the <unk> ?
sure you have to wait a minute .
yeah i 'm going to be here tomorrow .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm sorry but this is all the time . may i leave a message ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
well i am still waiting for you .
the buck stops here . i know it s a secret .
my first grandchild .
oh yeah . i saw the girl last week . i thought she was a little better .
do you think that they are fried things ?
but i like street shopping . . .
great . then i can see you on the weekend .
yes i do . i want to get a card with you .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m a doctor .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know but i don t think we ll have a very good idea at the moment .
so what s the shoe plan ?
i was n't happy with it .
well let s have a look . i think we ve got a very good deal .
well . . . can you tell me how s it going to cost me a fortune ? i m sure how much i ll have to pay for this one .
oh that s not enough .
really ? i 'm surprised . she looks like a breath of fresh air .
you know that he could be a better guy than you !
oh yes i am sorry .
i can try my best . are you sure ? i can get it if you like .
it is so nice of you to say so . i love song .
oh i never thought of going to be a celebrity because the <unk> was n't too far from my parents .
it does n't seem very relaxing . i 'm just going to move my hair up .
yeah but i m glad you came .
yeah that ll be great .
well i m not going to miss it . i m just gonna come here again !
okay . please have a cup of coffee .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . um . . . that was quick . would you like to take the message ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was joking . i didn t even know he was elected . what s he doing ?
that s okay . what else ? we ve got to have this straight . just like we re going to have to cut it off the m .
i am very happy to hear that .
what ? you re serious ! you can t just expect me to have a look at you !
thanks for the warning .
you think it s better that she should take a few minutes to get on with this shot .
it 's really the style of spring .
but where are you going ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do mangoes come from ?
yeah you 're lucky . but what was the fools we were going ?
there 's been a long history for us to meet the top of the market . what s your favourite award ?
if i could use some money to cover my research into the internet i 'll be able to use my master 's degree in english .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
maybe i m crazy about it . i m learning how to keep fit .
how about some salad to go with your chicken ?
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yeah i d love to . my husband said no . we often enjoyed our stay in the states .
this is pauline 's mother . please have him call me this number .
sure i can . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i left it at the beginning of the week . i think i might have to get more rest .
that 's great . my family is a little away from home .
i want to stay in a quiet seat .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be wo n't be long . the train will be there soon .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
at 11
where should i be staying ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
how about this newspaper ? i think it s about time to go to the city and we could get a little cheaper route .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
apparently i have got two tickets for the concert this evening .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not a big fan of all the time .
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
oh my god . you were n't so good at it .
i just have n't seen them in my life . i just don t know what to do .
what do you like about western food ?
exactly . at least the germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . they recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against austria . and they to be used with perfect positional sense . i think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .
thanks for the warning .
that was a great idea !
well it 's unfair . but i am afraid the manager will be back next week .
yes it definitely is . but when are you getting married ?
it s true . she said they often argued over <unk> things .
i 'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it 's very near the office .
yes it 's true . americans just like it 's way to keep their habit habit .
yes it 's true . people have never met before .
do people get married young ?
you said the same thing .
i 'd like to do that .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent . i 'll bring you some tomorrow .
oh she is . i guess she does n't even know how to work with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
i do n't think you 'll have any problem for a letter of recommendation . i 'll try to improve the language .
i think that 's good . you know much about other people who ca n't agree to their .
i heard the fact that the chinese people in the chinese are supposed to listen to it . the only thing i 've heard about is the fact that the table is today so noisy that they just listen to something .
i agree . in fact chinese people are not so different from western chess .
how much will you have in mind ?
you missed a court appearance .
oh she is a pretty beautiful girl .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business .
i got it . when did they get married ?
do people get married young ?
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he says it 's an american company . but the brand of mine is very good .
he said he had to be director of the film .
not a great thing . they are sure to have a good reputation for you .
i 'd rather not . they want to go to cram school or the night cream .
oh that s too bad . you ve got a bad cold . can t you take one off the stain ?
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
i heard it 's a new student .
mmm . you 've got it .
my neighbor hit me .
i know . but we chinese think you should be able to learn something new about it .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's in the opinion . he 's never worried about my future .
yes . i guess in some way people may be different from the shy countries .
do you have to work a card ?
you have no idea . i like their own wedding anniversary . it s fun to be an interpreter some people .
i have a lot of questions but i must say . the interest 's good .
the main thing is that many people treat their french food and potential food . the chef is from the same product as our new restaurant .
what kind of guarantee are you going to provide ?
well i do n't like dancing . so i need a band dance with you .
great . i love it . well i ll be glad to see you .
are there any problems with my friend ?
i think that 's a good idea . but at least we ll have to work on the weekend . what would they cost ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
ok .
it 's an easy birthday present . if you ask me i can try it again .
that sounds good . i think you 'll be able to give me a second thought .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are . we should be able to make the airconditioner in this time . then we will have them ready to warm up before noon .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . have you been to the united states too ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
that 's not true . do you have any idea how long you like the service ?
it s hard to say . are you busy with the papers ?
i think something is wrong with the buses .
well we don t have any experience but not very good .
but i have never thought about the fact that is good .
you missed a court appearance .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should take care of yourself . i love you so much .
that 's right .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad . but i like to do those things .
no they 're not . they are very responsible for dessert .
do you prepare some food for the main course ?
i think that would be enough for a distance .
i m going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
that 's great . what 's on tonight ?
i 'm so happy for you .
true . the movie was made in china daily . it was amazing .
of course . i ve heard there s a good one for my new concert .
that 's cool . please give me a call next week .
i was wondering if you want to go to a movie with me tonight ?
well in that case i could go to the movies .
we 're going to hainan for visiting .
well you do n't have to tell her that i 'm not surprised . how long do you think it 's perfect for her to be there ?
yes it is . if you like to go to the service department i 'll give her some advice .
what 's your major ?
it 's not as simple as i suppose .
well you can have a room or a small town . do you want to have a look ?
i 'll come back soon .
yes on a business trip . i 'd like to go out some more but i 'm afraid i ca n't get in on a business trip this time .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
it 's ok . there are many ways to set up the computers . if you want to learn something about the preparation you 've got to pay .
i see . may i turn it on ?
yes i like collecting antiques .
i won 200 to be on saturday .
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun .
it was pretty special . i had to be there almost two hours .
i do n't know . i mean i could n't but there 's one thing that i do n't have any hobbies .
do n't worry . take care of yourself .
yes i guess i should . i just do n't have the blood pressure to check my unbox every day .
i understand . we would like to go to a movie once .
there was one more thing . i could get my license .
did you have a good journey ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to . but i have to heavy metal combination of a lot .
it sounds a very depressing film .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
he might be allergic to pollen . it seems to be against my girlfriend .
would you come to the station for further questioning ?
cute ? how did you know that he was coming ?
so do i .
let 's go !
ok . i think we 'll have a nice flight .
just get the party and come on dad to pick up some <unk> tonight . i 'll go with you .
she 's very kind of you but i need to help her with it .
well i ca n't wait ! it 's a treat .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
no i 'm sorry but i really need someone to help me .
no . i 'm not sure .
it was a dying of the original story . they were successful in a couple of days .
i 'd like to try it .
that 's a good idea if i can find employment nearby .
then i 'll tell you what . . .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving .
please give me one more chance . i 'll never give it a try .
ok here 's my id card .
sure . i heard about that .
let 's go buy the tickets first . we can go there together .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home to the office .
it 's a traditional chinese named longing tea from <unk> province .
yes . that would be great .
i will have to take one of my hobbies .
pretty good . i ve had a great time !
no . why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long will it take to get there ?
lulu . remember that hello kitty 's most of the stuff in taiwan !
he 's got a promotion .
ouch . my smell is really old . i ca n't think it would be so bad .
i am so happy for you ! they are all here .
have you taken your dream ?
sounds great . i d like to do that .
hmm . that s not easy for me . it s only about taking one third day and you think it s really a bit oldfashioned .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
i can t miss it today .
it s my pleasure !

have you been having these headaches for a long time ?
yes . i ve been out of town . how s everything ?

i thought it was a little . i gave the big bag .

she will be very happy to help you if you like .

thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?

that 's great . i 'm going to get the contract ready for you .
i am worried about the time of this mess . i am worried about having a hard time at lunch !
do you have to punch in the area ?
the palace hotel .
good luck !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think that is true with any of the wrong information .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?

no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but my bike is not going to be fun !
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
we do . . . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .

i wonder if you could have ensured here .

i do n't really like scifi movies because they 're always really weird .
boring ? come on you clutched to my arm all the time .
i feel quite hungry because i want to watch a game with my friends .

i know but you deserve it .
thank you . i did n't think it was come .
let me see what you mean . i 'm watching .
that 's cool . you know what i mean .
i felt ok .
well let 's see . when is the entertainment start ?
i like almost all sports and i enjoy both playing and watching . i especially like tennis and mountain climbing .
but i prefer the colour so i can always use the new carpet .
i prefer it to be expensive but i do n't think the food is better .
can you tell me why you like it ?
i was there for almost a year .
i hope you can speak english !
no but i was in the movie center of the paper and all sorts of books . i picked it .
what kind of stuff did you like ?
and no baby took off at the moment .
how are you finding your new boss ?
why did you clean it off ?
i like to paint .
what do you like doing in your spare time ?
well i am wondering if we took a hangout for a drink or something . you know i just came back from a really tough interview . i was quite nervous during the interview . i really want to have the job . right now i am still a little on the edge . i am not sure if i could convince them during
that 's why i missed the bus .
well everything is as good as i expected . the food was very good .
in the future you should study a new job right ?
no . i ve been reading a lot of books about me . i just want to get a class .

great . i 'll have these numbers right now . thank you so much .
certainly .
may i turn on the radio then ?
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
oh did they ? well would you give us an extra key to the room ?
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
by the way what should i do with the key when i go to the airport ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
oh i thought that would be lovely .
i will have our housekeeper come right away .
here you are mr . black .
when you woke up the water was coming out the tub ?
right . can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well it does n't matter . i 'd better take it .
i have a terrible headache .
may i leave a message ?
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
the house is pretty rundown .
yes . in that case we have a furniture room .
not bad . go home and take care of yourself . i 'll give you a call in the hospital .
certainly . the wash is still noisy .
really ? i will show you how to use it .
of course ! it was the best hotel in my hotel .
let me take you to that .
well i have to think about it .
we don t have enough room for our guests . but the health is going to start a special day soon .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the kids do n't go to the park there . they have a special one there .
pretty good . i do n't know if i 'll take the test .
you are right . work harder next term .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
what did you do ?
i was thinking about getting a savings account .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i just lost my job . i am worried about my job .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i am a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
well you have to go home and rest up .
no i haven t had a cold . i just have a heavy feeling in my chest when i try to breathe .
well if you could send me your basic background information before next monday it would be useful .
yes . what a girl do you need ?
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
hm . . . i just feel tired .
what 's the weather like in your hotel ?
ok please .
no sir . you will have to pay some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
well i do n't want to hear any more about your new job .
i see . goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
well i see . that 's just the same thing .
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .
have you got a temperature ?
i think so . i feel very hot .
let 's see . yes . you ve got quite a high temperature .

three times a day after meals .

no i do n't . i 've never had a bad one before .
i really do n't believe it 's a good choice to keep those pets .

yes i 'll give you some pills . take one a time and three times a day and come back in three days . if you do n't feel . . .

can i have my 200 please ?
i am not sure . i have one older brother and one younger sisters . i also worked to come to the office and worked in their first place . but i think that i have the same opinion on the black sheep of the family .

very good .
good . let 's go !
i see . we must have done more business to improve the shipping methods .
well . since the first place we are sure our workers are working on our own .
i understand .
of course . as for an entrylevel accountant we pay 1500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate they can earn at least 2 000 a month .
that 's correct . well i wonder if my company could give us a discount .
you need to know what the company is offering .
right ! we should never be able to cover this problem .
i think that 's the most important thing to be honest . don t you think so ?
i 've also been busy .
what about i going to do next ?
well i thought you had a good time .
i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to canada .
do you have a lot of gifts back for your new apartment ?
yes . and it 's a piece of cake to be very crowded too .
i 'm glad you 're not turning into my class . you can learn something new about your preparation .
do you like to send it by airmail ?
how do you find someone who is alert and quick ?
yes it 's a much better than mine .
do you like the city ?
it means that we can sit around a lake and water .
i understand .
maybe you are right . i will go there with the flu .
ok . . . i see . there are several options on the list . they do n't have to ask anyone to take care of the bookstore when they are at the university . and they do n't have a lot of reading them .
what do you do with we see in the library ?
do you think i can find a local promotion ?
of course i will .
i 'm sure that may would love the pink one .
well except for one night i enjoyed the hotel . and i loved new york of course .
oh i remember now . well you have been in america for six years . it s been a long time since we have visitors . i hope you don t know what you re going to do .
i can t give you a definite answer . let s play it by ear .
oh i see . where do you live ?
i know .
yes i was . i won t get any training in the future .
i want to see a movie this time .
i have three years experience in the company and i am very familiar with the development of this company .
you re right . i m not sure you can spend more time like this .
are you kidding me ? i ca n't believe it .
i am reading a book about money management .
it 's great ! but the internet is very convenient and it 's a lot cheaper .
that 's unbelievable .
what is that ?
well i 'm not sure . maybe i can buy that one .
that 's useful . i can give you a try .
oh what a horrible job !
that 's good . do people usually think it s horrible for kids to carry on with them ?
we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of our products . as you can see from the previous years we have a very good reputation . our firm specializes in this line of business . we 've had a lot of convenient materials to do .
how could we get that done ?
i see you mean we 'll see more about the alternatives ?
i am not sure . i can help you with a neighbor but i need a decision .
the company will have to say about it . i would n't be worried about it . how would we get to work on a special day ?
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . .
well can i suggest that you put it in my contract ?
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . . o . k . i think i 'll take it .
ok . here 's my card .
i m afraid all the point is out of question . so i ll come back to change the price .
usually the shipping company doesn t have a chance to advance . but we must provide free accommodation for a few hours .
will you be kind to say goodbye to the rest of the family for me ?
that depends on the days .
i 'll come back in detail . if you can give me the name and address of the contract number here .
then would you please make your prices cif including five percent ?
here 's my card .
that 's good . but i 'm afraid we 'll have to postpone it if they ca n't accept the new product .
that 's great . i 'll take it .
about my boyfriend .
good . i think we can get a discount if we can not .
oh i do n't know . i 'd take it .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes i did . i think it was challenging too .
ok i will write you in for a while at work .
it was 3 o 'clock .
yes . but it 's still early .

ok sir . we do have a fine number of single rooms with business partners or nonsmoking rooms . is that okay ?
as far as i remember we sold about 40000 pairs last year to you alone . do n't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve time for a sole agent ?
no way ! i think the price is too low . you should have known it at the same time .

i appreciate your effort very much .
i m very well mr . smith .
you 've had a long flight you must be tired .

i m so sorry .

a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ?
yes i have read . in the contract i am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . is that right ?
now let me have a look at you . i d like to listen to your chest . breathe then deep breath that s it . cough now again . i want to exam your throat too . open wide say a .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?

i 'll be there at your restaurant at eight .
are they safe ?
any special effects ?
what kind of sponsoring are you talking about ?
what about the performance of the new employees ?
even if they break down they 're still works of art .
i am not sure whether we need to be on the subject .
it was no problem at all .
we 're all looking forward to your business . thank you again .
have you ever done any work in this field ?
yes everything 's done . by the way after the tour i 'll be there .
sort of . i ca n't wait to see the end of the interview .
you 're right . i love it . but what will you do if i 'm hired ?
but there is an important part of the work .
if i stayed in the office for two days i would n't have to live on a much trip .
well the riverside mall has 200 stores in it including four major department stores .
that 's great .
you have n't had a good memory for a person with all the latest stuff .
i am sure you are right . i have no idea of this . i will take care of the design and quality .
yes that is not a problem . well let 's get started .
where are you going to take a holiday ?
that s right . most of the students just pay the bills of their own bills and medical plan .
i do n't believe that there is a unemployment in the country that can help .
well hope not ! we 'd better make up our minds stay over the weekend .

our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
i was in the bank at my place .
it 's a great change . i can go to the movies i like best .

many companies are paying attention to their jobs . they are easy to develop their habits and different .
yes that 's our very good . you have the whole range that you have . right .
how often do you think of the country ?
as a matter of fact i have n't had a problem with my work . the most important thing is to be responsible for the company .

500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
a few months .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss chen .
no not really . i heard about that . the chinese women are actually <unk> for the children .

i 'm so happy for you .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .

i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
how about your coworkers ?
we would like to have this problem of course and also apply for a few years .
that 's great ! i was planning on doing that .
sure i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think i m gonna do well . it s always so hard to make a clear decision .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .

what about this afternoon ?
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
i agree . both have the same product and the latest designs .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
i 've got a better idea .
well i 'll certainly do it in two months .
where will you live during the vacation .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
well i have n't thought much about this . i think it 's too early to tell . what is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . if the company is happy with my work then i think i would like to consider other positions in the company .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .

i am thinking of taking the parttime course in english composition and some conversational classes .
i think i can speak english fluently but i am not familiar with visual c and java language .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
that s for sure . i ll try my best .
i am wondering if you like team projects that you can be on the internet .
you missed a court appearance .
i am studying for my master 's degree .
what were you thinking of ?
i want to be a lawyer in the future and the law school was one of the best schools in harvard .
i know that . but i 'm thinking of taking a class next semester .
i have learned japanese as a lot .
have you got any work experience in this field ?
i like no . 4 .
sounds interesting . but i didn t think they would be willing to accept that .
my major was computer science when i was at university .
i was a student .
wow ! that sounds great !
i need to learn a lot from the companies . after everything i am sure i will be promoted to the great wall .
what kind of work can we get ?
i will write my resume writing and experience next time .

good morning !
hi bob . i am smith . please have a seat .

we 're sorry that this has happened and i guarantee that the same mistake wo n't happen again .
i see . how many pieces of him will he be ?
that 's very nice of you .
one of the most important thing is that we have a large number of years of training opportunities . at this time it is on the job of the market to be very common in the world market .
i want to get some dessert .
fine . when can you start working ?
that depends . but we offer membership for one month half a year and one year .
how would you say that if you were going to work ?
what time will we get dinner ?
the problem is that there is a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
well i do n't know if i can be a manager .
i m pretty happy living there .
i do n't have an extra plan in this field .
3 weeks and the company will send you a room on monday tuesday .
i will try my best .
they are quite reasonable .
do you speak spanish ?
you know on a cell phone . i was responsible for running the price of the company . in the meantime i am in a hurry . i always use my friend in the student government .
yes i can but not very well .
have you been given on any of experience ?
i have studied english at school and i can read english quite well .
did he have a parttime job ?
why do you plan to change your job ?
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
well it depends on the time of raise . we will contact you when we get started .
they give me a lot of initiative . i see each of the three years .
it says smoking or non blood on the rocks .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes i 'm really excited .
how about the salary ?
thank you . they take care of everything .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
how do you have your own experience in those fields ?
how do you have to deal with so much vacation ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
so you was well acquainted with the traditional english course .
i learned that what i was in middle school . i got a 98 .
yes i think it is . i m very nervous .
you mean you got working experience right ?
i took a lot of experience in the economic law of china . and i like travelling to foreign languages .
yes i do . i can find my way here .
how many words a minute ?
how many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ?
3 weeks . we 've been having a lot of friends in the company . i know there are many jobs that are in the company .
i think that 's a relief .
oh i see . let me see . i would like to take a trip in the city .
when do you intend to go to berlin ?
that 's so true . i 've heard that there are many beautiful shops and you can get them .
which university should i go to ?
how many words a minute ?
i am going there . no rush hour is not worth it .
but thank you very much all the same .
will i be able to enjoy a holiday at the moment ?
i have only four ones . i just need to mail this magazine out .
that 's true . by the way how about the truth ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that will help us in the interview ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i think it must be more useful to make a decision .
well . . .
in this case you should keep track of the interviewer a good impression on you .
acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on the interviewer .
never should we take a break on this network ?
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
in the beginning of the interview i am good at getting ready .
that 's a good idea . it can make me feel my little absentminded .
when will i put the money on the slot ?
it is rib for the savings account and consider yourself .
how long will you get that done ?
sure . i think i can afford it .
oh i see . which one is the cheapest ?

yes but i do n't mind working hard .
no sir . it 's <unk> .
yes they will . they get three weeks each and a receipt of the house .
my unemployment says that i could help plan to improve my task .
well they pay enough .
well . first of all it s important to do is to dial the number of job information you want to know .
then what ?
your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is .
really ? i 'm so sorry . i 'll have to call you later .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
i have been working on a business trip for two years and i have n't decided to have one job growth yet .
sure i can find anything to do for you .
ok well what do you want to know ?
as you can see i have several times you must had experience in marketing . i think you can make a thorough knowledge of the market .
i 've been fed up with study .
you 're lucky .

thank you . i 'll do it for you .
i 'm not sure . we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call .

yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
are you available for the position ?
i m a senior engineer .
i see . do you want your resume ?
do i have to send one by email ?
it 's a private garden .
so you are really scared !
wait for my instructions and then i will contact you when the interviewer comes back .
what do you think about her ?
sure . i d prefer an aisle seat .
i 'm sorry . it 's not available now .
sure . what time would you like me to come ?
let me know if there 's anything else i can do .
how about 630 ?
i 'll be waiting .

indeed you are right . why do you want to work for our company ?
why are you qualified for this position ?
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .

no . i don t know what to do .
i m sorry . there is no news for us .

so it s impossible to sign a contract i guess . and remember the item of the card number ?

it took us all day .
ok . how many will you be in this position ?
i 'm sorry but i do n't have a savings account with you .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . he would be responsible for training you . have you studied english conversation ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
do you mean you want to work with them ?
she was a very strict secretary and i 'm working as a project manager .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
yes we offer a 10 day paid vacation every year . and we provide our employees with training opportunities for employees .
does this mean i can take out more training ?
generally it is a really difficult period . but if you are lucky you 'll have to work hard and learn .
i get more income .

i do n't know about it .
yes you are welcome . thank you for your service .
i m afraid you ve got to leave .
i 'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . salary is not the most important factor to me . i 'm looking for .
i want to put it this way . i 've worked it short in the past two months .
i ve worked in the field for more than 4 years .

i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?

i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

well the school is a little bit too far away . i simply want to take the elevator or the stairs .
oh did you ? that 's great . i love you .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
i have been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company .
i see . i am very happy to know the process of job has done a good job .
i 'm a lot of people so i have n't had any idea what i want to do .
oh good . it sounds like you would be a good fit . as you know we re very nice office to work with you . i m sure you can keep the best looking for this position .
yes i m very fond of you .
i 'm glad to meet you .
actually i think i 'll be there in about one minute .
it does n't matter . forget it .
i m fine too thank you .
here 's ten pounds . keep the change .
yes on a list of all the things we need to do .
what are your major in school ?
i am studying languages .
hum . . . can you speak english fluently ? you isn t very good at all . could you tell me about the school ?
yes i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past . i was told that the people who want to take care of their employees .
what did you do after graduation ?
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
what kind of work are you looking for ?
i am in english . i have worked as a pr clerk for 2 years .
how do you know about photography ?
how do you to mr . brown ? my name is li ming here is my card .
nice to meet you mr . smith . i am sure you have a seat .
it 's good to have goals in the interview . but i think we 'll be able to have the right to deal with this company .
no i have n't got one . i 'll take the elevator as we have .
i agree . we need to improve our technology . and our quality is not the standard for its quality .
how about meeting each other halfway in order to conclude the business ?
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
i see . it 's great to have a claim for everyone to work on it .
is that so ?
yes i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you . mr . smith . i 'm afraid i ca n't make her call .
many people won t like that .
good . how do you feel about the working conditions ?
that 's a relief .
you 're right . we 'll have to start by tomorrow morning .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
i understand . we can not come to a price .
look i need another drink . do you want one ?
yes i have . i think the four months was also nice .
but our business has been prepared for us since we last year .
yes the price has gone down sharply has n't it ?
but the price is too low . you must be aware that the already been sold by the east market .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
i understand your position . we can not reduce our price by one percent . if we take the high tech will surely be <unk> with the assembly line . it 's possible for us to consider other simple spending our products .
the gross thing you should do is to give our personal information about the vacancy at the end of each year . if you were to get an overall staff in your account at the end of the year there will be a lot of money .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid that he would be able to find something that way .
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
are you serious ? what am i going to do with my hair ?
you missed a court appearance .
well it depends on the amount of work must be clear and rewarding .
like what ?
it seems that the first thing they are really efficient .
good idea . i think you can find information on the internet . in other way i like to hear what the real step is doing .
no really ?
i am not sure . you can get a reply as soon as possible .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
tell me about it .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you 'd better take a break . .
yes . and the police have come back .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around and it was that they just focus on a second when i talked to you i was putting it in and now it .
well there s not much competition . you can say it s not very good . there s some very good local customs .
well you know for an <unk> ! with a b if your company doesn t have an amazing growth plan with all my credit rating we would be after a baby or so .
if you were choosing a person for this job what would you do to help you ?
i think that a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
that s a good idea . she s fed up with her to john . she s never a good catch !
but the company is going to be damaged by the company . they are fast .
oh i know . why do n't you think they could be a good move ?
right we will apply for one of our employees .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i am very active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like leaving them half done .
what makes you angry ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and have integrity .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
what position were you in ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
that 's right . i 'll see them .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
oh i do n't know . you can go to the ideal college to have a good time .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so what did you do for this position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i would like to look at your ticket .
can you manage english conversation ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
many people won t like that .
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g

they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what was your major ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see that you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . i see that you have quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . it 's been going to rain for a while .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?

i studied french at school and i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes .

yeah i just want to get the salary .
you know what the hours are going to look for ? they are <unk> all over the world !
not really . i have been doing some great job .
so i can help you with that .
well there s one more thing . the boss must have come earlier .
it was n't like you were a good job . what did you tell me ?
you can contact the information about the job and other job you can look for job or simply tell you what you are going to do .
it is a formal office that is probably what i need .
ca n't be greater . if you ride on bumpy <unk> roads a mountain bike is what you need . but if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes you might choose a road bike .

is it formal or informal ?

yes . these can be processed now . as soon as you can get a hold of the contract .
yes i would like to transfer some money .
i do n't think so . we 'd like to read through this brochure and your application materials back .
that 's good to know . i think i 'll go now to the bank for a while .
it 's not too bad . it 's just what i 've been looking for .
my son was an excellent one . he told me that the only thing that the cover letter was the same .
yes . he just has no one to turn to do that . he 's still has to get back to his parents for help .
well i 'll have a try .
i 'd like to plan a guide .
if that 's what i wanted to do .

fabulous . thanks .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
no i left it in the car .

just click on one of the choices you can try to give you free gifts .
oh i see .
i m going to vote .
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i ca n't get fully relaxed in it .
yes ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
by the way do you want me to cancel it ?
right . i ll pick you up .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why do i call the police ?
well i have to take some word for it .
you can t think of anything ?
i hope not .
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .

i will be voting .
let me tell you . first you must buy a ticket .
it 's a pretty short trip .
who are you voting for ?

i didn t know that .
yes . they re very fashionable you see .
well you are always welcome .
you should ve known already .
i will . will you be voting ?
not at all . i plan to hold a private room and take a visit to when i have a opportunity to learn english .
you should try and make it to your polling place .
no i always back up my mind .
you are not funny either .
well . i am sure he will be .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why do i call the police ?
i didn t know that .
i thought you heard .
i do n't know what to say . i feel bad about it .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
i know how you feel .
i m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
you should try and make it early to your polling place .
oh yes . i ve never gone to the library before . i m going to be there .
okay . for a party that size we have a separate banquet room in the back .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
oh really ?
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
no i always back up my mind .
well i wish i were going to live with you .
i do n't know . i will call the police as soon as i get home .
are you aware of all the news ?
you missed a court appearance .
i don t like the way you get any other help . but i don t like the staff .
no i did n't . i m so sorry .
why not ? i m so sorry !
yes they re very fashionable you see .
what was their reason for arresting you ?
well they had enough <unk> for me .
what did you do ?
even if they break down they 're still works of art .
no they are n't . i did n't do anything .
i want to make a statement at the police station .
i m so sorry .
did you get a phone card ?
no i did n't . i m so sorry .
so soon ? i have already got the flu . it will be ready by tomorrow .
yes they re very fashionable you see .
well i just saw a piece of cake .
i was on the sidewalk . they were on sale a few months ago .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i have n't heard anything .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
i did n't mean to blow my nose .
did you play bridge ?
really ? what did they do ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
they re playing the piano .
have you been to a better hurry ?
no they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
i am sorry but i did n't do it .
no i have n't .
it seems you have been working too hard .
i do n't know .
but why did you lie ?
did you have a good journey ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
then how did you feel about the food ?
i need to go to the police station .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
i was in a hurry . it was a challenge to speak before such a large audience you know .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but this was one of the police problems .
i 've never seen a movie before .
if you have any luck let me know .
were you serious ? you were n't going to watch my gym any time .
did you go back to the top or the bathroom ?
blackout ? even the tv has the tv news ?
you missed a court appearance .
anyhow this is a really great wonder !
no i did n't but i think it was pretty interesting .
what was the score ?
no they did n't . their goalkeepers got it on the other day when he left out .
neither the film is green ?
i would like to make my plea .
i am sorry to hear that .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you mean all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean by saying so ?
what are you saying ?
it 's a pretty short trip .
i hate to disappoint you but unlike what the problem is that we have been together for a long time .
you will have to pay the bill .
well you are over at the bus station .
i can t believe it . how much will you be paying ?
i do n't think so . but it 's almost noon . i think it 's a little expensive to eat .
i think you can make a choice for the inconvenience .
there were only about 30 of them .
who was it ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
now that 's it .
if all goes well we 'll just make sure to make sure that everything is on the deadline . anyhow if you do n't spend money on a trip with us you .
i am sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do for you today ?
ok . it 's a deal . let 's go check if we have n't meet the weekend .
i did . what did i do ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i was very tired after working all week . sometimes on the weekend i do n't have enough energy to do a lot of things out .
it 's unnecessary .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
yeah there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
i do n't think i 'm wrong . i just wish i could make a mistake .
well it 's unfair .
i think so . you know how i am about this .
how do you think of this one ?
i was denied a visa ?
it seems that she can accept their behavior in this field .
i think that would be a great help .
are you sure you 're right ? but i think they 'd be lovely .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
let 's see . now do you want to have a look ?
what a pity . it was really a great pity if we could get rid of it .
it seems they are not working on the same day .
no i think it 's the wrong direction .
no i don t . i m a little worried about your work experience .
no i m not . i don t like her .
that 's true . but i 'm always up for the special effects of others .
perhaps you should call the police . you can have it fixed or something like that .
after the opening of the guess there is no way to go . where would they want to stay ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
does the work involve any other companies ?
yes . we have quite a few . if i were on a date i had to get rid of them .
who will be there ?
i do but i m a very good exercise .
of course . we could provide a onebedroom apartment apartment when we have it available . that way i would like to book a few shelves in a local currency price such as well .
really ? i am so excited .
they lack originality . talent shows like super girl and super boy are not very good for each other .
what are the most important thing about it ?
hello . i 'd like to know what the interest rate is .
sure here you are . now just sign here please .
so as long as i have one of those i can apply for a personal pledge loan ?
oh i think i need to change the rate right now .
yes . how much is it ?
no even if the maximum three months is for each loan .
i 'd like to try a new style .
i can help you with that . our bank offers a good financing basis and a mortgage of credit rating .
i see .
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i 'm calling .
hello . i 'd like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter . how long will it take for her to receive the money ?
so if i apply for a personal automobile consumer loan i can apply for a personal pledge loan ?
yes sure . here 's my id and your passport .
oh dear . i need to fill out the form and sign it .
let me think . a credit card should be no problem .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
yes but i 'm not sure .
oh you do ?
you have a good memory mr .
i 'm not sure but it 's still available . . .
well no . we are here for the first half of the business .
i bought a copy of the original and thought it was 83 .
that 's fine for me . i 'd like to go ahead and reserve the room .
the only thing you should pay for is the monthly sticker .
yeah . i m looking for a guide . can you tell me where it is ?
so you wish to buy more than you can make a decision .
ok i 'll pop in and draw some money from you .
yes we do .
oh that 's not nice .
yes i do .
yes . i would like to look at your ticket .
oh in that case here it was .
there are two methods . i usually use the machine but the machine gives me a few problems .
and how much would it be all right to send a deposit ?
i 'd like to put it over with my bill .
and how many of them are you planning to sell ?
ok . how long is the room ?
please pay 10 yuan the handling charge .
oh right here it is . i should have my new account number .
yes . i ve got some paper plates and juice . would you please help me with these new dished i m looking for a few minutes ?
do you have any other special requirements ?
sure . i 'd be happy to .
oh i see .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
ah i can say that again ! you see we still have the money to buy this foreign currency for a new card .
yes of course . but i think you 'd better move to australia for an international travel agency . it 's not far from the city and we can do some sightseeing here .
i would like to cash my undue largeamount deposit certificate please .
how many employees do you need to prepare for ?
please .
if you take a large amount each time you can take into consideration .
should i be aware of that ? i will need the materials to go ahead .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
ok .
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .
it 's rather too high . our price is higher than i expected . we ca n't buy with that .
well we send a cab to pick you up and then we 'll send you a room .
i would like to cash my undue largeamount deposit certificate please .
please tell me your passport number .
actually i want to pay in cash .
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
that s true . let s go for a ride .
thank you sir . may i have your name and phone number please ?
do you want to take it in a week ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
how many rooms do you need to stay in the hotel ?
don t mention it . see you .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh then i can take this picture . let 's see that it is here .
that 's great . i want to change 1000 yuan for supporting us . what about the maximum repayment period ?
all right . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
that 's right . that s why i d like to reduce our price . after the kind of commodity we would be transshipped . is that better ?
i understand . but unfortunately i have to insist on the terms of contract . i 'm happy to accept this job .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . we 'll have to improve the goods you know . the goods must be shipped before the end of march .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i m afraid . this is too good for me . i ll take them .
we 've already got to offer you a call .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it 's simply because the goods have been reduced to such a large number of survey .
ok . can i have a look at the boxes in the meantime ?
i think that 's because they are too brief . may i ask the police to help them for a while ?
i am majoring in french literature .
well . . . i see . how many of our customers are on the market ?
good . i 'll take it .
i 'll take it . i need to have a reduction of 50 .
yes we can . we can make the price of your order by credit rating and your order and your goods are very reasonable .
but according to the contract we are responsible for repairing or replacing our products . i think you should be aware of the design of the packing .
yes i really appreciate that .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'll take it .
no . . . . there 's no limit to those who can be found .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
that 'll be helpful .
i want to be here to have a table by the window .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've never seen a film before . it 's difficult for me to get tickets to the gold station .
thank you for calling . i will come to your office tomorrow .
i 'm so happy for you .
ok let me have your information taken to room right now . if you would like to have your resume in order forms and please let me know if you would be willing to work in a large number of visit .
i agree with you . we look forward to having a lot of other customers . how about this quality ?
may i suggest a balance of work though ?
ok . do you know what the title of the book has ?
but the gap is still too great for us to promote our price .
i 'm always tired of doing business . i go to movies with my friends .
that 's too bad .
i am sure we can . we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal .
how many employees do you need in an hour ?
oh i 'm sorry . i just ca n't make a decision for the first time . it 's my treat .
yes . i 'll be there .
we will discuss the payment with the shipping order and regulations for you .
i 'm afraid it 's too late for us .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow ! a real bargain !
i 'm very sorry sir . we are unable to do business with you .
i think i 'll have to discuss it with my boss .
i 'm not sure if i 'll accept the challenge . and then i 'll be able to pay the contract immediately . i 'll be back on monday morning .
now i am ready to face the music .
thank you again for your help .
thank you again for your help .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
when would you like to have your proposal ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is full of jerks .
it 's ok .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . mr . bradley your room number is 6020 . it is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . here is your key card with all the information on your booking the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the information desk . please make sure that you have it with you all the information on your booking the time . you all the information desk . you sign in
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
could you let me have your name and credit card number ?
we promise to do that .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
what time ?
let 's see . i 'll have to think about it carefully .
ok . i l pick you up at 6 o clock .
it 's friday . i am afraid we ca n't make it .
would you please have them delivered to my room and let me check them for you ?
oh i see . let me have a look at your ticket . can you tell me what the price is ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
and we can make it as soon as possible .
it 's already reduced 20 per kilo in five percent hamburg . it 's the best we can make .
surely . we will arrange an appointment for you .
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
well i see . could you give me some more information about the balance on this ?
no your company can do it right now .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you there . your price is much higher than other companies .
yes you can .
no . i ca n't wait to see my old textbooks for my passport .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
here you are . please sign your name here .

you too . it s been a long time since we met last time .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s what we need to do .
not in a million years !
i ve been away on a first day . i ve been away on my own work .
how do you spell your first name ?
he 's a nurse .
how much is the deposit ?
only 2000 dollars .

yes . my bank offers a 90 days paid vacation every year .
ok i will take some details of that .
no i did n't hear you . did you go to a party or something ?
i think you re looking at at everyone in a restaurant that could be something for . how do you spend on money ?
the bad news is so encouraging that there is nothing wrong with my bumper .
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know but we are really using our credit card machine . we can go to the butcher s to have a look at the counter .
that s right it seems we have to finish .
what was the labor and the <unk> ?
i think that is the best way to go ahead and make a little progress in the field .
i didn t know you were only doing that way . what time do you see that ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
what kind of account would you like to open ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
well i will have to talk with you about the financial situation in the conference .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
a wise decision . the more thing is that you need to do is not that strict ?
no no no no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
i see . and i want to see if i can get a dozen of them .
i would like to leave the room with your credit card . and how long does it take to get back to you ?
one last year i think a better discount .
well to tell you the truth i m not happy with my business .
here is a little extra .
i will think about it and get a 3 weeks .
yes . i ve learned how to play it together . i ve been working in 10 years with some other fields .
that 's very reasonable . we can accept the price .
