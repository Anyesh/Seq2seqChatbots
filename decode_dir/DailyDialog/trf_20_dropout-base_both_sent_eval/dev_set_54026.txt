well let 's look at some of the come and see what we can do .
that 's very kind of you .
sure . we have several different styles of chinese food .
sure . what 's the cloth ?
i think red would be a very good taste .
it 's so busy . i 'm having a big wedding with my family .
what 's the charge ?
thanks . now i have nothing to do with me .
it is in the front of you .
it 's on the west side of the international hotel .
what 's the price ?
one dollar .
i 'm not sure what about you ?
would you like some salad ?
no thanks . that 's enough .
eating here or to go ?
could i use it to reserve a copy ?

certainly . i would like to help you with the very simple carpet .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were only going to get in .
yes it 's on the third floor .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i 'm sorry .
that 's very nice of you . i guess i can help you .

it must be costly .
in that case i ll take it . look at it this way please .
i 'm clear so far .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . they must be an opera star in the end .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes of course i could . even though i had to buy a house that would allow my parents to go shopping for their honeymoon .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the price of the real thing .
this one ? with those who are of the latest fashion .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .

we should do this more often .
okay .
i am cooking .

the party would be there at 730 a . m . ?
that 's great . we can discuss the contract in the morning .
i really appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
i like looking at cool shop but i 'm lots of fun .

enjoy yourself .
i 've come to work with you .
actually i do n't like cooking very much .
yes i agree . do you have a favorite ?
well there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
what do you have in mind ?
how about some coffee and tea as well ?

no . they are all good . the french wine is very delicious .
i would like to have the green tea .

ok i will go now .
thanks . see you tomorrow .
i 'm so happy for you .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you think that there 's a place where you 're from ?
what do you think of this ?
not really . i would certainly like to try them one when they went to the big groups .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
it 's a very good idea .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .

if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm so sorry . maybe you 'd better go .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
you 're welcome . this is your key . if you need anything else just dial 0 .
you 're a good idea . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
great . let 's go now .

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well maybe you 're right .
i thought it was a little more .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
that 's true . do you have any hobbies ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . today 's sale is still available .
yes it 's very simple . it 's pretty safe to take advantage of people 's social life and social security and various ages . many of people have lost their attention .
but we already have some cookies left here . can you give me some more napkins ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?

have you been looking for somewhere for two weeks ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
thank you . that s very kind of you .
ok . there is one more thing .
when was the apartment itself ?
i 'm afraid it is too close to the price . can you tell me the details of the car ?
do you have a car in the neighborhood ?
i had a meeting with a bath from the university of charge .

it is very quiet and peaceful .

well i am sorry we have no direct flight .
you wo n't promise !
it 's only 24 a month .
here is ten dollars .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
are you kidding ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
ok . i am monica . i just got a telephone call .
thank you very much for your advice .
hello . is that shirley ?
that 's for sure .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i am . i really don t find the key .
what would you like for a drink ?
no problem . i would be happy to .
ok .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
ok i will go get it for you .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
yes of course . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the city and the center of the city .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in the regular price .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see he is so successful now . and he is just in love with me .
stop stop . . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to class .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven .
mike this is leo in sales . i was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend .
it 's mrs . thou ping .
fine thanks . i m doing some better thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
if you get the promotion what will your new title be ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
you are welcome . but i am not sure if it is your annual business .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
she 's my brother .
i began to went there last month .
i ll do my best .
she 's handsome .
but what does she do ?
yeah i heard it 's a lot better than paying someone else .
hmm . . . well that might be a lie . you know he had a good match .
but that 's not the way to have a taste .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
i 'll be there .
you ? i was just watching a little weight .
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
are you going to the car shop ?
when i put what else i don t want to put up with the cut .
sure . i m really bored ! what s that ?
what happens if i put on the car ?
awesome ! i m gonna get a dozen red roses !
well . . . i used to have the best <unk> . but . . .
what kind of games do you like ?
there s no use . why ?
yes . could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in germany ?
what about all these red ones ?
i d like to have a try . do you have a glass of red wine now ? i d like to have a glass of orange juice please .
you must have bought a new one .
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i 'm not sure if i can .
do you have a credit card with us ?
oh i see so it s a similar city .
how much is it for ?
i don t buy an inexpensive camera .
uh where do you go ?
i thought that many people were supposed to save money in the country .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
i 've been feeling this way for a change of clothes .
what s the problem ?
thanks . lovely day . pity i m on duty .
when i get back from the apartment i was looking for a new pair of shoes .
thank you and have a great day .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
ok .
no that 's all . thanks .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
what are you going to do about it ?
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find out how much i can afford .
do you like red roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why i can t wait to buy it .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can you be so sure ? everyone knows a lot about going around the world .
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will go shopping . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
i want to sign up for some funds units . how do i go about it ?
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had an important meeting with a client .
we re in the bathroom !
it s ok . you look so pale . i can t wait to see you back here .
i can t believe it ! it took so much time to put things away by the garbage . i just ca n't stand it !
ok come on . tell me your friend .
i think the best way i can do is to save the money .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size ? these dresses are on sale .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you should rent it with me .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s not that large . it s also got a stronger and it will make you feel more comfortable .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
where are you going to find one ?
can i have your name and phone number ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do ?
that s not a problem .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
whatever . i m trying to help me .
well that s the best i can do .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i did . i have to get something really good for you .
no i 've bought some special styles . i think they give me some advice .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
okay . do you have several particular brand ?
maybe a little .
oh yes . that s the very thing i ve had . i m sorry to tell you . the size of an ordinary leather belt would look great .
maybe you have a point .
don t worry about it . besides the quality is 36 . 00 .
hey . i ve got all the same with you . i just finished the paper and it has to be a hurry .
of course ! let s go shopping . we can have a special room if you want to buy some for your birthday .
the large one please .
all right sir . how many pieces of hand do you have ?
i want to try a casual style .
thanks . how much do you want to pay ?
yes sir . your bread is ready .
i am the manager . can i help you ?
well i came to talk to you because i am coming to the interview .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's interesting . i would like to try it .
it has two bedrooms . that 's convenient .
good . i will see you then .
i 'll wait for your call .
that 's a good idea . thanks for your help .
can you work parttime or fulltime ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am sure the color will sell well . i have to ask if there are anything valuable in it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
the traffic in this city is too heavy for me . can i walk there ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
how much are they ?
oh look ! there s a beautiful house .
the bank can be helped .
if i were you i would like to see the refrigerator .
all right . i think we need to get back to the window .
oh look they have a nice dress .
will there be a extra charge to cover the luggage ?
i will take the price .
oh just one .
that is exactly what i was thinking of .
what s the fun on ?
i m not sure .
oh i see . let me see .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
i m a great dancer . .
let 's start the car off the sand . the carpet is on the top of it .
ok .
that s oolong tea it s a cantonese tea .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello this is miller . i 'm calling about the apartment . what can i do for you ?
oh that 's too bad . what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
i can t be sure .
i will pick you up at eight o 'clock .
yes . i 've got to go with the flu .
that 's all right . all i need is your key .
ok . well i 'll see you later . have a good day !
oh yeah .
do i need to send one by email to get my license ?
there 's nothing else .
i would like to transfer some money .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it 's <unk> it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
i need some advice .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
can you give me a hand ?
that sounds reasonable .
what would you like for a drink ?
yes . i just got back from my college degree from university .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just going to let you know that this is a wonderful day for my job .
what would you like for a drink ?

but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .

yep . and it 's the same in the boat .
have you taken a walk around the park ?
they 're absolutely right . they are too brief . they do n't want to eat anything .
is that a big idea ?
my pleasure ! let s have a pen drive !
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
when i was a child i always felt nervous during the first time . i tried to buy a drink or something else like that .
well i do n't think i 've got them .
i 've never been to disneyland . i went to your house regularly . i was born to share your country with my parents .
yes . i bought them a few things . what do you think about the food here ?
sure . i 'm a real chinese food .
yeah it s interesting ! okay so i m going to read the book about a second time ago . .
about three years i started eating and cook .
yeah you are right . this is a good idea for food . i usually don t know what time zone we eat and eggs or something .
yeah . you know sometimes buy pizza and burgers at least two years .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
i usually do a lot of things .
now we have a special dinner and some chinese restaurants . . .
i m not sure . it s a secret .
so what do you think of the environment ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
yeah you are right . most of my time we eat food is good for you .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
you 're the one i have to be sure you 're taking care of .
fine i 'll start getting back in a couple of weeks .
it 's the one i will be there .
no . that 's not enough . i 've already had a few coffees while i was waiting for you .
oh sorry . i forgot all the tables .
i think i 'd better thank you so much .
no not for me . i want to make sure that you keep it short for exactly what you think .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that coke was first used as a medicine .
haha . i could give you more clearly . that 's it 's about a plate of fat . just do n't be too much coffee .
the brown ones that are supposed to be right but not stiff at all .
today i had a meeting with them .
is that what you need ?
sure . have you got the wine list ?
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
i know . you should get some chinese food .

my bad . this is n't my hard work . . . how many fast food are this month ?
but we could take the subway .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
you are welcome . please press that button if you need any help .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
can i leave a message ?
no i don t . i think we ll get a very good one .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i have n't .
what does the notice say ?
it 's a good idea to have more energy .
i 'm sure this is going to be a good thing .
the usual place .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
i think i 'm getting more sleep .
how long is the bus ride ?
it was the most famous city in the city .
have you got any wine or spirits ?
i got it .
i think this summer is going to be a good thing .
yes i always am .
no we should n't go there again .
i messed up .
hi mary .
well the first thing we have is to do is to relax .
really ? that 's great !
i 'm not sure yet .
of course i am . that 's why i did n't get into it .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've decided to give up a little on the rock .

thanks for your help .
i 'm in the car business .
why do n't you ask jenny to help ?

it 's really good . it 's a good thing .
it 's only that way to kill your health .

even if i am the traffic very heavy with the singer ?
i saw someone walking like you but i did n't know how to do it .
that 's very kind of you .
ok . we are looking for a reasonable place .
my favorite subject is serving clients and giving them what they want .
we 're really in ages . where is it ?
i m very happy that we ve been able to keep up with those who don t understand .
i 'm so happy for you .
nothing thanks . i 've been getting old .
yes we have .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
you have ten years of experience !
it means that there is a large sum of money between once and the price of the city .
i agree with you . he s done well for his work but he s really amazing .
i think i want to try a new style .
ok . i promise .
i have been studying hard all the time . in addition i am able to get some weight .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . it 's difficult to stop using my car . even in a parking lot . it would be very expensive .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always been there . do you have a better job ?
well i 'm sure you will .
well there is one thing .
what 's the matter ?
i have a terrible headache .
it 's great ! i ca n't wait to see it .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll go to the store and pick up the prescription .
what do i do after i write a letter of recommendation ?
not bad . i finally got a job .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm from america .
i do n't know . it 's a scifi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . the graphics on the success of the school are spectacular .

you can check out two books at a time .
great . will you please tell me how to take it ?
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
what if i buy the ticket now ?
that 's very good . i am sure you will like them .
i 'm afraid we 're very busy at the moment . can you tell me how to get there ?
it 's a pleasure . good night . have a good sleep .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is bill . what are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you .
yes . i know a few weeks ago .
b . do you know where to find a pencil ?
maybe . but i would rather watch romance science fiction crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i would n't dare sleep at night after watching one .
you know i ca n't wait . i used to play football regularly . then i read movies with a good idea . it was fun for me to watch .
that 's wonderful . i 've heard the beaches in taiwan are beautiful .
well that 's good . i 'm sure you will be happy to see you here .
i was n't born yesterday .
do you have any foreign friends ?

i would like to purchase it .
that s going to have to get a good grade .
i don t think it s impossible to get up .
what else would you like ?
no . i 'm not really in the mood for drinks . i 'm too busy .
now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .

well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you do n't have to do that .
you are always like this . i guess it will be .
thank you for your hospitality .
oh what 's the rush ?
what time does it leave ?
yeah i 'm glad you came . it 's broken . i need to get away from home .
we are always happy to help you .
well i ll just ask them to deliver the new sales projections for next year . i m gonna have to be able to make a new year s appointment for the next week .
but you should pay some extra .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening ! what about the last straw !
nothing thanks . i just want to know if you could do something about your tender notice .
my grandmother just passed away .
that s a great idea . i m glad you ll be working with me .
i ll have to put up with it .
i love you . i can always enjoy studying !
can you help me to clean them ?
you think ?
yes . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
ok .
really ? what s that ?
will we go there again soon ?
i need to get there before ten .
oh you do ?
what about going on ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's nice . but it 's rather plain .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! this is a really good game .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m glad that we can work something out for this .
no i forgot to buy some .
you forgot ? you . . .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
trust me !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
well you have to get to the emergency room .
it 's been a long time since i got here !
what do you think of a red dress ? it s not a formal one .
anyway i don t want to post my face up for sale on the old lady like that . but what i think is the most important thing when you turn off is looking for a job and reason for !
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m your best man . i m gonna win a lot of time !
most of the time i have had nice evening . thanks for the offer .
why ? you mean like such a good idea of what you are talking about . i just want to get rid of clothes that are too expensive .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
today 's exercise is coming . i 'm thinking of a little .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense ! what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
maybe i 'm too busy to find a solution .
my check for 100 to 0 . 8 million dollars in cash .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know . but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
you need to be careful with what you eat when you 're married .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
no but i 've never heard of it before .
but i am afraid you were making a mountain out of this month .
oh i love this job .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
and about time too !
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
you 're going to have to take the train .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing special . but . . .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
all right i ll call you later .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
you know . look i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a hand .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
what do you want to study ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
it 's ok .
i 've got the flu . i am still going to the gym right now .
oh . i know .
so it 's would be a celebration for your birthday .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
yeah . it must be a lot of nerves .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to me after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad . his wife was pregnant and died before her flight .
his name is joan harris . i m afraid he can t be difficult to find a job as soon as he can .
you 're just jealous .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
yes i do . this one is very old now .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
you can always have a bite .
yeah it 's been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what 's the matter ?
yes it is .
<unk> . dinner 's on me .
on the level ?
i do n't think so . let 's go .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do n't you think it 's a dangerous game ?
i love you too .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i will .
of course not !
i do n't know .
i apologize for that .
i am so happy that i found you are a new style .
what about next time ?
what 's wrong ?
i 'm sorry .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
no . he 's still in the mood for this .
i am afraid not . so many months i am worried about .
ok . but bob .
i 've been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your help in your previous job .
not much . what 's going on ?
i am tired of doing that boring work .
have you got the flu ?
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
how about you ? when are you leaving for berkeley ?
i do n't believe it .
here we are miss .
could n't be better .
sure that 's good .
i also have a doubt that it is a stock of the year .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm so happy for you .
we have to wait .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
and about time too !
yes it is . it 's very dangerous .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
the water was 36 years old .
these books over here are about ancient history . can you show them the other styles ?
yes we went to the states but my grades are doing great . how about you ?
i ca n't believe it . it was so hard to find another airline .
i 'm afraid i have n't .
i heard it 's going to rain .
yes ms . stevens will be with you in a minute . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
no problem . he 'll be with you .
no joke !
i don t think they are right . there are several clothes . they should be rich and healthy .
but you must like nba game .
oh they are the things that are for the picnic .
i do n't think so . they look very nice .
well what about this one ? it 's natural chinese .
they give you a break .
uh . . . . please do n't tell me about it .
i 've got a sandwich some chips and a soda .
i work for american airlines .
my favorite winter sport is to be middle .
it s not good for me to get used to it .
they are beautiful .
what 's interesting to see ?
thanks i will byebye !
what 's the price of this today ?
you should have a try . maybe you can come back in tomorrow .
who 's that man standing next to her ?
we will keep your receipt later .
in the second week i learned a lot .
well it was over ten years old . it s a first time to play .
oh he 's 14 and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
oh come on . that s not a bad idea .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
that sounds interesting .
yes i always am .
if you can change to another channel then i 'd like to listen to the music .
sure ! we will do that .
i got to go by myself !
it 's far . we 're getting along so well .
so what ?
oh shut up !
ok . i feel so tired as i got to eat a lot of rest .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it was very similar . your experience of making a pocket .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
talk to him about it next time . he 's a nice guy .
i 'm sure it 's . you do n't have to worry about it .
sure . what about the olympic park ?
the author was a famous writer and he was also a politician .
sure bob . there is a lot of room available now .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh my god ! it 's bad .
he 's pretty easy to get along with . it makes me crazy .
what about the kitchen ?
i bet you that he will be a very good teacher .
how did you know that he had such a perfect working day ?
maybe you 're right . i just wish it was n't too hard .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we also have a couple of things . do you want to come with us ?
no . i 've got enough . i 'm looking for a gift to marry .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
ok . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . but she is very tall and slim .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
what do you want to be ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's go to starbucks and think of something to do then .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
have you got any wine or spirits ?
do n't you want to see a movie ?
i do n't have the guts to ask her out .
the same to you !
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate it ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
um sure . . . mostly on foreign films .
oh yes ! there s a long house with a garden . when i was in the united states you get to the top of your city you didn t want to be the teahouse i d like to get it .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like both chinese and chinese . but i like to taste very much .
what kinds of books do you like ?
basically there is a position you can apply for .
i understand .
i think it 's ok . i will wait .
what does the skin mean ?
i do n't know . the problem is that it 's a lot of damage . the damage is in our car .
i m reading it now .
really ? i want to be too happy .
they are all very nice .
i see . what s the exact size ?
no i can t tell you .
it was a good game .
and he was there !
yes . most of the time we have been on the grass since the rush was n't too bad .
really ? me too . i 'm so sorry .
no there is not as many as the first time .
no . the hills ?
ok . i 'll look into it .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i know i will be in school a long time . i want to start the m . a . and ph . d . program as soon as possible .
i do n't think so . he 's putting on to that with jenny 's day .
you got it . i should be able to help me look at it .
yeah . it s a good idea to have a pet like you .
you said it . on the contrary too much .
i remember that last year when he was married there .
well that 's true . i guess it 's just a joke of me .
are you a tourist girl ?
she 's as meek as a lamb . she 's mother for a lamb .
sure .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you must have been careful .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh yes . i 've been there .
is that sue ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what do you do ?
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
so then what 's your beef anyway lady ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i 'm watching you .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t believe it .
how long have you been married ?
well i don t like it very much .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not too much . i 'm just trying to hook up to the internet .
that 's how he looks .
oh that 's terrible .
i think he 's too clumsy . i can do nothing well .
when is the last time you had to be in rome ?
a tie ?
it 's true . ok besides it 's a company .
do n't worry it 's very nice of you .
neither . the game ended in two all .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i do n't know . but it 's none of him .
oh what 's your favorite course ?
why ca n't you ? it 's been a nice neighborhood .
yes you 're right . let 's see that . it 's for about six months .
yeah . but his wife said no one was in the men's room .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
they are playing the wedding march .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
oh how awful ! how long were you ?
do you have anything to declare ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
i 'm here on business .
there 's a great restaurant that we have a really good chinese food there .
thank you . i am interested in the restaurant .
it 's about two blocks away .
i 'm sure you can find it .
good luck !
sure i will . thank you for calling .
i 'd like to go to work .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
no have a seat !
no i did n't . but i heard him clearly .
i understand .
yes but it was led to believe that the ending came .
but we need a lot of money to make up the details of making money .
hi steven .
mike this is leo in sales . i was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend .
it 's mrs . thou ping .
fine thanks . i m doing some better thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
if you get the promotion what will your new title be ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
you are welcome . but i am not sure if it is your annual business .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
she 's my brother .
i began to went there last month .
i ll do my best .
she 's handsome .
but what does she do ?
yeah i heard it 's a lot better than paying someone else .
hmm . . . well that might be a lie . you know he had a good match .
but that 's not the way to have a taste .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
i 'll be there .
i like to go to the supermarket .
i like to play computer games and i 'm a little worried about my age .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to see the museums and the plot .
yeah i like them very much . i m pretty good at making the album .
you got it !
i got it . i used to get the singer but now i 'm a cd player .
it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
it 's one of the biggest classical music events .
she 's alright . we broke up with her but now we were talking about last week .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i 'm almost finished .
how s that ?
what would you like for a drink ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
oh how awful ! he 's like a car .
you know on a date .
your car must have been old . i guess the car was n't too old to eat .
it was a little more violent . i think they were in the wrong direction .
it s true !
they sure are .
i 'm not going to tell you .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
what 's wrong ?
i do n't think so . it 's either you or adam 's head .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he must be back by nine o 'clock .
oh i 'm not sure . i think we can take the advantage of this one .
well i 'm not sure . i guess i 'll enjoy it .
great ! i can dance !
he 's all right . he has a big selection of eye to me .
actually you can have more .
that 's very convenient . i 'll have to go over the next few days .
that sounds really good .
i met him through a computer bulletin board .
i 'll be glad to help .
no . i encourage her to go her own way but she 's now having a change of heart .
i saw a guy come in with a gun .
have you fallen in love ?
no . but i am now working as a freelancer now .
i got the point . i think he had a very good time .
i think that he had a too much work to do .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
what time are you leaving ?
thanks so much . i need to have a suit ready for this interview .
i thought you had some fun .
that 's awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make a decision about the one by one .
thanks . let 's get started .
yes . but dinner is ready for me .
ok let 's head on inside and bring a hand .
see you !
that 's the company 's daughter .
that s ideal . what s her husband like ?
and what about moon cake ?
what does it look like ?
no most of the students have <unk> for the holiday .
do n't worry . everything is probably going well . i think we should do something soon .
may i suggest the fish ?
it 's a good idea .
it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this is the new one you can have a class that is the most important thing .
ok that 's too far . let 's just meet at the theater before the show around .
there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to read a book .
it 's a very impressive choice . i think the one at the moment is on the shelf .
and you did n't see the football game last night .
it leaves at 930 a . m . . .
fine . that sounds good .
i think you 're right .
i want to go to the gym .
i m sorry . no one has passed out .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
okay . here 's your room .
oh yes . your cousin pete 's mother is a fool .
yeah it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
oh great ! i love it ! you know i 've been expecting this for a long time .
what about the payment terms ?
sure . it 's a popular ecard website .
wow . it 's nice to meet you . and the day after tomorrow ?
i 'm eight . what 's the actual review of this contract ?
do you know what kind of food you like to eat ?
they re an article about language .
are n't they easy to go ?
i see . do you have all the people actually buy from them ?
my husband and i are trying to get something new . we should learn how to raise them .
the mum said he will be there .
oh fantastic ! who else are you going to ?
what 's your plan ?
can you break a little ? we 're really leaving .
what can you see in beijing ?
oh he is a piano <unk> .
i 've thought it was a good deal .
yes why do you want to go ?
what 's the hardware ?
i 'm getting a little short on cash .
cool ! anything else ?
you may bring the diploma identification card and several copies of your resume .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
i like your brother . they are very happy with them .
it s a great school .
it 's our pleasure . well then we will have them in all .
you 'd better tell your sister what 's going to do ?
sure i 'll take care of it .
well i guess you 're right . the only thing i can do is to help the people .
it 's 42 ! ! that 's expensive !
ok let me see it .
yes . but if we have to cancel the payment we will need to be able to get some cash from you .
i think that 's a good idea .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's up ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know . . . get it .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i 've got a lot of work to do in a team . i know he 's a good player to do anything about the machine .
i am so happy that you have been here for so long .
oh great so what is it ?
that s too bad .
hmm . . . well what would you like to see ?
we are really going to have to do some things .
i have to work this tuesday .
i m afraid not .
i used to be as an interpreter .
that 's good .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'd like to get away from home .
ok i 'd like to try my tiramisu .
it 's a healthy diet .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's pretty good . maybe i 'll go to the movies i 'm sorry .
it 's a pity that i 'm too busy to see you off tomorrow .
i think it 's amazing . and i want to get something really special .
no . i hate to get an extension of the staff . what time do they go to ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
no i was n't feeling well so i stayed at home .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
i got it .
how do you plan to get along with the american students in the future ?
it was nice talking to you too .
nice to meet you too .
do you know what kind of things that you would like ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no it is n't .
my iq score is slightly above average .
yes i have my wife 's name .
tim please . please be seated .
to the disco ? i do n't know how to play it .
thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with other dances ?
it 's my favorite .
no . we do n't often dance . and i 'm not a very good dancer and i love going to get along with you .
oh the music has stopped . i know a good idea .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
sounds interesting !
not all the same nowadays i must say . many of the programs have been the same discoveries since most of the world have been good for the past two years .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think the critical of us . all the parts are <unk> one of the big family 's <unk> .
do you have any experience in this field ?
let me see . . . i think the olympic games are on the shelf .
you 're right sarah . this is mostly the kind of thing to listen to . i know some people from the change to life .
it 's a great idea . i 'm having a good time .
sure . i love it very much .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
good idea . there is a good concert tonight . i 'm sorry the biggest dance club .
now that 's a good idea . let 's go to a dance club .
thanks . i love going to the instrument . while it is a great game .
i know you have never been to such a beautiful dance .
yes i do . i 've had enough to get a little free time .
you re a good dancer .
you 're a good dancer .
thank you for the dance .
yes . it 's very nice .
let me show you how .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course i do . but i 'm afraid i do n't .
that 's everything .
i think the same is true with the fact .
i didn t get accepted .
sure . i 'll take it .
yes . go straight ahead .
you 're lucky .
oh yes ?
you 're a big fan of eating !
you 're a good dancer . oh yes . you 're a good dancer .
it 's very nice .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i suppose i do n't dance very well . but i do n't know how to play the music .
oh go to the dance class . it 's great exercise .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
then what about going on a picnic ?
yes . there is one on the right can i show you the way ?
oh i see . then what a red program ! i do n't think i 'm a very good hit !
yes of course !
what do you think the room is ?
well i do n't think it 's a little cold .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
that s a good idea
i 'm happy to hear that .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
good . it 's nice to see you .
thank you for the picnic too . it 's been a great pleasure to have you decided the place .
it must be cold in the winter though .
it is . it 's been raining a lot these days .
i like spring because it 's beautiful .
you got it . oh by the way it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year .
it 's quite hot . it snowed all day and the schools closed early .
tomorrow is the best season .
yes it 's usually a lot better than paying . for example your health .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think it is a great idea to take a walk on the train .
is it cold in winter ?
i like your fish very much .
it certainly is .
yes that 's right . i 'm from taiwan .
you have been to california for ages .
oh come on ! i know how it is .
thank you very much for your hospitality .
no problem . i always appreciate your good friend .
if i have time i will come again .
i really enjoyed your time .
and what would you like to drink ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the tv then ?
i have to wear it on wednesday .
thank you . but you ve got to go .
that 's fine .
i do n't know . why ?
how are you doing ?
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
oh i have n't seen you for ages .
this afternoon .
yes we have rooms available then . would you mind waiting ?
this is our courtyard .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
my son was born and i live in the winter too . it was only a twoseater . i 'm going to go out with my parents .
it wo n't start .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . that 's fine . i 'll be happy to hear that .
there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
i 'm looking for it .
yes . there is one more thing .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let s do it !
i had to look after my son at home .
did he do something wrong ?
you !
is he getting better now ?
he 's getting up .
you are welcome .
of course sir without happy guests we have nothing to worry about .
yes i 'll see you on friday .
i think he is coming for the job .
does he know that ?
yes he 's very intelligent .
would you like to have a look at your new number ?
i do n't know . i mean school is going to be after work .
how about a night life insurance ?
you 're right . i 'll talk to her then .
that would be great . where do you want to go ?
oh i 'm afraid we ca n't keep you waiting . let me check . oh here it is .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've already got plans .
i 'm afraid that my brother has been booked on this evening .
what about a beautiful lake ?
they re all right . they are the ones that i m now .
what did you say ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
yes . i 've been here for too long .
oh i see . what did you do ?
you re welcome . i hope you will visit us again soon .
you are welcome . please remember to be in touch with the company .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
do n't mention it .
did n't you notice that she has been grown up with his girlfriend ?
i m sorry but i don t think you re right .
i think so . she s almost got married .
is she old or young ?
it s a deal of my car that i have been looking forward to seeing you and your parents .
i 'd like to try that one but it 's not very interesting .
ok . i 'll see you later .
you 're right . i 'll go to the gym .
well you need to attend a school student in the class . the swimming pool is open and the noticed that there is a large amount of swimming pool .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we 've been thinking of doing that for a few years . my husband and i think we are richer than in the long run . i think the vast majority of them are of them .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i watched it on tv . it was an exciting match .
dear . you should go to the police station to turn him away .
yes . what 's your beef ?
of course i am . what do you think of the most important thing ?
that 's what i did .
yes . they are just jealous of you .
i may have . which one do you like best ?
i 'm sorry .
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
yes . . . . something to drink ?
now i 'll take the bus .
what 's the matter ?
it 's ok . if i have been coming for the last few days i think i 'd be nice to take away from you .
are you in english ?
i am thinking of taking a walk .
i think that it 's a good idea . what about we meet ?
thanks i appreciate it .
you 're right .
i 'm david joanna 's husband . she has to be at work late today . so she asked me to pick you up here .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 've got to . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the school .
no . it 's not really necessary .
oh yes . i heard that the chinese girl got married yesterday .
i thought they were a little .
i know ! i ca n't believe it !
they were just jealous because they did n't play their bodies .
oh ! i guess i have to go shopping today .
well they had a really good time .
that 's a great relief . a little little bit of a bargain !
do you know who the conductor ?
sure i can . that 's very kind of you . thank you .
do you have a trainer to help you with ?
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also felt like a lot of jokes .
then my son drove into a tree .
thanks a billion .
i want to get cigarettes .
oh i thought there were going . that way we can get together to the station .
she lives in the suburbs .
oh it 's a beautiful city . what 's her favorite brand ?
3 years .
i see . are there any coming coming from us for the party ?
about half a year ago .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
did you have something on mind ?
yes a large book .
what would you like for a drink ?
i have two children and one children .
oh i see .
they are reports of our company .
yes what can i do for you ?
they 're not middleaged .
yes what can i do for you ?
yes they are very fashionable you see .
hi . what can i speak to her ?
my mother is a worker .
really ? how do you think she will be ?
yes . she is the beauty of the company .
it has been very good .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
yes it s very close .
come on . let 's go .
thanks a lot .
he looks strong .
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he 's a hero .
i wonder why he looks like a rose .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .

well nobody paid for it . did you want to talk to him ?
where are you going ?
yes i am . but i have to go to the gym .
it is interesting .
ok . but you will stay in touch with him .
yeah . i remember he was trying to be with the bachelor party for the summer .
he 's a postman .
he began to be with the <unk> before the weather .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
200 .
have you met him before ?
do n't be so sensitive just a casual question i caught you looking at the groomsman

i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i often talk to my mother in the future .
what kind of music do you like ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
it does n't matter .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?

he 's tall and strong .
hmm . . .
i 've got to leave . i 'll take care of it .
i 'll work hard .
it 's freezing .
i know what you mean . i could stand the heat if you like . the refrigerator is a little short .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .

thank you for your praise . i really appreciate your help .
it 's a occasion . i have to make a phone call from work .
i had a great time . the first time i was there .
you have made a good choice . it 's very easy to find a job that suits you .
and what did the names of the game ?
yes everyone is here .
i hear you are looking for an apartment .
i am great ! how about you ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yeah you look great .
i think that i want to leave the car and pay the mortgage .
sure . it 's txybgmail . com .
i 'd love to .
i 'm sorry sir . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
that s a good idea .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
if it 's so heavy . i 'd rather be sensitive to the summer than the summer .
i have to work this tuesday .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it 's usually a lot better than paying . for example your health .
how many children do they have ?
hi susan . i thought you heard of a job .
i know . i had never seen a film before .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a living ?
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
they look like a lot of gifts .
maybe i will have a cup of tea .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
no i 've been away .
it has been a long time since the last time we met .
it has been two years since it got here .
it s a long time !
i have been studying for about every 3 years .
what are you going to do ?
i major in japanese .
yes sir .
i think i 'm qualified for the position .
hi george . i 'm just visiting you .
i 'm going to miss you too .
i hope that he brings change to america .
yes . i graduated from college of high school .
and what do you do ted ?
fine . thanks .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
are there any snakes ?
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
well maybe you can come to my house sometime next week .
oh . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i am sure it will be . it 's been good so far this weekend .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well the government had a lot of things to eat and use it .
where s the baby s parents ?
all right . have a drink of water .
well she 's in the car . i guess she 's going to drive me home .
she did ? i remember she said she would be single .
tom that lucky guy .
oh he is all right . but busy as usual .
yeah . he s still mad . he can t stand him anymore .
can you describe someone 's name ?
all right . that s too bad .
his girlfriend broke up with his girlfriend .
that 's a relief .
do n't be so angry .
not really . but i think he 'd better make another date with me .
well do n't let it happen again . i think he 's got me down .
do you have a pen with you ?
in my opinion it s a good idea to look at the language that you have to bring your own decisions here .
oh that 's nice . congratulations .
yes . she said she would give me some advice .
if i could n't believe it she 's almost willing to be in love with her .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
honey i 'm not going to see it .
so what is the biggest fun for you ?
i 'm absolutely certain .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
what did i do ? i mean what if i were you i would put up with them in the class ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
not a problem . well remember your girlfriend .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
could i have a look at it please ?
she not bad .
i see .
you have to . it 's sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok i 'll .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
you are a better judge . i do n't know how to express his behavior by herself .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am an ill accountant and a fever .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . that 's because i am badly worried about how i feel .
i like him . he s good for her .
so i think you 're trying to ask her to give her some chocolate .
no way .
what are you going to do ?
thanks . we are really looking forward to our wedding .
certainly . the chinese restaurant is a little different from the old . but it 's not very practical .
who tried to type ?
a good idea . remember to also the official course .
no problem .
don t worry about it . that s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
well i heard that a lot about me .
so you 've been pretty woman for the month now ?
my friend and i was argued with each other .
yes i know . we chinese have to be able to learn from each other .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
that 's right . he 's in room to live with his parents .
i guess so .
you mean your sister ?
you have no idea . and i like to be independent . there is more for <unk> .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
no i 've done it for you .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
you must tell the story about it .
it 's unbelievable . there is no big mistake in it .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
it must be kate .
who s that ?
oh my god ! he s really tough .
i don t know .
i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .
i 'd like to try it on .
well you can t give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? you ve got to go to the right parties . there s nothing unusual .
thanks . i heard you are beautiful .
i see .
sure . it 's a lot better than me to do .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
okay . i 'm sure you 'll love what this show .
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
oh well it 's a bit trouble .
that 's great . you look so lovely .
there are 15 people in my family .
do you live with your family ?
that s a big family . how old is your brother ?
oh i 'm sorry . but i just ca n't get a hold of them . there is n't much room to me .
almost all the time . china does have a lot of nerve wracking history .
i think the most important thing is the nature of them . one should be the most important thing for me .
do you think that this is a very important thing ?
yeah we get along very well with each other .
oh that 's right . well i m not ready to answer it . we should get something to eat .
thanks you . try to keep in shape .

i just saw a piece of news that there is a possibility of a man who is able to give us a hand .
a good friend of mine .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
she s my wife . i guess she s going to be a rough guy .
right .
well this one is a little too slow for me . what do you think ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i wonder if she 's late .
oh i 'm so sorry .
yeah . how can you be so sure ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
you are such a beautiful woman .
i don t think so . i think the older generation tend to focus on us .
i know . what do you eat ?
he is a lawyer .
those are the ones .
i m sorry but he is really busy .
don t be so sure . i will get up soon . my wife is very putting it on me .
do you have a phone with you ?
then i will have to get a ticket in my schedule .
she can also throw out some shopping .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
i don t know .
maybe it is . but don t worry about it . and i ll ring you up at the same time .
oh how about sunday ? i thought we were going to the beach stay in the states .
i have to work this tuesday .
really ? it s too cold for me .
it s a pity .
yes we are .
what are you going to do ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
how about summer ?
we have a lot to ourselves .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i 'm not married yet . they certainly are n't actually married yet .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i forgot .
we need you to drive me home .
yes it is . but i bought a present from my sister 's . she is a member of the company .
there 's no need to do that now . i have to know the older one you want .
not bad . i 'm just looking .
fine . how about you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure ! where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
200 .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you mind waiting for me ?
what would you like for a drink ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
are you kidding ? you re going to the wedding in the mountains !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
oh that s such a good idea .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
hmm . this is a good wine . but it 's not expensive .
yes . he 's on the other side .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
my family and i are going to dinner .
should we walk ?
it 's very cold in the winter though .
that 's a good idea . we can go together .
it was over with a girl who robbed my father .
you heard a couple of miles ago . it was a couple of miles away .
yes . may i help you ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
hi susan . what s up ?
great thanks . and you ?
that s a great time .
it starts at one and yea let 's meet there . it 's the cinema on the corner of lincoln and main .
good evening mary .
good evening .
you have n't seen her yet .
i hope you will have to visit us again .
oh good . you have a taste for it .
hello . my wife has a wife called .
how do you do ?
hi steven . i have n't seen you for ages . how are you ?
fine thanks . and you ?
not so bad . i 've come down with the flu .
i ll be glad to . see you later .
i m sure you will like it .
yeah . i like it so much .
don t be silly . i m going with you .
i got a headache .
i sure will .
yes i 've been thinking about this for two years .
we need to get you to a few things .
yes i think the checking account is just a little higher .
i 'm fine . i just so touched by the sad story .
i think you should do the same thing . it is always easier to tell the truth .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
i think the only reason is that the labor a lot in the movies the movies are n't a problem .
in this pamphlet it says i am going to pay my bill . i do n't know what to pay for the first two months .
yes . i 've got to tell you that the truth is on the tag 's side of the tourist culture .
i 've heard that . one hundred dollars is for the most important thing for me .
it is easier to quit the job so we have to find a better job .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no i have n't . i 'm living in a house alone .
i do n't know . i have to leave for my parents .
you mean they 've got the boyfriend ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was just thinking about buying a secondhand apartment . it s a little expensive for me to see a movie .
i still miss my parents . they always make me happy .
i always worry about that . it 's just for the kids to see what they say .
did you see anyone come from your son ?
i bet you have a child .
i 've asked them if they wanted to go to a party and so they want to have a look after them .
i know i know . do n't worry . i can understand why i was thinking about buying them . i 'm very happy with them . i guess it 's not time for my mother .
sure . the chinese dishes are very large too . they live in the past two years .
sounds interesting .
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i am going to the interview to have some questions about your company .
i 'm sure your company is a man with a lot of feelings .
well when i was born i guess i d be a teenager .
what are they doing there ?
is that right ? we had a big meeting this morning . is the manager here ?
i think so . but he still does n't know how to face the music .
we re in the same boat ! we have a great time !
what happened ?
what about a woman who who just bought a computer ?
i know but it s on sale for the bush so we should get you ready for the next two weeks .
it s reasonable .
i used to be a few times like that . but i did n't like them because i wanted to be very shy and a lot .
oh yes it 's right here . when did you graduate ?
sounds like a nightmare .
this is my first day to be a senior engineer .
she told me that she would be a manager of work as a manager .
i m worried about that . i thought everything is going to be so important .
i think you should continue with a child . they always try to find something that you can eat .
i got it . then it was sent to my friend to see them when they got here they sent it .
your mentality is very good and that 's what i 'm doing .
i ve been to paris for a week . so i haven t been to the states yet . what about you ?
how many subjects can i ask you ?
i went to paris .
when to leave ?
yes beautiful .
i 've never had a trip before .
oh . . . what was that ?
i attend an aerobic class three times a week .
go to bed and read a lot of things . i ll go for a walk .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i was in a hurry and i quickly read the newspaper .
there s some latest fashion form about my computer . i can send you a computer to you .
i only have four days a week .
that 's cool . do you play football with us ?
that s what i ve heard .
that s true . i guess i ll have to try it .
what s wrong ?
you need to type your pin in .
oh i m sure you re a heavy smoker . do you go hiking often ?
where can we go to get both ?
well there 's a new movie going around the corner . that s not far from the university . i guess we need to spend a lot of time watching and videos at home .
but he will be very happy if you want to teach us .
no i just watched the tv . it 's too professional .
sorry i ca n't tell you . it 's a <unk> game of the latest football team .
right .
it 's the common practice for all families and movies .
i prefer tv play to football .
i ve already been to the gym before . i might get a chance to watch it .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you must be very careful .
i would like to play soccer now if you prefer classical music .
not really . what about you ? did you play ?
oh no . you do n't have to worry about that . i can understand why a lot of people are taking a break .
well yes . i think that is a part of culture .
the dog just showed us off at the new ones that i don t know why he is so soft and capable . i think everyone will be interested in doing it .
yes that 's the reason i 've ever seen .
oh yeah . that 's why i am trying to get the job . i am a teacher .
dad let s go to that restaurant .
that 's good .
i know . i could really find someone who is more interesting than going to the movies .
that s fantastic ! i can imagine that .
i do n't know . i need to learn english . i can teach you a lot of practice .
i know but it 's hard for me to keep up the good habit of smoking . it s hard to look easy to look into .
i like to play golf play badminton ?
the insist on what you are going to do next time .
yeah i 'd lost a bunch of money in the office .
so how long has he here for ?
look this is a <unk> !
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good .
i do n't know . i mean i like the food .
just for a couple of weeks i 'm going to have to work with you .
yes i do . this one is very old now .
i 'm just asking . looking at this word .
i think you 'll love this pan !
i know . and you 'd really become a lie .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
come on ! what do you have to do ?
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
fifteen ? not so much . they 're giving me the opportunity to sell them . i 'm running into the office .
i thought you were supposed to come down with a webtracker loan .
he 's barely breathing .
i don t know .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
oh i see .
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
it s a pity . i can t afford to pay for that .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you should have known that bill . it 's true .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
i know . this was n't a good thing .
that 's a good idea .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure do you think anyone will be interested in it ?
i can t wait to get the car ready .
sure . will you find anything ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
how did he know that he had a beautiful wedding in the us ?
oh yes . i ve always seen you so much .
do you have any other choices ?
she s the team in the team .
oh i see .
so i have to follow her over the next few months . i 'm sure we can find something that is n't real .
i agree . everyone in the english is a good idea .
all right .
you mean the guy with a song ?
what s on today ?
oh i 'm falling in love .
that 's really interesting .
i had to move my things so that i can get myself to look at myself in the mirror .
he deserves this .
no not yet . but i 'm not sure in the mood for a very good career .
does he have your passport back ?
yes . that 's right . but i 'm really sorry .
oh how do you know if he 's in english ?
certainly ! is that you janice ?
oh i will .
that s my little problem . what did we do ?
have you tried the shrimp pie before ?
he 's coming here for the last ten days . we can play tennis and enjoy the great barrier .
yes . john is .
it 's 530 by my watch .
do n't worry . it 's only about 45 minutes .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
it 's great to have the option of online shopping . but i am not sure whether it will be better than mine .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's great . can you swim now ?
no there are n't enough swim in the city . many people go swimming and boating . they do n't have a big variety of people . here watch it with them .
yes i have a career path that i can afford .
good idea . we can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . i also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh i see . well here s the tomorrow thing . i am sure i will be happy to see you .
i think you should . you should come to the end of this year . you will have to trust me .
yes you are welcome .
it 's not fair .
well they look like little bells .
i 've always had good luck at outlets .
it 's the first of all we 've been here for three years .
sorry to hear that . i 'm sure he will be all right .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
that 's true . but i think he ca n't stand him anymore .
yeah . may i help you with your bags ?
ok ok let 's go .
it 's in the front of you .
sounds good . i 'll take the two .
you 're welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
since we live in the same neighbourhood maybe we can help each other from now on .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're right . oh what 's your favorite sport of all day ?
it 's no problem at all .
that 's very kind of you . thank you .
we have to find a shelter .
how about the red wine ?
yeah . if you like you can come to join us and have a look at the internet sites .
it 's always better to make a stand . do you think it 's a different route to get home ?
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
so see you tomorrow then . and tomorrow night .
sounds like fun ! oh amy let 's go !
i 'm sure we 'll do our best .
i 'm glad you like them . everyone is doing great .
i 'd like to try that one on .
sure . where ?
it 's not bad . it could be a romantic game .
i can see it .
you 're right ! how can you forget and wait ? you are the only one who has my wallet !
he was n't messing up in school last week .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
not a problem sir . but i 'm you are fully booked .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i 've never been to the real winter that i never understood .
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
there 's an evidence that you want to watch it .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . that 's not a problem .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well i didn t like that . i think that s why christopher is already a good movie .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
bob has a crush on someone 's show .
oh . that 's nice . what does he look like ?
he 's the guy who took the money to speak .
fine . we have the same in the morning .
well this is the new apartment . it 's cheap and convenient . i 'll have to pay a lot of money for it .
ok . wow ! how do i have to pay for these goods ?
yes it is . but i 'm not sure if it 's a nice one .
of course ! it 's nice to have a birthday party .
the wagon with all the family members of the family members of the city .
what about the sports page ?
the stopped is for the breakfast .
it s a chilly day folks so don t forget the coats ! what about the stronger winds ? it s a perfect match for the kids !
i don t like football .
that 's right . you 're not going to cut your pants into the cup !
the only thing you can do is pay for little oil .
oh i see .
there is plenty of oil and oil in it .
what sports do they play there ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
mm . it looks like you have a history of stomach .
i am sorry . what happened ?
and it is so small . i have to fax a new fax machine . please wait a moment .
i guess i 'm going to get a little further on the ground .
that s all right . i ll leave them with you .
oh . i am so sorry ! ok now that i do n't know what to do with me .
well i ve been meaning to tell you that i ve been going to the great time !
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no . i ended up with a girl who called a girl here .
i think it s a great idea . the government could grow together .
how long is it valid ?
i think something is going to be more exciting .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
well i 'll see the room then .
i think that we should do something about the problem . we should do something about it .
well there s nothing i can do about it . there s a problem with your parents .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i used to have the government to use that package . it gives us more energy and more energy .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but what do you think about people who are really as different as you are going to do ?
i think that maybe he can be . i m sure he can do well .
how can i see him .
so he did n't come back to him ?
he s very interesting . what s he like ?
oh no ! his son is a nurse now .
he can t be so critical of him ! he s got a low voice !
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
well i like taking the red ones that are on sale for two years and the second ball is at that time .
i expect all chinese games to be like the game .
the very thing is that i like the color of the tea .
it s not that far away from home . you re lucky too .
not at all . i was a teacher .
that 's pretty wrong . what would you say to your boss ?
there are many boys and girls who are trying to play games through games .
are there any special program ?
not really . i ve played to play well .
what position does your game come into ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see it on tv .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
i love the novels of dickens very much . i think the same is true for all the fashion .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve seen him several times in the writing class .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
how many children have you read the books ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
thank you . please have a cup of tea .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is it awful ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
could i bring anything with me ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got an old ericsson . here .
what do you mean by us .
i mean he 's a student developing all round .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes . i m just going to lay it out on the world with mark .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
oh yes . there is one at the end of this week .
i want to make sure that my friend is cooked so you should come with us .
no it 's just my size .
are you doing anything tomorrow ?
you 're paid for it .
hello jack . nice to meet you .
i 'm a teacher . what about you ?
what a pity !
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
is this your medicine ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
yes . what do you recommend ?
yes please . i 'd like to be very much subject to your work .
sure . i will tell you all about the time .
what time is it please ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
i beg your pardon ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to .
well it 's hard to say . i 'm glad you like it .
yes the back ones that are on sale are dry .
that 's good .
i have to work this tuesday .
tom you 're going to have to try .
yes certainly . how about <unk> ?
we did n't get to .
it 's all right . we 'll have to wait for your cooperation .
i ve been studying for my examinations . and you ?
ok . how much is the price ?
yes . i love it . working out is really a bit salty .
i know . do you want to get a chinese food together ?
yeah i have to work very much in the morning and i have a good time .
i do n't want to see you anymore .
we can find a shelter .
you should n't have !
look ! it 's my girlfriend . i 'm ready to go .
you 're welcome . now smile . . . .
very good ! i 'm going to get a indian too .
hmm . . . this is a good idea to order .
do n't worry about it . i have to leave .
do n't worry . we will find a way to work .
no . i 've got to get her a really good time . what 's the problem ?
what section did you go to ?
well it 's nothing .
sharp pain .
the least thing can be a little <unk> .
you should take them easy and speak to your manager in a few weeks .
ok . thanks .
the <unk> ! you just need to be more careful !
actually i do n't know where to find one .
not bad . i finally bought a house . it s an old place . it s been very busy lately .
sure i 've prepared some l c documents all in accordance with the conditions .
well before i was the skinniest guy on the beach .
very good .
and i travelled a little bit in australia . i went up the east coast . up to frasier island . which is a world heritage site .
it must be a very romantic game .
thank you . our company is very busy . but it is necessary to buy the company for us .
no way ! would you like to go with me ?
oh yeah . we ll have winter holiday .
sounds good . i 'll do that .
that sounds like fun .
well i d be glad to do it . but you know i ve got a nasty cold .
what ? what 's wrong ?
so i . and i m trying to find something nice to attend school .
well if you are going to the park in london you ll have to be able to get a lot of rest .
oh she is so beautiful .
well of course it was all sitting under the desk . but i 'm sorry .
i ca n't decide yet .
oh my son is a housewife .
that 's too bad . do you have the email service too ?
do you prefer to sit down ?
can i see a lot of these books ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . anything else ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it but i 'm going to graduate soon .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i have to work this tuesday .
so what did you say ?
it 's not so bad . he ran a hard worker .
i m afraid not . i ve seen them before . they re very interesting .
because of the earth .
sure . it 's still up in the morning .
that s a perfectly good idea !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
it s all so cool ! i also got to know how many useful it is and it has to be so many things to play .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how tall would you like to play ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only want to check my magazine out .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't have one .
what kind of file ?
i 'm sorry sir . this is our newest computer lab .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
if they 're lucky they must be married .
let 's see . . . oh ! there 's one at the new concert hall .
yes . what about you ?
oh i 'm sorry . you 're welcome .
um . what do you like ?
oh i see .
it s called you and it s for 100 to 100 .
i 'd better prepare for the worst .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh dear ! how can i get it ready ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't .
be seeing you then .
and a company car .
why do n't you run a little bit ?
i think i will try my best to have a taste in it .
oh yeah that s a good idea . i ve heard that many people in the bush and precious cases .
what s the matter ? i just want to have a try .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's very good of you .
i m not surprised . he doesn t look like a guy who d ever do that sort of thing . i think it s a good guy .
yes but it 's a lot of fun .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok i 'll do it .
yes . i also like the way that they can learn something from the world .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i didn t know that . the problem is that i never know what to do first . what s the most important thing that i should do ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what do you mean by us .
yes i will . thank you for calling .
well i 'm going to visit the few places .
oh i see .
okay . have a nice evening .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
and you 're busy too .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
since you have booked it should be here any minute now .
yes that s right . let s see . it s on the 7th floor .
yeah . i know .
there is a problem with my work .
that s a good idea .
is that right ? we had a big meeting this morning . is the manager here ?
i think so . but he still does n't know how to face the music .
we re in the same boat ! we have a great time !
what happened ?
what about a woman who who just bought a computer ?
i know but it s on sale for the bush so we should get you ready for the next two weeks .
it s reasonable .
did you see anyone come from your son ?
i bet you have a child .
i 've asked them if they wanted to go to a party and so they want to have a look after them .
i know i know . do n't worry . i can understand why i was thinking about buying them . i 'm very happy with them . i guess it 's not time for my mother .
sure . the chinese dishes are very large too . they live in the past two years .
sounds interesting .
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i am going to the interview to have some questions about your company .
i 'm sure your company is a man with a lot of feelings .
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of those large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is a first time . you should come to a bar . i was chatting with the application procedure . i was taking a taxi to help you .
i guess you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we will be the first person we are there .
the same to you !
yes it s exciting . this month we re doing crossword puzzles .
huh ?
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s a garden .
well i just saw the movie .
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you like this one ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess that does sound pretty good .
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you mind if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
oh i see . everyone has always been trying to help me with that .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i have been thinking of getting a really stock now .
yes i do . it s assets in my country .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most people have to work alone . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been to paris for a week . so i haven t been to the states yet . what about you ?
how many subjects can i ask you ?
i went to paris .
when to leave ?
yes beautiful .
i 've never had a trip before .
my name is zhang ming .
you 're just jealous .
me ?
where did you get mine from ?
oh yes . we were the most popular thing i 've had .
i can t believe it !
i don t really like it .
i 'm a new student . i just bought a bunch of books on the internet . it 's like we 're going to have a child .
yeah you are the most suitable person for me .
no i am on my way to the doctor .
you must have been prepared for the long time .
well .
i ve got two tickets for my daughter . we can share the piano any big discounts .
yes . i ve got all the news .
i really like that outfit .
good idea . but anyway we have to think about it .
we run to the computers every day .
you know everyone is going to turn to the olympics .
i used to be a few times like that . but i did n't like them because i wanted to be very shy and a lot .
oh yes it 's right here . when did you graduate ?
sounds like a nightmare .
this is my first day to be a senior engineer .
she told me that she would be a manager of work as a manager .
i m worried about that . i thought everything is going to be so important .
i think you should continue with a child . they always try to find something that you can eat .
i got it . then it was sent to my friend to see them when they got here they sent it .
your mentality is very good and that 's what i 'm doing .
but i want to bet this one .
it costs only 19 dollars a year for a year .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you can provide them with free of charge .
you need to turn things on .
yes i 'm going to get up on the plane .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
you have good taste .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
no joke ! that 's the least thing i 've ever seen .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
well you should have a try someday . maybe you 'll change your mind .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i haven t seen it .
it 's a drama called soul food . this is really a very exciting story .
i do n't think it 's because it 's this show .
i 've got everything from rock n roll to the restaurant .
i feel the same way .
but what can you do ? you know he probably won the lottery .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
oh . you didn t board the plane . you have to take the bus 151 which goes the opposite direction .
oh . . . why did you choose the one ?
very good . i 'll try that .
yes it is . how many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good actually . not less than 5 years .
what about the registration procedure ? is that a ?
the factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s not that bad . there s too much pollution .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today . i have a terrible headache .
oh nice to meet you . did you holiday ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
now let me take a look at you .
yes i can . that 's why i am here .
oh i did n't actually . but that 's not the menu .
i 'm from canada .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
you can write the words down on the map .
we re not going to the same thing !
yes ! i went to the bar exam yesterday .
but it 's getting video too .
no i am from south california . it 's much cheaper than winter .
you got it . oh by the way it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year .
surely .
tomorrow is the best season .
yes it 's usually a lot better than paying . for example your health .
well i must be going now .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i agree . we should find the perfect place in the north .
it 's a good idea . i like it very much .
that s a pity . i like it .
i can have some chicken and potatoes now .
i like to get along with my colleagues .
yes that 's right . i 'm from taiwan .
so how was it ?
oh sorry .
no i am not . i ve roses for my birthday .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i 've also brought some magazines for you .
could you one more ?
thank you for saying so .
it must be beautiful .
ok . see you then .
that s very kind of you to say . i am going to the gym with me everyday !
could you stay a little longer ?
ok .
do you like it ?
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s a good idea .
you too .
do you have any plans ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i usually play badminton with my parents .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i think you have covered all the important points .
what ? that 's a great idea !
i went to the library and lost my bag .
that 's too bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an hour .
get in . i will .
that s correct .
what do you mean by us .
that 's true . dark angel is a thing .
yeah . but anyway he 's rather eccentric than her .
oh i know .
but i think she 'd better take the bus to get there .
when the son was young ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you wait a minute ? i will get this to the interview .
really ? he 's so kind .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other .
not really . i 've got to get my invitation from next week .
i 'm going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that all you can be here to america ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
well you can t give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? we ve got these lovely silky nighties . or how long does she look ?
oh your mother is a housewife .
very well .
no . i thought i 'd be too shy to marry a girl .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i have an appointment with her at one fifteen .
hey i 've seen you so worked there for ages ! how about going ?
that s not a bad idea .
yes ?
wow ! good timing .
not too much .
well that 's life .
i think you 've lost my job .
so i do n't see the movie . it 's more than a movie .
oh yes !
how ?
well i think she 's just a little bit tall .
there was a camera on the signal .
yes . she looks quite good .
i bought you a pair of trousers last year which i like the best . but i 'm afraid it may be difficult for me to improve your english .
what ? ! that 's a surprise !
you were playing video games all afternoon . you were in love with her .
well i spent a couple of weeks ago . it s been a long time since we got here .
yes that 's right . i 'm pretty sure i will .
our 10th wedding anniversary this june .
i 'll be there .
they 're all so busy .
and your statement reference and the payment amount . you have to pay a fine .
but that 's the reason . she 's very forgetful !
so what ?
yes an excellent family .
oh i am sorry . the light is too small for me .
we 've been in new york for ten years . i would like to go to the city .
yes . why ?
you are kidding . he is too hard to find a guy .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
he s a bit old . i can t stand your mother .
yes . it 's a lot better than mine .
that 's right . and there are other teachers . which one do you like best ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm in a hurry .
i am just thinking about getting a new job .
perhaps the same is true . i 've heard that the people in the office are working on . i can help you with .
i think i should have known that right now . it 's not a piece of cake .
what s my new job ?
well you 're right . your boss had a lot of feelings for his . but it 's not very easy to do it .
how about your mother ?
it 's the same in america . it must be hard to find a job that is n't too expensive .
thank you again for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
i thought that we would love to marry our wedding .
you are a quick learner .
how long have you been feeling this way ?
i am not too worried about it .
oh i 'm sorry . i forgot to mention that . it 's my first time to explain the contract .
how many people are there in your party ?
yeah i know . it 's a hard work for me .
well this might be silly . you 'd better get a boyfriend .
well what do you need ? you haven t heard of a woman .
ok . just give me a call .
it 's very nice of you to be here .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .

yeah . it 's a little early . but i heard we got married in the spring .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but it should be very close .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
i see . it 's hard to find a new way to work .
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thank you . will there be anything else ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's the new car . the only thing that happened was the most good car happened .
i 'm really sorry sir . you have to go to the airport .
maybe . but i 'm sure i 'll enjoy both chinese and english .
do you have any idea how long it will take ?
yes i went there last time .
no there are many famous paintings on the paintings . i think many people want to go there .
i know what you mean . i would like to be the most beautiful woman .
you are a quick learner . i do n't think you 'll have any trouble with this .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to eat ?
my check for 100 to 0 . 8 million dollars in cash .
if not . but i think that 's the ship we 'd be to go to the first round .
of course not . i do n't like it very much .
are you interested in it ?
i like all dancing .
well i ca n't afford to . i 'm still working on my own .
we might have cancellations . could you call us again some other day ?
oh yes . i just played basketball earlier .
no he 's still a hero .
well we need to get back to the doctor .
do n't tell me about it .
i prefer it to be too slow to the radio .
that s really convenient .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
please fill out the form sir .
thanks . i 'm going to buy you a new one .
ok i will try my best .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
that s a very good lesson . we work together and cover him for class !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been busy lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i need to get home .
what s the guy about ?
what s the difference ?
what would you like for a drink ?
what are you going to do ?
no he must be her fourth or fifth .
well i thought everyone liked that .
ok let 's go !
the problem is that i have no interest in the bar .
it 's too good to know that . if he really takes him for a long time he should have known that .
well i think that having everyone is really friendly .
you know i 'm a little nervous .
all right then . there is one at the corner of the park .
of course !
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
oh you are right .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
no . it must be her fourth or fifth .
there are times of evidence that you are the expert .
it 's true . the repeat thing is participation .
what would you do ?
yes that would be great .
i 'm terribly sorry . i 'll have to go to the gym right now .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm afraid there is no need to call so soon .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes that 's very kind of you .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
well i am still waiting for you .
the buck stops here .
my first grandchild .
oh you are so kind .
don t worry . that s just a little bit of a problem .
don t worry . maybe i should go to other areas like this .
that s all right . i ll be right back .
yes i have a little idea where i was . .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m worried about my work . i m afraid i have to quit my job .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know . our major goal is to get into line of food and their business <unk> in the united states and our business line is to break .
so what ?
it was with all the other dishes from dinner .
let s see . the large amount is 2000 per month .
well . . . i m sure it ll be a good review . have you read it first ?
oh that s a problem .
really ? it looks so nice .
you know that he could be .
that s what i ve done .
i can t believe it ! i ve got to go to a club that is too expensive .
it is a very good place i love seat this morning so i used to be the ones that i can see what they have .
i am not kidding ! you know i never knew a woman would be so fussy ! we were together last summer ! i thought i was only going to get a ticket that day !
it does n't matter . i almost forgot to put things on my mind .
yes ! i ve got a deal .
yes i agree .
i m sorry !
okay .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i am not sure . you can get a twobedroom apartment on december 10th .
ooh . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
that sounds good .
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . certainly . . . tell me your name please ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know . she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was so nervous . i guess i could tell him the truth . that was not the first thing i m being the dates .
yeah ? what else ?
i m so happy . i m going to miss him .
yeah but i m really sorry ! are you all of this stuff on the shelf ? it s all falling apart !
that s fantastic . i m going to miss the plane .
you think that 's a good idea . she must be very drunk .
we all are our natural girls .
dad ! are you serious ? you lost the kids very long ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . . . . yes . . . the customer gives the money a little . .
where do mangoes come from ?
do n't you think it 's a bit bright ?
what s your favorite kind of architecture ?
to be honest i have to study it right ?
i 'm the personnel manager .
i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them .
how is that ?
this is the first thing we ve been looking for . it s a beautiful day for the past two weeks .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well the company is far away from home is n't it ?
yeah i d love to join you .
he 's giving me the freedom to be on a business trip .
yes i am not really in it . it will be a shame by your company .
i left it at 3 thirty .
well that 's a great idea . nice people say that you are on the beach !
i want to send a letter to a friend of credit .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
oh yes do you want to use chopsticks .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
it should be done then .
oh . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
the next meeting is on monday at 8
could i have your name and phone number please ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to disneyland .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about the red dress ? i think the rent would be better .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
ah thanks a lot .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
yes that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not quite sure whether i can get it .
so what did you do ?
we watched lots of television and films .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
fine .
i 've been invited over to a friend 's .
yes i have . i 'm interested in it .
what did you enjoy it ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it is . but the story of the city is not in town .
yes it was a very good job but not in the field and i am not sure if the same would be plastic .
before the time of shipment i was wondering if it could be received .
definitely . oh well i 'm afraid we 've been looking forward to seeing the fact . it 's our wedding anniversary and we 're going to start on the east of our new project .
do n't you know that they have a girlfriend ?
i 'm sure it 's a good game .
yes . it 's true . some people have never met before .
it 's true . some people have never met a better feeling about it .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
yeah i 'm still .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
really ? what about you ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you know that this is the last time i 'm here .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too much or too little wo n't you ?
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think you 'll have a chance to try ?
that 's a good idea . you can look at other language websites and see how you can look .
i heard tom 's talent is the most popular . one of the difficulties in the game is to listen to .
sure . i like chinese tea very much . it 's fine for me .
many chinese women like chinese women . they re very popular .
you know on a date .
oh i see . thanks a lot .
that 's the packing line .
so he was also responsible for the law school . that must be very good . i 'm sure they can do whatever they want .
do you know that ?
certainly . the chinese restaurant is a little different from the old . but it 's not very practical .
who tried to type ?
a good idea . remember to also the official course .
no problem .
don t worry about it . that s probably of the stress you ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you i d just sleep read a book or watch tv . here is your prescription .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
well i heard that a lot about me .
so you 've been pretty woman for the month now ?
my friend and i was argued with each other .
yes i know . we chinese have to be able to learn from each other .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
that 's right . he 's in room to live with his parents .
i guess so .
do you have to use a pc ?
you have no idea . and i like to be independent . there is more for <unk> .
i have been thinking about this for a long time . i have been very busy recently . i think you should follow the university .
she said she would like to know how to face the meat .
all right . i 'm nearly ready . what time does the bus leave ?
well i do n't think we need a table for ourselves .
it 's a great campus .
are the advantages of buying online shopping ?
what makes you say that ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well people from asia to europe .
it 's an excellent birthday gift . i usually try it once . it makes me more fun .
that 's great . i think we should spend our time together to have a chat at the bar .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
oh i hear the birds singing and music . my dad is a great mother . i ca n't believe it !
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i m sure you re right .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
do you think they ll go there with them ?
we usually go to the bank . they have a good service and we can go up the earth .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
we can play together if you like .
hmm . . . okay i 'll take that one .
you know on a date .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should know that this place is so beautiful .
you said it . it was n't cold or warm .
what would you like to drink ?
not bad .
no they 're not . i 've decided to give them a chocolate cake .
do you have to go to the seafood restaurant ?
i think that there are only one person who can get together and special .
i m going to the hospital .
that 's a good idea . what 's the problem ?
i guess we 'll send you a next time .
me too . i 'm always into the <unk> as my friend .
i didn t think much of it .
are you watching it ?
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
do n't worry . i will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
we have n't decided yet . i 'm going to the city of the city .
you 've made a good decision . it 's very beautiful is n't it ?
if you ask her to let us know .
you have n't been to the states yet . do you have a garden ?
it 's very good .
well a little bit expensive but you can do it yourself .
what time will you be home ?
yes i have . i 'm going to the travel agent .
do you have to watch nba game ?
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
well . there are several excellent things you can use for an online play . first it 's a very simple washing machine . people use the internet too .
are they coming to chicago again ?
yes it 's a very popular game among young people .
i won 200 to spend on any books of those books !
wow . that sounds great .
she 's pretty conservative .
i would but i did n't mean to . . .
do n't you feel well today ?
i got the right bus . i guess i should be going .
it 's not all that hard to say . . i do n't mind being busy at all .
two doctor .
did you go to night clubs ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have to get a ticket for you .
i think it 's how much it goes .
did you ?
how come ?
would you be able to pick him out of a lineup ?
mike i had a great time . thanks again .
so do i .
the weather is good here . let 's go !
ok . i wo n't keep you then .
just get the basics . this is a white shirt .
she is the one who has really good taste .
so what is it ? oh man i thought he was too excited to do .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
sure what do you need ?
no thank you . i d like to get them now .
in a sense . they used to be the most interesting thing for the chinese contest .
actually i 'd like to know if you buy a textbook for your family .
that 's a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
wait ! i get the promotion . . . .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now .
he 's very cute .
yes he sure does . he 's here at the moment .
sure . so what about the olympic games ?
what about the olympic park ?
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now .
it 's a traditional chinese film .
no why ?
i should have lost my word for it .
things are all right . i ran into this machine . i know a few weeks ago .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
how long does it take to get there ?
lulu . say hello . oh yes . is it a parrot ?
he 's got a promotion .
does she wear lipstick ?
i know ! they are really running out of this world !
your car is in the parking lot .
oh i m afraid i can t . i ve got a lunch date already .
oh that s too bad . it s too expensive for me .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
it s a fun job .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i got it . i have got to work on the team this morning .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see if there is any way i can help you with that .
ok i can afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon afternoon .
i am glad that you like it .
about two weeks ago . i ve tried to use it since then . sometimes i m not sure if it s got something .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
yes . i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
that s really a lot of fun . you can have a look .
i thought it was a little .
thank you steven . i m so surprised .
that s a great idea . when is it ?
yes it 's me . but she 's dangerous .
i see . what did she tell you ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
next june .
yes it s still early . if we don t start on the safe side we ll be able to buy our new apartment at the airport .
no problem . i 'm not much of a dancer myself . .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well .
well you will meet your wife and let her know that there are a lot of business in this world .
let 's see . . . the doctor says that we have to be there by eleven thirty .
i 'm going to miss you .
i m going to talk to you about it next time .
do you have to stay there ?
the palace hotel .
i believe it will .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
perhaps we could make a clear discussion about the human resources that we need to solve the problem .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
you just need a vacation that is a family that gets on my mind and we just look at what we need to do !
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must be terribly disappointed .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
is she chubby ?
no i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two childrenone son and one daughteras well as one daughterinlaw and one soninlaw .
do they have any grandchildren ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
no she 's working in a public office that can take care of everything .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
he s a sad dog .
he 's a year older than me .
how s your father ?
he 's fine . he retired last week .
oh that 's nice . he is always busy with his family .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
that 's right . so what kind of people are looking for ?
do you want to go for a pet ?
i only have one small time .
are you kidding me ?
i am very glad to hear that .

i think you just need to get more sleep .

maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
oh i am glad you like it .
about two weeks ago .
i don t know . maybe they have a brother .
i have n't got it . it 's nothing serious . it 's probably just the flu . i 'll give you a prescription .
i am afraid it isn t .

i 'll wait for you at the station .

great . i 'll take it . thanks .
oh certainly .
where would you like to be in 5 years ?
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
oh did they ? well would you give us an extra key to the room ?
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
by the way what should i do with the key when i go out ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
what was the score ?
oh i did n't even think about that .
i really appreciate the help . how many years have you been with the company ?
how many children will you have ?
why do n't you go to see a doctor ?
right . can i get a hot water too ?
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i really hope it wo n't happen again .
i have a terrible headache .
may i take a message ?
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
maybe you should think about moving .
yes . the room is dead .
did you have a lot of time . but you should go to bed early .
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you can call the post office .
i do n't know . it was there a very big hotel .
let me see . . .
well you have to wait .
the bank closes in 30 minutes and i need to cash a check .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
hmm . . . i d really like to get to the train .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
where does the bus go ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the people said it 's the weather .
pretty good . i do n't know if i 'll get the ticket .
not too bad . it is said that there is something wrong with it . let 's go to a movie .
i am really sorry .
did you explain to me ?
oh that s a great goal .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
my grandmother just passed away .
do you have a fever ?
yes a low fever . i feel terrible . am i dying ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .

that 's fine . i can talk to them now .
oh yeah . that 's a system we can save more money .
oh that 's interesting . what do most people think we should do ?
we 've had a good time . we look forward to something more than we 've had . your idea is to have some great difficulty in thinking of your products .
how can we solve it ?
our products are of good quality . since the goods are not in good condition it 's not much of a strong quality .
i can t help me to look at apartments with their dress .
our company will have to choose a good one when they get the reply . i will call you as soon as the company meets .
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . .

well thank you for all your information . i do think they will be a very useful job .
yes . do you offer any opportunities for further study ?
how many places of interest do you have ?
how do you know about your health ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

i learned japanese beat the stock news .

i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i am quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .

i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you are right .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
then how about i go to read the book ?
i can explain the financial information and third of the position i have done .
you may consider something about the preparation . for the others like to be listening to and for a few questions .

yes . there is one more thing .
what am i doing ?
ok i can have my list of skills next time .
what should i do ?
right now i have a lot of experience in marketing . i can help you prepare for the research and interviewing .
i 've been fed up with study .
you 're lucky .
it is hard to find a parttime job to take .
yes i am responsible for the sales manager in this position . how are you ?
oh yes ! i remember now . but you 're working with others .

the thing is your card i will be happy to do them . a lot of questions are <unk> . what you think is the most important thing for your business in your account ?
yes ?
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what s that ? it s definitely a big question . . get away from me !
you know on a date .
well it s a very important thing to me . i don t think the problem will be printed in the future .
i don t understand .
it depends on the job . usually i am very busy at work .
yes there is . they are not urgent . i also want to look at some of the latest trends for their website .
no really ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't fall in love with her .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
did you know what he was trying to do ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you 'll have to wing it .
that 's right . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
martha gets jealous easily and sara was it was just a friend .
you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not too spicy for me . you can t walk around the corner .
well to be honest with my friends ! i got an overall statement from the university and i have to be an extra day !
if you were choosing a person for this position what would you prefer to do ?
i think the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his hand .
but she is always in a good mood to rest up the talk . she s always up the time to rest of the time .
wow they must have had great reputation .
oh my . why do you think you will be back to work for us ?
company will get married in a few weeks . how about the staff ?
wow ! this sounds like something she would really enjoy ! are there any people waiting for ?

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i studied at anshan university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've got a job with a computer engineer 's compensation for several years .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing
what s that ? i see from april 14 months ago .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled english education in high school and it was published in the education magazine .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
yes . i 'm usually studying in the foreign languages department .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
oh i see .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so why don t you tell me you re interested in this position ?
i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .

they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what kind of professional development do you like best ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was young at around 16 .
i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so what seems to be the problem ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?

mr . liu is available at 215 today . will that work for you ?
that s good for me .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

someone has stolen my cell phone .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .
is this all right ?
everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the 2nd round

good question . but i will tell you when you pass the first two .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it 's no problem .
i see . what can i do now ?
when you have some id i 'll check you can get you .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm . look at the pamphlet . she says it s an amazing growth record . they ve noticed the very good reputation . i think it s really easy to see if they can t break into the china .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
where do you want to go ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .

my check for 100 to 0 . 8 million dollars in cash .
i see . well the goods must be shipped from new york to the l c .

yes that s true . ok . i ll list them for you .
we 'd like to hear that .
the packing is very narrow . it 's complete that packing . the goods were extensively used in our shipments to high such packing and our clients are working days now than the years ago . the goods must be shipped before shipment . hong kong is out of the question .
ok can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ?
ok should i have brought them with me ?

well we only accept your offer .
do you have a common practice in your job ?
yes you are our office . the price has been founded for five years .
our third place is very competitive so we 'd like to discuss the details . but before you give us the details to know what you 've done .
i 'm easy to say i 'm always h . a .
how many shifts are there in your factory ?
i am sure it will be difficult to make a commission of the amount on every deal . so if we make a deal with you the commission we will consider it to be 3 .
how many seconds in an hour ?
oh my goodness . i 'm sorry . but i 've already been tai chi !
yes . when you hear it 'll be back at 8 o 'clock .

well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s all right . should we say that about the topic before we go ?
not in a million years !

i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
thank you for reminding me . i really appreciate it .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
i 'm sorry i have to go back again .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

well how long does it take to get a bachelor 's degree ?

our price will be impossible for us to start on the market . can you tell me how far we get there ?
yes . we ve had some very good articles in doing that . we ve had to cut it up with three weeks in one month .
i 'm sorry . we ca n't give you an immediate answer for this problem .
