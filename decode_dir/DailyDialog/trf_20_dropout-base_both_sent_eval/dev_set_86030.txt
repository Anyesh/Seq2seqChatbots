we can take a bus there .
does this bus go there ?
i think a cab is better .
how about going for a walk in the park ?
no it 's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let 's get on . oh no judy ! get off the bus quickly !
oh i 'm afraid we 'll have to wait for the next bus .
we got on the wrong bus .
b . how do you know ?
hi . who 's calling please ?
any time between 8 a . m . to 9 p . m .
it 's almost noon now .
yes what kind of room are you in ?
could you tell me when he comes back ?
yes please tell her i stopped by .
tom has gone to lunch .
you have to pay a small pass .
fine .
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i would like to but the traffic is too heavy .
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
by the way what about the price ?
you are in luck . the traffic is not heavy today .
how long will it take to get there ?
is it so cool ?
he is at the warehouse this morning .
you really want me to tell you that i 'm going to call your girlfriend .
at least she have n't done that .
i know a number of people .
this is a circuit board .
what a pity !
about one time .
yes . in a moment i was running a double room with a fever and a half hour .
no not here . we are the museum of the whole city .
oh no ! i forgot about it . i 'm so sorry .
do you know which one he would like ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
how much is it ?
i am not exaggerating at all . i am not sure i like the jacket though .
i 'm very glad to do that . i have a terrible headache and i 'm a bit of a hurry .
okay sir . i 'll have it for you .
it 's just too heavy for me . do you have any other seats ?
it does n't matter . no one will laugh at you .
no i do n't like the one .
oh yes . we are the most experienced people .
it is very kind of you . i 'm so moved by you .
no problem . come in please .
wait a minute . that 's the most important thing . we can go to a doctor and ask her for a few minutes .
my new car was so old ! everything was alright with me .
hurry up ! the smile is frozen on my face .
oh that 's all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .
i am sorry . it is the right one .
i must have been you catch a lot of time .
yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .
ok . we 'll see you on the same day .
can you tell me the exact place ?
can i just do it here ?
i 'm afraid you have to take the money .
so where do i go then ?
that 's nothing .
no . they are already <unk> .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
come on . if we save more money we can retire earlier and you ll actually have time to read all those books you buy .
no i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
have n't i asked you to call if you 're going to be home late ?
i have to send it to you about a week or so .
let 's see . from here you have to take the 278bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
you 're new at this huh ?
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
how much is the fare ?
it depends on how you want to travel .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
oh it 's my pleasure . after all you are very qualified for the position .
i 'd like to choose a new hairstyle . could you go downtown with me ?
does this watch have any size of that ?
yes i will need them to be finished by this week .
ok .
a taxi it is .
yeah and remember if you want to order something else just let me know .
do n't bother . i can get it done .
usually it 's two hundred dollars a month .
i 'm a lot of trouble with that .
i 'm afraid they are too busy .
size one . by the way what if i bring home this sweater and my wife doesn t like it ?
a taxi it is . where will you be headed ?
black please .
ok i 'll take it .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
the next thing is that i have a list of all the things you need to do .

how many prints would you like ?
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
i 'd like to choose a new hairstyle . could you go downtown with me ?
how about a lizard ? that 's the very thing i do n't like .

rise and shine sleepyhead .
and they 're small fry .
are you all right ?
yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
no i 'm not . i 'm going to the gym to be a lot of people .
let me see . it 's my first double room .
so the dishes are left and then go up . ok !
i was not born yesterday . it was n't always like rain .
maybe you should try to quit smoking . it 's hard for your health .
no i 'd rather have hot water and sometimes played football .
a dessert sounds nice .
could you tell me what ?
a 100 .
i 'm surprised . she 's a plain jane .
i 'm going to the hospital to see him .
that 's harsh .
are you kidding ?
how about you ?
how about there ? they 're so hungry .
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
everywhere ?
now i 've been wanting to see your eyes . and i 'll check it for you .
do n't worry about it . i 'll get you one .
that 's too bad . can i make an offer ?
i don t think so . i m pretty sure i can do it .
well i would like to offer you at least 10 yuan .
it depends on how much you order
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
we can see .
do you think the rain is coming up soon ?
i 'd like to try some other dishes .
i thought so .

i 'll look at the car over there .
yes i d like to look at the magazine .
oh yeah i have to go back to the supermarket .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
thanks . i will get it .
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .
i 'd like to choose a new hairstyle . could you go downtown with me ?
sorry . i have no problem .
oh these are exactly what i m looking for .
yes i 've been to britain many times .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
but they are single they fall in love with another woman .
but for example in china it 's okay to talk while eating . however you may regard it as rude .
yes the one is corner of the card .
it 's nice but it 's rather too heavy for me . can i try it on ?
well it s 100 rib for the sim card then it will cost you about 10 rib per minute to call the uk .
oh it 's too expensive . can you give me a better price ?
i could tell you . say i 'm still a little worried about the school .
you 're right . she is full of vein and <unk> .
oh i do n't know .
she gave me no idea what she 's done . i mean that she has n't been out of her life .
do n't worry about that . but we can go home and get there .
that 's right . i was thinking of taking a walk .
i 'm sorry you have to leave .
i don t have enough money so i want to invest my money .
well the best we can do is to protect ourselves from getting rid of the heat so we ll save the energy from getting rid of it .
are you available on the last night ?
how many years have i held your goods ?
so it s just when you are in college .
i like to try it now .
i can help you with that . but i 'm sure you can find a way to live if i have more money .
you said it .
ok . how are you these days ?
you 'd better tell him .
you have to pay ten cents for every copy .
let 's look at our menus .
could you do that ?
you 're in the garden jane . it was the best one i 've ever done . but please don t pay attention to the piano when they were in your own .

it 's a good idea to start with . what are you going to do ?
any special brand ?
ok . i 'll have a try .
thanks . i 'm sorry .
what 's the brand ?
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
i 've already got a hamburger and a pair of fish pie .

yes i think so . do you think that you can do well ?
the gym are different from summer vacation .
i 've made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
i m glad to hear that .

i know . you 're right . the past few months i 've been able to find a job that is a little more sensitive and optimistic than in the environment .
but mine has a car .
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
well i think you should give me some advice . you should have more details about your new apartment .

it was a long time . what time was the weather like there ?
just since today .
i walk every day .
do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ?
i 'll give you a ring next week .
but i get a big sale that is n't it ? i never understood in a red dress like this .
i 'm not sure if i understand . you 're a good student .

but you do n't need to work out do you ?
i have many children in america but now i have to take an hour to exercise so i only take an hour .

about three times a week if i can .
i 'd like to choose a new hairstyle . could you go downtown with me ?
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?
no thanks . i 'm good .
i want to give you a ticket .

i 'm absolutely sure i did n't do that .
well what do you think about this one ? you know i 'm not too worried about money .
how did you want to ride that ?
so i want to buy one .
it s only five dollars a day .
no . that wo n't be necessary .
it 's a deal .
that 's ok . say carl looks like you are in an understanding .
you 'd better wait ! i 'll call you if you can .
only 2 months of taxes would be shared by 5 .
i 'm sorry but my car is 36000 .
i know it is not an easy job . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .
how much are you asking ?
great ! i will apply for a position in your manufacturing process and then i think you must be aware that some other expenses are offering at the same time .
i want to buy a ticket for my daughter .
not really . i do n't have hot water and the tea are long .
it is extremely beautiful . this is the very thing i 've been dreaming of . please put in a gift box for me .

thirty dollars .

i 'm sorry but i would prefer the car .
i think you 're right . i 'll get him one .
yes . shall i get a ticket for you ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i feel sorry for you .
no but what time can i help you ?
ok .
hi .
oh i see . would you like me to reschedule you for another night ?
well if there 's nothing else i think we 've settled everything .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok thank you .
it ll cost you around .
will you be able to pay the rent on a top of that ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't ma 'am . we accept only traveler 's checks and credit cards .
can i have your keys please ?
no sir . the gym is just behind the door .
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
that 's exactly what i wanted .
ok we will choose it .
let me see . . . it s going to cost you 25 .
why do i need it for that much ?
ok . we offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . they have different interest rates .
i feel sorry for you .
no but what time can i help you ?
well you 'd better take an umbrella .
how long will it take if i walk ?
i think a cab is better .
number 13 buses leave from here and ten minutes .
do you take care of them everyday ?
sure . here you are . it 's a bit overweight .
i 'd like to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is rather oily and hunan dishes are very spicy having a strong taste .
i like the style .
i prefer the blue one .
well most of the time you like to read your favorite fashion magazine .
it 's too early for me . do you have anything to declare ?
well what do you think of the leading role ?
i like the back best .

excuse me but i do n't know what to do .
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
it 's a little tight .
i 'll buy one of those new perfume and a guest .
yes i think so . how much is the one ?
they re in fashion now but i don t think so .
how about an outlet ?

yes and what 's your name ?

my brother has gone up to me .
i understand . but why wo n't you check the logo ?
yeah i think we should have more roads built .
ok thanks for your advice .
excuse me ?
please send them to me by email box .
i 'd like to choose a new hairstyle . could you go downtown with me ?
yes . they are just next to the size of this one .
they 're ok but i do n't like the colour either .
i can help you with that .
no . i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash here .
i know it is . but what 's it like ?
they know where that might be ?
actually you should ask him for help . he 's got a discount .
well if you ask him i think you can ask the guy .
good idea .
mmmm . that 's not what i 'm afraid . and i do n't like the color . too much .
yeah . that s an interesting job ! i know even the reasons for buying computer games . . .
well you 're here a bit slow in the taxi . let me take you to dinner and have a look .

we usually eat chicken pork and beef . you eat these meat a lot in your country too do n't you ?
yes i 've done that .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
certainly i can i 'll buy some from butchers and cook for you next sunday .
sure . i 'll bring a bottle of wine then .
yeah . i 'm going to buy a new one and a new one .
if you 're ready we 'll do it again .

just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
just pick up the hell with you . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
what else are you going to do ?
is there a charge ?
yes . i am on a chinese table .
i am calling to cancel it .
it must be costly .
ok i ll take it . does it include the asking price ?
am i ready for what ?
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
let me have it .
i have never used an atm before .
are you still interested in living here ?
now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .
no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
that 's right . what 's the name of the watch ?
let me see . . .
i think that 's just too much for me . let me check . oh i 'm afraid we ca n't accept it .
we have that available .
yes . are you ?
i think healthy eating is a good idea to face one . what 's your secret ?
about three times a week if i can .
what do you do in your spare time ?
what are you going to do now ?
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure if it 's too much of a good time .
it 's easy .
you are a lucky man . how about your mother ?
do you think you can teach me ?

we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .

oh yes . it 's really a <unk> street .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . they do n't have much time in mind .
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes i might . after all i thought i would ask my parents for help .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
this one is ms . gray . it s an article that these article on the bottom floor . but they re not very particular about it .

i know that i am a quick learner and i do n't know what to eat .
what 's the english course ?
around seven .
that 's great .
how long do you expect your flight ?
oh yes i like collecting things . i 'm interested in different colors .
what if we watch a loud train should we call to see the factory ?
what 's that ?
that 's something that you really need to work on .
i 'll take it . well it 's time for you to change your mind .
of course i can teach you how to drive .
i think the most important thing is the end of the year .
i want to try on this pair .

yes on the contrary .
would you like to register now ?
i agree how much ?
actually the results are not so bad but also the tell me about the results of the year .

so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
stirred will be fine .
where is the fitting room ?
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
do you want to go to a motorcycle or a car ?
do you think you can get me there seven thirty ?
enjoy yourself .
i 'm glad to hear that . what are you studying ?
i do n't like ice cream with nuts in it .
i think that can be a lot of choices . what else do you have in mind ?
well then there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
i do n't think i can have a glass of tomato juice .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding me ?
no i do n't like them . they are not very delicious . besides i 'd like to have some chicken wings and ginger burger with hot water .
i would like to have the bean curd . my wife and my wife used to it for the french table .
i know . i 'm really addicted .
are you kidding ? what about you ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it is a good idea to eat brunch also in one day .
oh no . they are not allowed only in china . they 're also responsible for their products .
<unk> . what 's that ?
don t worry about it . i will help you .
have a nice holiday !
i 'm most grateful .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you think that there 's a lot of people here ?
what are you talking about ? did you get enough of them ?
they all have just come out of curiosity . i would n't be able to tailor them waiting until they come back .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
i think the better . it is more expensive than the ones .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i think you 're married .
i think you 're right . she is also a good friend and very considerate .
like what ?
do n't worry about that . you 'll need to fill out the form .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
can you find last month s report for me please ?
thank you . i hope to see you at school tomorrow .
and what about some soup ?
are you scared of anything ?
we are terribly sorry for that . we will check your order . would you like to have lunch together at the airport ?
how do you feel about relocating to another state ?
may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
do you want to put on a 15 day ?
are you still in america ?
don t worry . i m afraid we have to live in a more time .
some more chinese tea for us please .
what do you have to do ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that 's fine with me .
i think we should go to the bus stop . what 's the time ?
i m sorry to hear that .
i know but why do n't we get a hold of the car ?
yes on the contrary i want to make a reservation to be .

you can always wash cars and sell candy .
let 's do it .
give me one coke please .
that will be fine . she will come in and fill out the form and let you know when your daughter are free .
have you thought about going to a gym before ?
what does she look like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you have any questions about your work then you can get a promotion .
a little more than that . i wanted to eat but they re too busy .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes . my name is monica smith . i think it s broken .
is everything in the fridge leftovers ? i hate leftovers !
i have a check of your computer for 100 bounced .

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah that 's easy . how did you wear it ?
i got a job offer from dell .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .

yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fifty dollars at a bargain .
well you 're right . let 's go into the details of each other .
i know but i think it 's a little too <unk> .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yes you are right . just in case you will need to change it up .
no it 's very easy .
are we allowed to buy something ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
how long the course is ?
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well i 'm afraid we 'll have to pay for something else .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you can yourself a little more .
that 's the most important thing .

can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
it 's a actually over there .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
are n't they ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
i have to tell you the truth . it 's my responsibility to make sure that i have the right policy .
they 're only 25 dollars .
can you describe their taste ?
what about some soup ?
but it 's quite different . you know your city is not one of the most famous guys in europe .
where do they grow mangoes ?
i 'll take some too .
i do n't know . something rotten here ?

well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .

no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

well there are several kinds of carpets . one is to speak french and japanese .
well some of the guys are not very good at quality .
oh no i 'm afraid not . these things are just too old to guarantee anything .
do you have anything to declare ?
down to his shoulders . it 's beautiful like gold .
how long is it been on ?
the last one .
it 's a bit tight . but what are the date ?
ok . most popular or standard cars are well known to standard cars .
have you a bus tour ? i have one day left so i think the best way is to take a bus tour .
would you like to have a look ?
when can i get it ?
which one would you recommend ?
it 's nice and looks nice . but i like it .
yes but do n't you like it ?
yes what kind of smell do you like ?
there ! how does it look ? tell me if i 've got it straight .
sorry but i 'm not sure .
really ? i heard that tom might come to this store often .
we 've also got a fragrancefree one specially designed for sensitive skin . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
thirty dollars .
can you give me a special offer ?
certainly . we can look at the label . it s a very light and clear .
what is your date of birth ?
it is 12 years of christmas quality .

it depends on how much you want to buy .
good morning . i 'm interested in antiques . do you have any ?
you 've come to the right store . we have a good selection of necklaces for you to choose from .

i don t like the way that i wanted to try it on .

in that case i want your suit in dark blue shirt and on the black .

well it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
sure . we 'll take you to a red dress and a white one .
just a little .
certainly . the fitting room is on the corner .
well i guess you re right . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be responsible and that 'll cause you a lot of inconvenience too .
at 2 o 'clock tomorrow .

it s about fifteen minutes walk . that s all .
please tell me about it .
what are you going to do ?
yes may i have some more beer ?
oh sure . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes it 's the most exciting dinner i 've ever had .

i d like to have typical chinese food .

i ll have them ready by the end of next week .
yes i really want to go for a walk .
i like hot food too .
they 're fine .
i would like to have lunch .
across the courtyard on the right is the office . follow the signs to the correct line . is that clear ?
any place will be fine . you make the decision .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
do you know the city of the trains ?
<unk>
fine sir .
i have to drive an hour to the city .
i do n't think so .
it is . traffic is a bit too heavy for me .
nobody told you what happened ?
how can you tell me there ?
oh that s such a exciting dance ! what else can i do ?
i would n't mind a necklace . i was at the jewelry shop looking around and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces i want .
i 'm sorry but i 've never made up my mind .
we are now running late .
no but i 'm not really sure .
oh i see . yeah . i know .
oh that 's terrible . i think he was always better .
is it a large pan ?
something must be done .
did you have a car ?
how come ?
where are you going to find one ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
i couldn t agree more . that s why i applied for a job .
oh i see .
certainly . i will arrange you a new apartment for you .
i thought you had better make a high price .
do you have a medium in the house ?
no i don t think it s just that the designers have a copy of it . so i can look at what they have .
where to ?
please take me to this address .
all right . would you mind telling me the cost of the gas ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
ok how about 1230 pm ?
that 's fine . is there any extra charge ?
it 's my pleasure . is there anything else i can do for you ?
here 's twenty dollars .
only 308 per night .
oh i see .
thanks . we hope you have a good time .
yes and i have to return it to our company .
where are you heading sir ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
well it s a long way to go . i am sorry to get there are no traffic jam . it takes two hours every day you 'll feel very tired .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
where do you want to go to ?
here is ten dollars .
it 's a private garden .
you are suspected of smuggling . do you understand your rights ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
ok i will ask lucy to call you as soon as possible .
thank you very much . see you then .
oh hi angela it 's dan .
certainly . what kind of style do you have ?
thank you . now just dial 0 .
yes i am . i really don t find it .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure . let me just grab my coat .
ok . what about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
ok i will go get it now .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven .
hi jason . i was just calling to meet you at the airport tomorrow .
mike . did you call the customer ?
very good . are you coming for the interview as a secretary ?
i 've been working too .
how do you really think that ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . i am very happy to hear that .
i would like to make a call to see you because it 's not too late .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since yesterday .
i will think about it .
she 's handsome . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what does she think of ?
yeah i know it 's one but i am a little worried about the traffic .
that might be a good idea . how old are you ?
but that 's not the <unk> .
fine sir . we will arrange one for you .
i see . i 'll take the time .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you 're going to have to clean it up first .
when i put my keys on the lower floor i don t want to put it anymore .
wow ! you re a lifesaver !
what happens if that 's the price of these days ?
whoa ! you don t have to do that !
oh you know i fell in love with this place when i first came out i was really busy . first i could n't make out the grill . . .
ok boy i turn it off .
are you serious ? you have to stay in the lane i was running into your house .
i m looking for a sweater .
what about these ? these are the latest fashion now .
i d like to have a try . how long does it take ?
and ?
so you must be pretty interested in the photography then . i guess i might go back to the library before i go to see that i m sure you ll have been reading them .
no i do n't want to miss it .
thank you . do you have any other questions ?
and you have a good taste .
thank you for taking a walk . i m glad we ll get out of the city .
i don t like the computer . you can use it .
oh wait a second ! where 's your new house ?
i don t want to have it . why do you want to buy an old one ?
what 's it look like guy who is this ?
no . i 've been wearing a heavy jacket .
there s a big cavity .
thanks !
when i woke up there i had a bad hangover this morning .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
no . i m not .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
how does the party have ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have a great time ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had my first job with me this morning .
now we re in the wrong direction . we re going to have to clean up all the time .
ok . you are looking forward to your arrival .
i just ca n't stand it . it looks like the air conditioner . there are always some problems .
oh good come on . sounds today .
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
do you have a size 8 ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you should do some exercise .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that keeps you alert and <unk> .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
where are you going to find one ?
can we have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do about it ?
that s enough .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please go in bed ?
whatever . i was my best choice .
well in that case i am afraid i can t do it .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i did ! i also bought some clothes and i needed some photos of my friends from college .
no i think the food is good for people . i think its color is good .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
oh all right . do you have anything else ?
maybe a arm .
i think the fitting room is a bit more expensive . do you have a bigger one ?
maybe you have a point . you can get a discount on the high street .
i don t think you ll find a discount on the high street . don t you agree ?
well i ll take this one .
of course the changing rooms are over there . they can look at the pattern and listen to what you want .
we 'd like a few seats .
all right . anything else ?
i want a formal one .
i m sorry sir . what s this charge ?
yes sir your price is very affordable .
you are are there a job that is more than 5 most expensive .
well i am looking for a pair of shoes .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's a great idea . i can read the paper for you .
oh there is a supermarket nearby . it 's quite expensive . i think there are also some white house in the house .
good . i will see you then .
will you be checking any bags today ?
that 's ok . i think i know what to do . thanks for your help .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
do you want to bring me some id with me ?
we really need to think about these things .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am afraid the price has been reduced by 50 . it 's very expensive .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
that s great . i m going to get to the station in . thank you very much .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
how much are you looking to rent it ?
oh ok !
how could you tell me about it ?
why do you think that there are so many dishes left ?
is this a color tv or a black shirt ?
oh look they have a nice view of the window .
will there be any extra charge ?
it 's a little expensive . can you give me a discount ?
we have three .
that 's exactly what i was thinking of ! there is a lot of other people in this city . do you know of buying the house ?
ok i have it .
i must have been going to the library .

i thought you should pick up some <unk> .
ok . we will take it .
it s a special kind of sports .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello this is bob . i was calling to tell you that you had a problem with your new apartment .
it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i m afraid i can t do that .
i know a lot of people wouldn t agree with that .
yes . why ?
that 's good . have a good day .
no problem . wish you a lot .
are you planning on going to university ?
that 's fine . i 'll be back in a couple of days .
we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine .
i would like to transfer some money .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i need a visa .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
sounds reasonable .
can i have my 200 please ?
yes . i think it is a little too much for me to quit my present job .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just taking a break between this sir .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
that 's a lot of chinese people in america .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .

i 'm afraid i 'll be staying in a bit of a hurry .
the best i can do is to offer you a better position .
no not at all . the side of the tree is right there .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .

well do n't you know for sure ?
i have no idea where to find one .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
it is a no . 22 bus .
this place does n't look like altadena .

which direction should i take ?
there are a plenty of signs such as watch for children !
there are many famous spots there . it 's good for your health .
i 'd better take you there .
i like it but there is one problem .
i m glad to hear that .
i got laid off today .
that s all right . i ll be moving as soon as possible .
that s ok . thanks .
i don t know what you re going to do about it .
take the books out of the bookcase . put them in this box .
that s true .
it s going to be a problem .
oh . that s terrible .
that s good .
i like it but i m afraid it s still a bit too big .
do n't be a problem . i 'll also have a look at the problem .
i have a check of your computer for 100 bounced .
if that s the case then i will fix the faucet .
i heard that you moved to florida .
you are in good shape .
the usual you know something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent .
that s true .
thanks . see you .
that s pretty high .
you re having me on again .
ca n't you make an offer on a menu ?
we did but that s why i have to call the apartment .
well then let me hold on for a moment .
i do n't think the leak was in the bathroom .
maybe that 's true . but where are we going to start ?
i 'm going to try a bedroom set .
that 's cool my wife . i 'll look forward to it . do you have a savings account with you ?
you do need to send it via email or registered mail ?
i think that will be fine !
i 'm afraid you need to take the no . 14 tram .
do n't you know for sure ?
i want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language .
i think you have done a very good job .
if you do n't mind we 'll find a taxi stand on the street .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
we should take a bus .
ok . where do you want to go ?
under the sign for the gas station there will be a smaller sign that says selfserve or fullservice . and some gas stations have both . but if they have both some pumps will be selfserve and some will be <unk> . you have to look at the signs .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my wife 's fault is n't she ? well the first time i was worried about her . .
we have to wait for the next bus .
i 'm pretty good .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
you are welcome . please take a seat . i 'll be waiting for you .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
good . i 'll come back in the evening .
no i usually just drive .
you have your own vehicle ?
i have it but i want to take a long time .
what s on ?
it 's a good idea to run a red light but it is n't very convenient .
this is better for your trust .
we will go to the city centre and get off at the zoo station .
what do you think we should hire a car or a band ?
sounds interesting .
how long are you going to stay there ?
i do n't know . we 'll miss the statue of liberty .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
i got it but i did n't .
i think you 're right .
i 'm still not feeling too well . i think i 'm getting a promotion .
i am going to miss you too .
i 'm sorry to have taken a taxi .
hi mary .
i 'm just shopping .
really ? congratulations !
yes but i 'm not sure if i 'm going to .
yes i felt dizzy when i stare at you .
i m afraid not . but i ve decided to give up a more than 10000 units .
you like the food there ?
that depends on how busy the lines are .
well i think you are looking for a more promotion .
i do n't care .
can you do it this afternoon ? i 'd like to have a look at it .
thanks for everything .
i 've been feeling pretty ill for a few days .
are you available today ?
sounds good . where shall we meet ?
that 's sad . it 's only one of those games .
it 's only a couple of dollars .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but she speaks very clearly .
this guy tried to rob the bank .
that 's exactly what i need .
oh great i will .
my favorite job is on the internet and i think they will be a good opportunity for advancement .
from that time we get back to celebrate .
from that . how about coming back ?
here is a gift for you . i hope you like it .
i 've been working a lot lately .
yes we have made a mistake .
i got a job offer from dell .
you see !
i 'm watching a movie and having a on tv .
i agree with you . but he has done many times .
i think i want to try a new style .
so what happened ?
i have been studying every day .
i know what you mean . i thought you were talking to me at a concert .
no i have n't . i 'd like to travel to several places .
can i have my 200 please ?
in the end of this month .
i like the fact that i am a fast learner and i like studying literature very much .
what other kind of food do you like ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?

good morning . you are mr . sun are n't you ? take a seat please .
if i 'm going to my new job i will listen to your advice .
you look great .
thank you . we 're going to investigate our services .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well the company has some financial problems . people there are all thinking of quitting .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it does . this one has a large selection of electric fan ere .
can i just do it here ?
well i think he 's just a little bit conservative .
well it 's certainly a big pan . how do you like the same one ?
i do n't know . maybe they are really crazy .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
a little more than that . i wanted to eat but they re too busy .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . let 's go over something together !
good . let 's go now .
how are you doing ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like going out .
that 's alright . but you really should have another drink . people will probably start dancing soon .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i do n't know .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . we 'll send a taxi to pick you up .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh no ! we 're late . the clock 's at six thirty .
it was a few things . the first thing that happened was that i could n't fall asleep .
do you think that she 'll do well ?
i 'll try my best .
i am looking for a sweater .
i know sir . this way i 'll just take a look .
my check for 100 bounced .
did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?
i m all set .
we 'll take this steak dinner .
i think you 've got a really good memory .
how about a coffee shop next to it ?
<unk> a little . by the way what kind of food do you like ?
we could share the same table .
i do n't want it . you know i 've had the steak and the lobster before . they are both very tasty .
that 's 7 dollars and 25 cents .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
that 's my pleasure . good luck !
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
maybe you can buy it now .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
there ! how does it look ? tell me if i 've got it straight .
that 's ok .
sorry . you have to take the shuttle to go in .
yes that 's the right size but it 's too heavy for me .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
have you heard a new one ?
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have found a new apartment on the market .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i do n't think you can finish the report by saying so .
you are always like this . i don t think you re going to be sad in the wrong way .
thank you for your concern .
do n't worry about that . i 'll get you an appointment in a couple of days .
when do you find it ?
yeah i 'll do it for you . if you do n't mind do you can use it for me ?
did you just a phone ?
well i ll put them on the marketing budget . i need to get back to you first . what big is the new for the new year ?
but you should know the price of the order .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
i 've been spending a lot of time watching tv . i just got back in the morning .
that s great . we ve always enjoyed working with you . . . you know i m going to have to take a break !
i 'll try later . what are you doing over there ?
i love you .
can you describe your behavior ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi i have a seat . do you take me to the hospital ?
great ! it s almost noon . i am running out there with her .
will it take me straight there ?
do you have a car ?
oh don t worry . i ll be fine .
what about going to the car ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
well it 's not too big a pan but it 's too heavy for me . do you have any suggestions ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! this is the first time i 've ever tried to watch it .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m not sure that it is hot too .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
okay . whatever you say . i ll give you a call !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
well if you get a hold of me 'll get it .
i am so sorry about this .
you look a big fan of fresh air . i think that s really cool !
anyway i think i need a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m your best man . this is my best friend . you know i 'm going to cut out a bit off !
have you ever thought about this before ? i am just kidding .
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
and not expensive either .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's the one with a red shirt .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to bill 's house .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
it 's not the only time to get .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and and and and and and and people . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i really do n't think you have done that .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . i 've decided that i 'm on a business trip to spain .
ok . i 'll give you a ticket next time .
oh come on ! i love this job so i 'm going to take a bus trip with my wife and a baby .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
what time do you want to take the train ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .

i 've got it down .
oh that 's my opinion . they 're the only two of the best guys in the kitchen .
you 're pulling my leg ! she 's a fool .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he has a girlfriend last week .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they were very nice .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
i think so . he s just got married yesterday .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
many people are attracted to tastes .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what are you going to have ?
yes i just ate a little and i did n't make it .
<unk> . dinner 's on me .
on the level ?
no it 's too far . i 'm afraid i ca n't afford to go .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i wish i were going to rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really want to play football ?
i am .

thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm most grateful .
have you got the time ?
and not expensive either .
should we walk ?
yes it is . may i help you ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you want to go to the beach there ?
these books over here are over there . can you give them a few advice ?
yes we do . i went to a party this summer . it was very exciting .
i ca n't miss it .
i have a house on the 17th street .
let 's take a look . oh ! she looks like her husband 's mother .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well you can count on me .
no joke !
i don t think they are right . they re horrible .
but it 's easier for us to watch and tv .
the one that says no . 4 are on sale .
i do n't know . they are the ones that i guess .
i think i will try .
it 's easier said than done . when you start worrying about it can you ?
no . please do n't tell me you 've got a dead stack . i hate making cold calls . .
no i have n't . i 'm a bit of a hurry .
i 'm a real man in a bad cold .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
it 's if you are not interested you are going to get more and more physical exercise .
are they ?
what 's interesting to see there ?
this is a small thing you have to do .
i know . today we are offering a new ties . i 'm sorry .
you should n't have stayed up so late watching tv . i told you we had to get an early start .
but we have n't even started our relationship yet .
i will .
no . i took a taxi .
as i know the saying goes well the secret is to your beautiful country . just keep trying and more professional . the more and you know the better than the <unk> .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh no . that 's not a bad idea . what about the pollution part ?
and not expensive either .
that s good ! but we ll be getting back to work later .
i 'm still not feeling too well . i think i 'm getting a promotion .
if you can keep the group there i would n't be any silly .
sure we will .
ok i 'll go by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
we do n't live in the fourth floor .
wow ! that 's just one of the best things we 've ever had .
yes i 'm just so handsome .
no problem . i feel quite tired right now .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it was very different from chinese education .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he 's history !
i 'm sure you know that it 's . so what 's it going to do ?
oh i see . we can watch a movie on the first floor .
did you see the pictures of the movie ?
of course ! i 'm finished now .
how many chapters does the book have ?
it 's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about it ?
i agree . he used to be too relaxed to be in such a great country .
he still has a really good working experience .
maybe . i 'm glad to help .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we 're working on our own tonight .
sure . i 'd love to try it . it 's on the high street and be sure to be taken .
thanks for inviting me . i 'd love to .
ok . i 'll wait . but we have to get going to the car first .
but she 's so pretty .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
i 'm sorry that i was absent yesterday .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's go to starbucks and think of something ?
star war .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
to tell you the truth i do n't really like it .
oh i have n't thought of that . she s a big girl .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
who s the head of your family ?
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
go to the movies .
that 's good . so you must be very familiar with english too .
we want to make a deposit of the agreement .
three times a day is that the end of the world .
i feel they 're not rich . it 's bad .
what if the goods do n't print on the computer ?
i do n't think that the tip of the gas . we also have to pay the bills of the damage .
i m crazy about him .
really ? i want to go too .
four . they 're all handmade .
oh i see . i love the sight .
i couldn t even help it .
it was a great game .
i know ! but i could not do it .
yeah . we all know that the people who have been planted in the north of the rain .
how could it be ?
no as long as you are not allowed to cover the gas .
what ? no way .
ok . i 'll take care of it .
that 's true .
i 'm not sure but she 's still pretty conservative .
you are right . what about the football team ?
you know i don t really believe that ! ok so we are all learning how to eat .
i know . it is not the only way to eat foods but life is not enough .
you should have heard about that .
i mean that . she 's a psycho .
what a pity !
she 's kind of plain .
all right i 'll adjust the price of the new products .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
tell me about it .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i know .
hi !
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what do you like about bill ?
ping . ping .
what do you like about it ?
i 'm at the post office .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't realize that .
how long have you been married ?
the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not much just a house party for tonight .
do n't take any chances . it 'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again .
oh that 's really tough .
yes . he was supposed to be able to evacuate in time .
good boy . i must tell you what happened .
it 's a good idea .
it must be just some convenient . you wo n't have the guts to call the police .
great . do you want to call you later ?
neither . the game ended in two all .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films but i do n't think he 's so particular .
oh that 's not a problem . you are in love with what you want to do .
why do you want to talk to him ? it 's very nice of you to say .
so you 're under arrest for your new job and now you have a lot of work on it .
yeah . but his wife has been living with a long time .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
oh how about your history teacher ?
what makes you say that ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are looking for a job as a manager .
i 'm here on holiday and i do n't have a chance to get hold of all of you .
that 's great idea . i 'd love to . but i 'm not sure how to do it .
the seafood is great . i 'm sure the wine will be fine .
it 's about 5 kilometers .
you 're right . we 'll walk along to the city .
good luck !
thank you for inviting me . we will .
i want to go back to school .
why do you look unhappy ?
no have a seat .
i did n't want to . but i heard him him today .
i understand . but i 'm sure you have the right to work with a client .
yes but it was the most emergency room was n't so good that it was n't too bad .
but we still think that they are shy when they are more .
hello steven .

i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . i am very happy to hear that .
i would like to make a call to see you because it 's not too late .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since yesterday .
i will think about it .
she 's handsome . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what does she think of ?
yeah i know it 's one but i am a little worried about the traffic .
that might be a good idea . how old are you ?

this is kevin . i was calling to change my luggage and i was caught in a traffic jam .

they 're on sale today .
i know they 're a little more sensitive than 200 .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i think so . when i told you i 'd come to see it 's pretty .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .

i think so . and it 's very convenient .
that 's very convenient .
ok . . . . you should do some practice .
i met him through a computer that time .
could i come out ?
i have no idea . she looks quite depressed recently .
i had a few years of the college . i think that they were supposed to be a vegetarian .
have you been to california ?
i do n't know .
i had a few coffees while i was in the shower . i think that they had a good time .

that sounds interesting . what does your friend do ?
it 's interesting and it 's expensive too .
what 's the difference between the two ?
no most of the students are concerned about the tax .
well it 's not just that . i think we are all thinking of it .
oh that is a fair price .
it 's a better idea . i 'll get a .
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press conferrence and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
great . i 'll see you on the 7th .
there 's a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
oh i see . reading says i m not sure whether i can go to read one .
it 's a very cool one .

the party starts at 8 .
fine we ll have to go .
i just do n't think i can .
i am not sure yet .
okay . i 'll give you a call .
can you tell me how to get there ?
are you going to give me a ticket today ?
oh yes . your wife 's eye shadow is a teacher .
thank you for saying so .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
so our company will have to pay a dime a month .
sure . it 's to raise money for the homeless .
great . i 'll take care of it .
i never thought that . what do you think of it ?
do you know there are several catagories of chinese food ?
oh i have no idea .
no way ! they are dangerous !
i see . do you have all of these people actually ?
i hear it . people often seem to enjoy cooking but it 's a traditional chinese traditional chinese food .
i believe you will . remember to buy yourself a new one and if you come back with me tonight .
fine . i think i 'll be expecting you .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . .
can we bring anything ?
what can i do about it ?
it 's a program <unk> about islam . it 's very interesting .
i 've no idea . it 's my turn .
we could adjust the price of the product .
what 's the computers like ?
yeah it is ! we have been here for months ! i 'm just gonna quit my life !
so what is it ?
you can use the computer or other machines .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
sounds like fun . when can i start ?
how about afternoon ?
she 's very nice . would you like to come and celebrate our wedding ?
you 'd better tell your story what happened and how much to set up for .
i 'm sure i 'll be there .
so the difference is still a little high for one .
20 dollars .
what 's the rate ?
i m afraid we do n't .
i do n't have any cash with me but i think i 'll be happy to help you .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's a pity .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so the snow and beautiful in here are so beautiful . and where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've never had a chance to do a lot of good before . give me a break !
do you have any experience in this field ?
thanks . i think you have the right attitude .
it was the best game ever .
that sounds like a good idea . but what kind of film are you going to do ?
could you tell me what time it is ?
i do n't know . maybe they are really crazy .
thanks i think you re right .
i 'm still a little of both .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
and not expensive either .
it is such a nice place .
it 's my pleasure . what would you like to drink milk tea coffee orange juice or iced water ?
ok !
it 's a nice dinner .
actually you have n't have much .
no enough .
well i 'm afraid it 's not the bad . what does the flight say ?
jack i do n't want to see you anymore .
i think this is going to be a great opportunity for athletes to get to know physical conditions and they can make their own decisions .
oh no . i 'm afraid i did n't attend the press conference due to the conference . what time does the flight say ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have a fight with jack ?
yeah i went shopping .
did you have a good journey ?
i got a job and i 'll get my license .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
it was a pleasure .
it 's been a long time since we are together .
do you know what kind of food that you wanted ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation .
no please feel free .
oh is n't your computer wifi capable ?
yes i 'm found a little bit of a child .
miss li i 'm in love at the moment . please take a seat .
i love to dance the fast music .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm not at all keen on these games . and i think i like the waltz very much .
no i do n't think so . i 'm in a hurry and i ca n't stand it .
oh a disco ?
hey ! what about you ? how about your teacher ?
sounds interesting .
not really . i think the ancient olympics events is just about how many medals they are on tv .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that 's true . they are very uncomfortable and challenging .
i think the olympics team won the world .
and we can see some <unk> and food .
a very good idea .
yes in this position i was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . with the different initiatives that we implemented we lowered our <unk> rate to about five percent which had a direct impact on revenue .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good idea . there is a good concert of the country . it 's a beautiful country .
what 's your favorite program ?
thanks . who do you think about going to cook ?
i know you do n't go to dance . so i 'm not a big dance .
yes i do . i 'd love to .
you have a lot of fun .
we 'd better ask dad first .
dance class is my favorite .
it 's ok .
let me show you how . you are carrying so many books .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
of course . it 's lucky that i have a lot of fun . what about you ?
the only thing i will need to see is your driver s license as i will be notarizing these papers .
did you get caught in the bad storm ?
i didn t get accepted .
sure . hey look at those two ugly old ladies .
yes . go straight ahead .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old and he lifts weights every day .
good idea . so you must be a good teacher .
what do you want to play ?
oh you dance a lot . you know i 'm not good at playing .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what do you like best ?
i love to dance the fast music .
well then we must go to the dance floor .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
then what do you think about the clubs ?
yes there is a department store in wang fu jing .
oh i see . . . well what do you think i 'm looking for a guide ?
yes of course ! this is a really good one i 've heard it 's great for you to try .
what is your favorite in the world ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
where s the tea ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
may i ask you for a dance ?
thank you for your picnic too . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
is it very likely in england ?
yes that is why i remain here . i do n't want to get a big shot in the rain .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i think you can days from anywhere .
it 's quite hot and the temperature is often 37 and 40 .
how about tomorrow ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love hiking and cycling . it 's a good idea to protect myself .
is it hot in summer ?
i see .
it must be cold in the winter though .
no i 'm from guangzhou . i 'm here to see some big cities .
you look so young .
you know . i have told you .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no problem . go ahead .
if i have time i will come again .
i enjoyed the party .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
yes what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
i have no idea .
thank you . what 's the fare ?
all right see you .
yes . why ?
this is the worst thing .
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
oh what kind of sports do you like ?
i was robbed this morning .
yes we have tickets at 100 and 50 yuan .
my wife and i 'll be ready at the moment .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
my son was born and i 'm not going to leave as much as my father and i .
i do n't think this is fresh .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
that 's fine . where did you go ?
no it 's my fault .
my car is still broken .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well whatever . i do n't think it s better for a new employee .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he know that they had forgotten ?
you do n't think he is wrong .
is he getting better now ?
yes he 's afraid not . he 's in jail for housebreaking at the moment .
we have prepared a meeting with your wife and i hope you will have a good trip .
we 've had a great time .
no i 'll see . it 's a pleasure .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that 's a foreign man !
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
i think you had a very good relationship with him .
it 's freezing .
well . . . i guess i ll take a break and leave it over . how about a drink tonight ?
then i 'll clean it up .
i 'd love to .
well . . . here 's a gift for you .
tomorrow morning ? no i 'm afraid i 'm not free . i 've already made a reservation .
that 's all right .
we are looking forward to your mrs . wayne .
that s the one . i m sure they re the groom s niece and nephew . oh they are all a bit better .
who are the members of your family ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
yes it is . i have been here for too long .
oh i see . what did you do ?
as a matter of fact i have to go now . thank you for coming in .
you are my best friend . goodbye .
would you please fill out the form ?
do n't mention it . see you .
not bad . a surprise is that she should have been excuse to a date with her .
i m not the person who needs to do that . i don t know what to do with people .
i do n't think so . she s just one of the best ones .
that 's true . but probably it 's her mother is a little older .
it s a deal .
i 'd like to try to that .
of course . that 's fine .
but he 's not always on a regular weekend .
you should attend a meeting in the interview with the manager . it is very important to make sure that you are tired .
i think you can save a lot of money .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . it was a very exciting game .
dear go to bed and turn it in the back .
yes why not ?
of course . what did you say about ?
oh they are all right . they must be opening the boat .
no they are . they are peppermint chocolates .
i love my fashion designer . it was very interesting but i think i could have been very good at it .
i 'm afraid that it 's a new product .
quite interesting .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
would you be interested in a little more helpful ?
i know . but it 's worth trying .
if i catch up with my eyes i 'll go to the doctor and have a rest in the evening . i 'm sure you can get used to the fresh air every day .
how many hours of your time do you have ?
do you know how to set the timer ?
what else ?
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
when do you want to start the payment then ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
i highly recommend you quit soon .

i would .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .

but she 's really using heart to control what they 're doing .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
i think he 's broken .
do n't worry . you 'll be fine .
i think that s a good idea . it s a good idea to watch a movie .

i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid it is not necessary for me to face the music .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so what about you ?
no way .
what 's it about ?
thanks . could you tell me what 's your secret ?
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he was an excellent chinese teacher . but he had promised him that she would take a chance to practice speaking .
he said he had a mask on his face .
haha . actually it is a time to be one of your friends . we have a lot of congratulations on this .

yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .

sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .

i guess so .
yes we bought veal sandwiches .

i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please fill out the form ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
your present job is something better .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's a good choice . but can you come back for a little while ?
yes . no .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going out to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i am going to need a deposit .
should we walk ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
good idea . i 'm eager to go with my family .
it was a new car .
you bought a car . it s not like a barbecue .
no mary . may i take a message ?
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
hi alice . how are you ?
great thanks . and you ?
i m very sorry to hear that . i ll be right back .
how about 10 am ?
good evening . how are you doing ?
good evening . could you let us have a seat in the lounge ?
you have n't seen her for a long time .
i m going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests .
a minute please . oh yes . your daughter s very good . may i have your name please ?
a party of mine .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to . see you then . bye .
she can t be here until later .
yes . it 's a good job . and what about you ?
don t be sorry . i m always in the mood for it .
i got laid off today .
that s great .
yes i 've been thinking about that for a while .
the best part is the kitchen .
i think that 's a good idea . do you want to go into a more bath ?
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
i think you are just a good employee . you should do everything you can to write down your confidence and be yourself pretty soon .
do n't believe in all that healthy people 's social swimming and various markets ?
it 's just a little bit difficult to get used to the manager 's speed and then you 'll think about it .
i understand . i 'd like to pay my bills please .
that 's right . thanks .
we have a lot of money in this country . could you give me a discount for the kids ?
it is true . but you must take this job and make up your mind .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . do you have a move in ?
yes i 've only seen one in my life . i was thinking about it but my parents and i 'm taking it back to my apartment .
i have to but i have to work on the the internet .
hey that 's where i was . . .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was born in the city centre but i guess i just have to go back home at home and pay more attention to the school .
oh that 's why i did n't just go out at home with my parents . they always feel very sad about me .
i see . a lot of people in your apartment and said the same thing about how they are on the other side of the living . i mean it 's a good thing for you to live on .
i see . i 'm from taiwan .
i guess that s a big family . how many children are there ?
i 've asked my parents to live with me . they want me to have a look at me .
yeah i know . it is hard to tell people like them . do n't they ever cook by ourselves ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we share the same cooking as a guest .
sounds good !
i have to write a check of the person who took care of the life insurance and the police wo n't come in .
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your consideration .
my brother and his sister is a businessman . i know more about him .
well when you tell me about it i was a way of spending the weekend with my family .
are you able to move my weight ?
is he just broke up with him ?
yeah . he s still got a <unk> his wife s head .
it s a sad thing . we just started a little while . . .
yes . they are a lucky man .
i know what my parents sometimes have to bring about is . i think we just have to make a big fan of tv programs .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i mean we could have a look at this other tshirt . i think it s going to be a good shot .
it s quite reasonable .
well i 've only given one or two times a year .
when are you coming to los angeles ?
that sounds like a good plan .
what s your present permanent address ?
i asked her to beef up my clothes .
i guess i should go to her .
you should always have a choice of everything .
i did n't know . it was their first time . we could learn about it and see how to go .
i m sorry . i thought you were a very good employee .
oh i ve been out of town . i just got back .
how long did you stay there ?
no i went to visit my uncle . he lives in the united states and then i went to camp .
when to leave ?
yes . and i look forward to it .
let 's see . . . i think we 'd like to see the menu . have you made any ?
oh . that s quite a long time . how long have you been married ?
i often use the computer .
i can t wait to watch the football game . i think i m getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i can go with you .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i ca n't stand it well . and i like studying literature very much .
do you have a dog ?
i go to the gym a lot . i just go to the summer palace .
that is interesting . do you ever go on a day of the afternoon ?
i feel that way too .
that s true . i ll give you a call next time .
what store are you going to take ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
do you need a furnished house ?
well where can we go to get both ?
the only thing i want to do is to save the money i hope .
are you going to introduce me ?
no i was just joking . it 's my first time to get in .
ok .
right .
it 's the common practice to learn english .
i prefer tv play to football .
i feel that you are a little dehydrated .
well who is your favorite football player ?
who is your favorite author ?
i prefer chinese ones . but i like more than no more than half . i prefer chinese touch with children .
not really . what about you ?
is n't there anything else ?
i do n't know . i just thought we were able to learn something new .
and i m not going to have any type of allergies that i know .
yes of course . oh the girl 's birthday cake was 8 years ago .
oh ! yeah ! how silly of me to forget that .
that 's a good idea . but i feel afraid i can t do anything .
can i help you with that ?
i know . but i feel like watching movies really differently .
i do n't know . but i want to know more about it .
i do n't know . you can learn more from your english .
well there are several possible sources you can do . it s very good for you to keep fit .
i love to play on the swing as well . how long does it take ?
you 're very proud of your achievement .
yeah i think she 's broken .
goodbye !
i have a meet him this morning .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i 'm pretty sure .
just do n't say anything .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
or they 'll give you a special price . after all you have to do is to give me a special chance .
ok . i think you 'll be happy when it comes . a man of people here .
i know . but you were in love with her . and you know we love her .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
elvin ? why ?
just fine . are you busy now ?
yep . it 's a health insurance company and they 're prescription small and they 're small .
how 'd you know that ?
and he was so upset when i asked her to give me a chance to get this promotion .
i don t know .
how is it you don t know ?
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s a lovely neighborhood .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
the radio said that it 's a little higher than the temperature of the city .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
where 's your parents ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
what are you doing ?
yes he had two years of him . he was on a <unk> with his wife and two years ago .
i know . i think he was n't too serious .
that 's true . and he is a very good young man .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i know that . but it 's not my fault . there are always the truth .
well i can t wait to collect it .
did you hear about the new product line ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song is so funny .
this is our new excellent fact . come on a second and see him again .
oh she is my cousin . i 'm just flying back from home .
i do n't have any other options for example . . .
well there s always a long story . some people look different from the departments but she s not very strong .
oh she s a little different . our regular time goes well with the family . i 'm not sure we 'll get on our own staff when we get married .
yeah i 've never been to that type of music . i 'm not going to give her flowers or to be good at all .
i agree . do you have a good taste in chinese ?
you do n't have to ask her out for help .
i do n't know .
what s so interesting about turning on the internet ?
i 'm falling in love .
really ? how did it go ?
i had a bad day for a long time . they were supposed to live on a website with a group of people .
it 's worth going to .
yes . but he 's not in a bad mood .
that 's amazing . when did he start in the pond ?
yes i wo n't . he 's never said anything .
oh yeah . thought i met him before i met him in scotland .
is that right ?
i appreciate it .
that 's my grandfather .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
well my family lives in the city and he wants to go to the great wall .
is n't there a big slide ?
it 's 530 by my watch .
do n't worry . i will make you another bear .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
oh really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
do you often exercise ?
that 's fantastic . let 's go to the skating rink on thursday .
i know . but it 's just that they are not as dry as well . are they ok ?
yes i have a career path .
good idea . i think we can leave a few cities outside .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh your precious game .
i do n't . you know the head chef is going to a great hit !
i do n't know .
let me know .
the pink ones are beautiful .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's about two of us . this is the first date we 're here .
do n't worry . i 'll help you with it . please tell me the reason of the kitchen .
and not expensive either .
it 's only seven minutes into the game .
keep your fingers crossed . she 'll bring the bacon .
ok ok ok . let 's go .
it 's just a smoke . do you see the old textbooks for money ?
what 's the fare ?
you 're welcome . good luck bye .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
oh how do you do ?
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're lucky . what 's your favorite kind of sport ?
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you but i 'm a little worried about my work .
i think we 's just a natural issue .
what about these sites ?
yeah she is very quiet and has many restaurants under her tree .
it 's always better to make sure to get rid of them .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'm sure that . good luck !
that 's amazing ! but are you serious ? how soon can i see my mom is ?
that 's great . i 'll just give you a call later .
i see . i 'm glad that they 're saying so .
i 'd like to live in that store but it 's not very hot right now .
was it built before the in dynasty ?
it did n't arrive in time .
i can see that .
you 're just a little bit rundown .
he was n't messing up in school .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no this is the second time . but i also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
could you bring us back to the kitchen ?
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
did you get any of those ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
yes . it s a birthday party . we drank all kinds of thingsbeer wine and spirits . after midnight we were even drinking cocktails !
it s great ! that s the point of an amazing growth record .
he 's the one who saved the life of my life !
what about the sports set ?
maybe . but i prefer pop music .
ok . i 'll take them .
ok . i ll pick you up at .
of course ! it 's difficult to bring us a bottle of wine with both . but i 'm sorry i do n't know what i mean .
you can have a lot of free rugby in my country .
what about the sports page ?
no they must be terribly clean .
well it s all over the world . now it s about time to watch what the ball is like .
both of my family are keen on it .
that 's not the only problem . they are really tough .
you have to pay a membership fee every month .
do you know what the temperature is ?
no there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
what sports do they play there ?
i know . but it really hurts .
could you describe it ?
oh no ! what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
i do n't have a decent first aid kit do i ?
that s quite the way to get them .
oh . i 'm glad to meet you . but we do n't get any thing that is n't half the dinner .
well i ve been so busy ! i ve been bar to eat the dog down the baker s . i ve been to bar for a while .
no . but you 'd better not be surprised .
thank you ! we should get rid of it .
no . i left a voice message on onejust for the first person on the left .
i think it s a way to make the government .
<unk> for a change . but what do you think we can see from the low dance ?
even though the traffic is <unk> out there are more stop than 200 kilometers .
i agree . but i would probably use it . it 's probably just so convenient .
i 'll use my camera .
that 's true . but i think the government should do something about it .
well there s no reason to worry about . i m sure you will have to work overtime if you lose your money and they ll only have to .
i see . all the animals and food are made of leathers .
that s right . i think it s much more convenient than the others .
i 'm not sure i did .
i know . but it 's just a different thing .
well i think you should be more careful next time .
my dad is on a business trip . i 'll keep it .
so ? the doctor had been against him .
what s he like ?
oh no ! he 's a bit tall .
maybe he s just got a touch of his license .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
jogging and bowling . do you love waltz ?
did you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
i think my brother is very strict .
it s not only about going to be far away from home . you re lucky that s only going west of your family !
i prefer the running games .
that 's terrible . why would you keep up ?
that 's a part of it . all my friends play it the time .
there are a game on tonight . it 's good to watch people play .
not really . i go to play with my friends .
what position do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course it s an american film .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . what made you excited ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve been reading all his films on dvd .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all right . i ll have to read the first two or three glasses of books .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it better now ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't agree more .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is there a big line ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
can i do that ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've been wearing a new job . i need to have a doctor 's degree in english .
what do you mean by us .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
i m just going to have to write you a ticket .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not like this .
by the way my name is liu wei .
sorry . it 's tails .
oh it 's a beautiful neighborhood . let 's go with him .
all right . you are all set . you 're all set .
oh hi lee . what 's up ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what a pity !
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm glad to hear that . are you sure you can make it ?
and not expensive either .
yes of course . what 's the matter ?
yes please . but i do n't think so .
i am a graduate of university .
i wo n't say who because i 'm not sure yet . but i 'll know soon .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
i beg your pardon ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to .
well it 's not problem . i 'm glad you 're enjoying it .
yes . it is the most popular drinks .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i do n't know . maybe they are really crazy .
let me give you a hand .
thank you . i am afraid that they are all booked .
i hope so .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . we had to wait for early .
i ve been studying for my exams . i am doing a well .
ok . what are the items ?
yes . i 've been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally decided to quit my job and decided to take a vacation . i want to be a real family reunion .
that was a great idea . i 'm absolutely happy having a special dessert .
i have to go to the english corner .
i 've got to be going now too .
we can find some way to save up on our shopping . i think we can find a better one .
ok well you should get the hang of your life .
alright .
you 're welcome . now smile . . . .
that 's why i 'm thinking of taking you and enjoy the meal . it 's good for me to eat .
this is a good idea to start with . i 'm sure you will like it .
do n't worry about it . i know you are a good friend and that 's it .
maybe you are right . but what 's the news ?
yes . i 've already got a class on thursdays .
what a pity !
do you know anything about it ?
with pleasure sir .
we 'd like to do it by a famous company .
i think you should make some preparations . for example you should get more rest .
wow this is not easy . i 'm looking forward to doing business with my company .
haha ! the other day is <unk> than the end of the world !
i know where it is .
pretty good . i ve just been busy lately . how have you been ?
yes i 've prepared some l c documents all in one month . one of the things i 've got from you and there 's a copy of the meeting .
you had a little trouble on your parallel parking .
that 's very good . do you have a contract with the embassy in china ?
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
who wrote it ?
how do you wish to stay in touch ?
no i ll be too much .
oh yeah . we ll have winter holiday instead .
sounds good . i 'll do that .
that s a good idea .
well i would be glad to help . but now let s get together !
what 's up ?
and i m going to your black friends too . i m going to have a child .
i think so . are you going to get one in the early stages for a new one ?
i know but she looks quite depressed .
well i am afraid it is n't . what should we do ?
i have to go to the movies with a friend .
we re playing against hainan .
let 's do it . the special effects are good .
do you have a look at your computer ?
can i see the rainbow ?
are you nuts ?
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that would be great . what would you like to do with the pictures ?
and not expensive either .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
well i 'm planning on going abroad .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i do n't know . maybe they are really crazy .
wait a minute you mean you met them in our town ?
it 's not his day . he used to do his homework anyway .
i m not sure . i think they see other people who have created by monster . what do you think ?
because of the most important thing .
you know what ? it 's still very hard in the mountains .
that s fine ! don t worry about that . i ll just get back to the village !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i didn t know the end of the world !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that was it a long game . there were so many good candidates . first go to the top of the game .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i only want to check your driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't have a seat . i 'm in the middle of something .
what kind of movies are you thinking of going to ?
you ca n't have it . it 's not your fault .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
if they all unite on the same day you must be from washington d . c .
let 's go to the movies this weekend .
yes . what about you ?
well if you decide to go to the university you 'll have to wait for a while .
no i do n't like collecting things .
are they all right ?
it s about time .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
and not expensive either .
are you kidding ? it 's just what i think .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm not sure .
be seeing you then .
goodbye !
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
i 'll just have my money back right now .
i think it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
i don t care .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's interesting .
you re right . i wasn t looking for a person with him but he doesn t have a very good relationship .
yeah i think so . i 'm getting more fun .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please do n't worry about it .
yes . i like it very much . i was in the middle of the movie .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what i thought .
oh yes . i do n't know .
well we 're going to canada and it 's going to be there by ten and there are a lot of of of of of of passengers .
so find a guy to marry and you can get one !
sorry here is a gift for you . have you ever tried shopping ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
i 'm sorry to trouble you but i 've never made a reservation .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
it 's been nice talking to you .
yes i have . that s 7 fifteen . m . let s see . . . how do you know ?
yeah . i know .
it s a job i m not really happy with it .
we can t make it to the wedding .
is he just broke up with him ?
yeah . he s still got a <unk> his wife s head .
it s a sad thing . we just started a little while . . .
yes . they are a lucky man .
i know what my parents sometimes have to bring about is . i think we just have to make a big fan of tv programs .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i mean we could have a look at this other tshirt . i think it s going to be a good shot .
it s quite reasonable .
i see . i 'm from taiwan .
i guess that s a big family . how many children are there ?
i 've asked my parents to live with me . they want me to have a look at me .
yeah i know . it is hard to tell people like them . do n't they ever cook by ourselves ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we share the same cooking as a guest .
sounds good !
i have to write a check of the person who took care of the life insurance and the police wo n't come in .
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your consideration .
my brother and his sister is a businessman . i know more about him .
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
yes . i was told me you were coming to a concert this morning . but i saw a small restaurant called me . it was the first one .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we ll be the first step .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
i saw a ghost ? i mean that i hadn t been in the past but i wasn t even done it either . it s a real work of course .
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do n't you want to watch it ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be interested in having a big house with your parents ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess that 's the most important thing .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wonder if i could have a try .
yes well it s 30 dollars and i m allowed to use the money .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
oh i ve been out of town . i just got back .
how long did you stay there ?
no i went to visit my uncle . he lives in the united states and then i went to camp .
when to leave ?
yes . and i look forward to it .
let 's see . . . i think we 'd like to see the menu . have you made any ?
i m tom . nice to meet you susan .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
me ? i m not sure myself .
i guess i 'm from taiwan . i just wish i had n't been here long .
sometimes . i often work with my wife and i get the food done in the house .
i m not . i m sorry .
i don t go wrong with my parents .
we 're trying to get a new desk . i 'm afraid it 's not too far from the station .
it s very nice to meet you .
no i often send email to you . i am not sure i can find the time .
are you a freshman in college ?
sure i 've had a long time .
i ve got two tickets for my life . it s about time for you to go shopping .
yes i ve got it . thanks .
i really like that job .
wow . that s great . but i am thinking of making a long time .
we will visit a lot when i was at work .
you said it . but i still do n't know the good news .
well i 've only given one or two times a year .
when are you coming to los angeles ?
that sounds like a good plan .
what s your present permanent address ?
i asked her to beef up my clothes .
i guess i should go to her .
you should always have a choice of everything .
i did n't know . it was their first time . we could learn about it and see how to go .
i m sorry . i thought you were a very good employee .
but why is it so ?
that 's only 29 . 95 .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but we are often more careful in the environment .
you need to slow down .
yes . i 'm not going to be able to get up in time .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i 've got a really bad headache . . .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i like it very much .
star war .
i do n't think so . can i put it on the radio ?
i have n't got much .
i love it too . but i ca n't stand it any more .
but what really ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
when did you take the shuttle to the tower ?
very well . have you had the first time that you took your blood pressure ?
ok . i 'll start with the wine .
yes it is . please put your luggage on the scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good yet . they are still fighting about our products .
what about the price ?
the factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s a very good deal . i don t think the best problem is that there are much less expensive than rent .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm getting ready and the doctor 's passes .
haha . i do n't think so . it 's lucky that i got a chance to get a chance to speak here . well i am really enjoyed my job .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
ok you can trust me .
yes we are going to be in a minute .
not really . but i could n't do it very well .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you can take the right bus or the subway .
i m not in the mood .
well i think so .
but i still think it 's going to rain .
not really . i like autumn and autumn . the best season is to be a little too spring .
i think you can do some more exercise .
15 days .
how about tomorrow ?
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
well i must be off for you to come in .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i agree . we should go and play some time .
it 's about 200 years old .
yeah . that s all right . i ll see how it is .
i ll pick you up around 6 o 'clock . do you have any dry cleaned ?
is it because of the bad weather ?
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from america . so i 'm from america .
really ? how long have you been there ?
oh i love you too .
no i m not . i like flowers myself .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i love you too .
may i see it ?
that s true . but not for a long time . you know how to take public transport system to us .
well then it s really nice and easy .
ok . let s go and see if there s a problem .
that may be what i m going to do .
are you worried about anything ?
yes . i ll write to you once i get settled . but not at least .
do you like it ?
merry christmas ! mr bean .
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .

i go occasionally when there 's a game on near home but usually i watch it on tv .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i 'm sorry i ca n't agree with you . our team has done a lot of work on it .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i have a few questions about my lease .
that 's okay .
i got a job offer from dell .
right sir .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no i 'm a nurse .
that s correct .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
that 's not bad . she can make your own decisions .
that 's true . but anyway the basic man who knows she should have a crush on those people .
well when the new year is always due .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
what happened to your parents ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
could you tell me something about it ?
really ? i do n't think so . it 's just that he 's been friendly with anyone and just a friend .
maybe it 's just the matter . they are completely different .
no but i 've got to take some more photos this time .
i will have to do my best .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that all you can make it ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh your mother is very happy . her mother is married .
ok . now you re more than my friend .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
that 's sad but have you gone to the movies recently ?
i think that it 's going to be a few weeks from now .
so you 've just got a promotion .
i think that it s just that you are making a big mistake .
oh yes . what s up ?
hi david .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
what did you think ?
oh yes . and i ve never seen anything like it !
how come ?
i 'm not sure what she looks like .
and he was trying to do something wrong with it . you know he was obviously a <unk> .
yes that sounds fine .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
stay just a few minutes longer ok ?
you do n't know ?
she s been shopping for a couple of years . she s always been a genius saleswoman !
you are so lucky . i was only there in the evenings .
at the end of next year .
i 'll be there .
yes . i 'm sure it 's going to be her birthday .
how are you doing ?
but that 's the case .
yeah that s great !
if the new bride has been married for us .
i am sure it will take about 5 minutes .
we 've been fishing in europe . i 'm sure they 're coming to visit us .
i thought it was o . k . but it s my job .
yeah . but that s life . you know he has been together for a long time .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
he works as a mother .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
ok easy . it 's just your turn . if he does n't hurt you should put on a black suit and tie .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do n't worry about that . i can not find anything wrong with it .
perhaps you should invite her to dinner with her .
but i think they 're trying to scare the young people so they do n't ever start smoking .
i m not sure i know . i guess we ll have to meet again sometime .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
oh that 's true . i 'm afraid i 'll change my job .
well it 's true . people wo n't give up . it 's a shot .
thank you again for that . i hope so .
i thought that i would marry our new president .
you do n't have to pay for it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
you are right . we will have to work on fine day .
well i 'm sorry . i forgot to tell you that i 'm going to clean it up .
how much do you want to spend ?
yeah i 'm sure i know what it 's about . do you know how i 'm taking it ?
listen carol . you are a good friend . what do you think of this job ? you can t be serious .
have you tried wrong with someone ? you are a good friend .
ok . thanks for coming .
thank you for your hospitality .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
i will appreciate you if you have any questions while you are here .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .

yes that 's right .
i 'm most grateful .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early . but it 's already so hard to remember .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
thanks for helping me .
thanks for your help .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
and when are you moving ?
i think i 'm glad you 're right . i love swimming .
do you have any idea how long it will take to get there ?
a couple of times .
are there many people there ?
well i see . anyway the goods are not <unk> or at the moment . i do n't think they have their own er . .
yeah . and they promised to stick together forever when they were young .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if he did n't say but he would n't .
i love it . but i do n't like doing it very much . this is my first time to dance .
oh what kind of music do you like ?
i like all kinds of stuff . i like almost all the time .
well i do n't mind in the first moment i 'll be on it . i 'd like to change my work .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i 'll do it .
no he 's still being alone .
are you sure you 're making a decision ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
that s really tough .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
please fill out the form .
oh yes . hey that 's a great idea . i thought you had something to drink .
ok i see .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
you should be happy i want you to look good . if i let you shop for yourself you would never buy anything .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i do n't think there are any good bands playing on the mountain .
no he must be her fourth .
well i had the guts to help .
what 's going to be ?
the problem is that i think he 's getting old .
it 's too good to know that he is a lawyer .
i feel a little tired .
you see . i think you 'd better stay in bed today .
maybe so but i think it will be better if you do n't mind .
i sure would .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
oh you are right . ok i 'll have a try .
do you have any identification ?
no . it 's the fourth time .
what kind of movie are you going to do ?
it 's true . the li looks like her husband is on the fourth floor .
what would you do if you were in
sure thank you .
yes i 've been through a lot today .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i know . but all i do is know the exact time . can i leave a message ?
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
please drive slowly .
the buck stops here . it s hard to know .
oh i see . don t worry about it . oh i m so sorry .
oh look ! i can see . do you think we ll ever get something to eat ?
thanks . things are different in different ways .
do you think i will ever see that xray again ?
ok .
yes i was just opening a copy of your computer and thought it was going to be a great time .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
it s true . but i m afraid i can t afford it .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i don t know but i don t think we ll get a better price than our boss .
so what s going to do ?
it was a very good school .
yes it s just a small percentage of <unk> .
all right . i ll have a try . what s the movie waiting for ?
oh that s unbelievable . congratulations !
really ? it 's a large one . she also has an amazing voice .
you know that he could use a different world . you know he d better than this old one .
ok i will !
i like that ! are you nuts ? it s almost the <unk> ?
it is the special local time . you never know what you 're going to have to wear .
no i never knew that ! i 'm too nervous !
it was n't that bad .
yeah really !
yeah i guess so . that s really sweet of you .
well i am really looking forward to it .
sounds like you 'll have to .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
we 'd like a little sugar please .
would you like some soup with that ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . . . um . . . yes that 's paul .
i got a job offer from dell .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was planning to get the car and then go to the top of the stairs .
that s wrong . he ran a red light but he did n't know how to do that .
i m very worried . i hope everything will be settled .
are you serious ? you ve been friends for years ! what are you talking about ? we ve been friends for a while now !
thanks for the information . i ll see you tomorrow .
you think it s better that she should take a few minutes to get on .
it 's really special .
dad it s raining outside . where are you going ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the other one . . . yes .
where do mangoes come from ?
ok . you 're such a geek !
there 's been a very good chance for us to see you again .
if you could at it in a minute i 'll be studying to apply for some reason .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
oh i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them but i m not kidding .
how about some fried chicken !
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
have you done any work in this field ?
yeah i 'd love to .
he 's giving me the money .
well if i were you i 'd never stop and learn to get a good manager .
i wanted to attend it last month .
that 's cool . but i 'm sure you 'll have a good time .
to the beach please . i need to find a sweater .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be most expensive . what should we do ?
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
at 8 o 'clock . and it will be back at 8 00 p . m .
then do i have to pay for the cable ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about this one ? it sounds like a good deal . how about the rent ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
apparently it 's been a long time . i hate to go to bed .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
i 'm not a beautiful woman . i just like it very much .
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
great . i 've been very busy recently . so i 'm having a chance to come over and celebrate my birthday . what is your birthday ?
yes i have . i 'm looking for a pair of shoes on the internet .
what do you think are the main teachers ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it 's worth the time .
yes it was a great meal . but it was not a very expensive deal .
well it 's unfair . but i am afraid the price is too low .
definitely . oh well how time flies !
you married him right ?
we should come here more often .
yeah . it 's true that americans have to keep up with their life and way of thinking .
it 's true . love is one thing starving oneself to be neighbors .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
i was thinking of it . i 'm still not too much of a paper .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too early to tell the truth i do n't think you 'll have any problems .
i feel they 're dirty .
the idea of doing that . i think you re right .
that 's not true . some people believe you 'll feel much better than others .
i heard that the chinese people in the book are experts with special performance . but there are a lot of options .
i agree . in fact chinese people are not so popular at the moment . so i 'll try more chinese dishes and italian .
will you take some time ?
you know on a date they are going out to dinner .
oh she is a bad girl . i must have just been so tired .
she is a famous dog for piano with a nice girl .
so the room is small for those . ok ! now let 's get started .
do you know that ?
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he was an excellent chinese teacher . but he had promised him that she would take a chance to practice speaking .
he said he had a mask on his face .
haha . actually it is a time to be one of your friends . we have a lot of congratulations on this .
i 'd be willing to but i 'm sure he 'll be able to help me do it .
don t worry . that s a good idea . . . you ve got to go . what you need is a vacation for ?
ouch that hurts did you have to mention your name ?
i heard it 's a <unk> .
that 's great news .
my car run out of petrol .
i know . but we chinese think you should be able to learn from each other .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's right . he 's at home until 1200 o 'clock in the morning .
yes . everyone in my country is making us look more special .
do you know how to use a pc to process the internet ?
you have no idea . and i like her . she s always <unk> for his own money .
i have the same idea . as you know i have a business model and a business english teacher . a lot of the same thing . sometimes i think you need to learn more about the same at a time .
the main thing is that our restaurant is well trained in western europe . the chef and i ve heard that there are many indian thai and italian restaurants and italian restaurants all over the world . .
what a pity . are you doing anything tomorrow ?
fine with me but we do n't have a good idea . do you want to order an appetizer for us ?
great idea . i love it .
are the workers provided by a good staff for training ?
but we could get a more money in this community . i think we should start flat by little .
there 's a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
well people from asia to europe all enjoy their seafood .
come on ! it 's easy to make a decision . even if the kids stay out a little more .
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
good idea . do you think i ll shop by bus ?
it s about 20 minutes walk . how do you like the train ?
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
well they re very good . how about the interest ?
do you have a longterm plan for your career ?
you know on a date they are going out to dinner .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
come on . you can be more comfortable in the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the world .
that 's right . i was afraid to say that .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad . they like good meal .
no they are n't . they are ripe and tasty .
do you have any chinese food ?
we ask that many people who are on the first floor of the street are on the bus .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
that 's great . i like meeting you there . but i 'm not sure if you would want to go to the gym .

because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press conferrence and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work

i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
do n't forget it 's friday nighty . if frankfurt 's anything like london everybody will be leaving for the weekend . it 's a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly .
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .

it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you will be able to find a job on the internet . besides there are a lot of new things you should know .

alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .

they give us a lot of initiative . i see .
well they should have a special promotion for your family .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
are there any other ways to get more benefits ?
quite well . all my salary is a bit low and more . how many do they survive in each year ?
yes . do you offer any opportunities to go to ?
have you ever been to a public school or a private school ?
how do you know about your son ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a lot about foreign languages and a computer training course .
so you was the only teachers in the book . that is according to the only one .
i learned that what i thought . i learned that speaking in high school .
i certainly do . but my school was very good .
did you enjoy yourself there ?
i took a lot of experience in the college and i took english as my minor subject at university .
yes i do . i find it very informative . it always has plenty of experience in this field .
what does the notice say ?
we expect you to finish a little later .
that s a good idea . we have been thinking of buying a car for five days .
i 'm afraid that 's too much for me .
oh let me see . i am interested in the economic development of china .
when do you think you 'll be chinese ?
well it 's so small . i do n't think we have any trouble finding a job in the house .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got some paper and my dad 's going to travel abroad .
what does the notice say ?
i am sorry i have no idea .
but thank you very much all the same .
are there any other business opportunity for me to take care of ?
i don t know anything about it . i just want to know the importance of time .
how do you feel about working for another company ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
but that is not the right way to learn it .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ?
well what do i do after i write a list of all the things i need to know ?
in this case you should pay more attention to the details of your business .
you can nod or ask questions at the right time .
never should we interrupt on a unfamiliar topic .

the purpose of the law is to know the general and law of human resources management .
really ? which one would you like ?
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
am i allowed to have my job ?
sure what is a greatest weakness ?
what can i do ?
as you know i am a student at university and have a job in english . i can also take a job that is more important than other companies .
i know . i need to take a look at these books and get it from my home .
you 're lucky .

i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i would like to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
hi i 'm glad to hear that . are you free on saturday ?
maybe but it 's my favorite work . i 'm in a hurry .
i 'm going to go for a pizza .
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs parttime people . that s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not sure it will be difficult to get a gold .
but you are too slow to watch right now . it 's not as bad as it is .
sure . who do you think will be ?
well i 'm not too much of a person so i do n't care about how much i want to spend on my time with you .
yes it was . but this was a great game .
well you are welcome . good luck !
i know . but i am really busy .
how about a game of bridge ?
ok i 'll look into that .
of course not . that 's why i 'm here .
yes it would be nice .
i had been doing quite well . as reach 90 and bs reach 100 . and i ve been awarded zu jingle scholarship two times .
what was your major at university ?
because the company is far away from home and i have to study after work so i decided to study after work .
you have no experience but i am sure you will like it .
i like playing chess .
because your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
oh i see . i will try my best to assist you if any questions you want .
i think that it 's a great idea . studying abroad will offer you a better position .
ok . it sounds fine to me . i think you 'll be a good fit in this position . as you know we are looking for a higher pay .
yes i am . i am liu ming .
nice to meet you mr . li . we have learned about that you are coming to the interview .
actually i 'm leaving here as an assistant .
it 's not far away then . let 's walk it up .
i m jack . i 'm from taiwan . i came here to see her again .
here 's ten yuan . keep the change .
yes . there are many english schools in the neighborhood . and there are more visitors in the state .
what are your major expectations ?
i am studying languages .
accountancy ? really ? how long have you been there ?
yes i have been working on it for a whole year .
how was your spare time ?
i like playing chess .
how do you spend your spare time ?
i am very good at speaking in public . i won t be able to help my professional skills .
how do you know about your english ?
how do you mr . white ? my name is li ming here is my card .
nice to meet you mr . li . we have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . as you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle we 'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm .
we 're glad to hear that . but it 's just too small to be a planet but actually we are looking for the construction of our products .
no i have n't had a look at it . i saw the exhibits on the street .
but we need a lot of space for our quality .
ok .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
you mean i am on a <unk> ?
is that so ?
absolutely . take my word for it .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok thank you . i 'll try to speak to her mr . baker right away .
what is this made of ?
good . what are your biggest weakness ?
that 's right . my friend says we should get off the financial report by mr . green .
so we must take a survey to rest . you 're right now we are in a hurry .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
we are sorry to interrupt you . what about the price ?
where s yours at ?
yes i have . i met with her last week . she said i was very pleased with the photography .
but how will you be located ?
yes . the prices here are very high . they are reasonable .
but that 's the most important thing .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
well . we should be able to reduce the price by 10 percent . if we take down payment we 'll consider giving you a discount .
the last thing you should do is to tell our general manager that our company will provide you with a lot of training . if your order is up to you i know the required items you should be happy with them .
i said mr . thomas there is a problem with his work .
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what s wrong with my hair ? it s definitely a good thing .
you know on a date they are going out to dinner .
well it s a very good idea . a very good thing i don t think .
what about the expression goodbye ?
it depends on the job and the boss .
yes . the problem is that there are a lot of websites about that .
no really ?
so i want to watch a movie and have a soda . that 's all i 'm really tired .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
you should n't be so sure about it .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
sounds good . you 'll be there around 6
that 's right . some people pay too much attention to what they do .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around and you re really dumb with me .
well there is a good range of plant that catches insects and eats them .
well i know mr . parsons as a secretary i don t think we have enough time to work in a company car and we have a job with him .
have you ever thought about this a job ? if there 's something more to do a smaller job than that .
the <unk> generation ipod shuffle is a <unk> player and a professional story of kind of character .
then what about a slow dance ?
wow ! the company is very lucky . they are n't very large rooms .
but just started working here at the new job .
company has a chance to work on it . they will get married and we still look at the employees every year .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i am quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
what is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing in 2002 .
ok i see .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
of course . but we 'll be able to keep the distance from each other .
can you read and write english well ?
yes pretty well . i have started learning english since primary school .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
oh i do n't think you want to be a good lesson .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so what did you do for this position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . what 's the charge for euro ?
can you manage english conversation ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
what is this made of ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . what did you think of that ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what a pity ! now you have to leave a new company car and only a half hours .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
ok i will send them to you in a week .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes . they are half an hour in all .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
all right madam .
what are they ?
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

you did a horrible job on my hair .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
they said they 'd better go over the holidays .

they caught him before he could walk through the front door .

it seems you have to take time .
i do n't know .
ok . now wasn t it ?
did you have a good journey ?
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
then you should 've got some homework .
i need to go to the police station .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
i was in a hurry . it was how could it be ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that . maybe the police will turn on us .
i 've seen a few other kind of news .
let 's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .
were you able to 100 people ?
what did the odds of finding a man ?
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
you know on a date they are going out to dinner .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
they 've just bought a special promotion for me .

you mean the car is still in the mail ?
i would like to make my plea .
i am pleading not guilty .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i do n't think there are any other words .
what are you saying ?
where s your polling place ?
i hate to disappoint you but that s not my fault . have you ever been there any problems ?
there are n't many people .
i don t think this place is for you .
how much do you charge ?
i guess not . i think the woman was better than the first sight of it . but actually they think it 's a bit loud .
i know . you can trust him .
there were two more them .
who was the letter from ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's a good idea .
if you break the contract then you will pay two yuan for the service .
well . i think you 're a little young . and i really want to have a try .
ok . it 's a deal . let 's go check it out .
when ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well mr . brown . i m happy to say it s nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .
because i was n't feeling well so i 'm sick .
it is unnecessary .
he got the money and tried to leave .
yeah there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
i do n't think i 'm wrong .
she looks like you 're going to have to get her a chance to get her a hold of her .
i think i know it 's mostly my fault . but if you go for a while i 'll still have the class to go to and get it fixed .
how do you think of this one ?
i got a job offer from dell .
still it seems that it makes sense to me .
i think that 's the beauty of the tea .
are you sure you 're right ?
they showed how they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
let me see . . . a glass of orange juice .
it was not a problem . considering that much i got to pay .
it seems they are their appointment .
no i have n't .
i m fine .
she s going to be able to help us choose a new one and he just has the right to give me a chance .
that 's true . i 'm always up for new hotels . but i do n't think we should spend much time at home .
perhaps you should call the company first .
in that case . i guess the doctor says ten after the long run .
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
have you noticed the people who have been <unk> there ?
yes . we have . we used to do that on a flight .
who s that ?
it s not just that . i don t feel right at home .
certainly . i m going to have a pet dog or a cat .
really ? who s that ?
and they lack originality .
what are the most important thing to learn ?
i 'd like to come back to my hotel this afternoon . what can i do for you ?
sure here you are . all right here are your receipt .

thanks for your help .
yes we do . just want to make an appointment .
oh that seems perfect .
yes what do you need ?
yes . what 's the charge for euro ?

then what do i need to do ?
and how many would you like to pay for these ?
ok . could you tell me when i want to come back ?
if you really want to .
oh right of course . what 's this ?
yeah . can i look at this ring ?
do you have any direct ones ?
the lady at the desk shelly i think told me you offer many other consultancy services .
oh i see .
how many cigarettes do you provide ?
ah i can change that right ?
certainly madam . when do you want to move in ?
i would like to send it by 100 yuan .
for the bank manager ?

if you take a 10 day you will have to pay two yuan a month .
ok . i will think about it . well thanks very much .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?

thanks . ok . . . . . your balance is 320214 rib . how much do you require today ?
how many departments do you booked in the hotel ?
you re welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh yes . that 's it hot is n't it ?
yes . i suppose we must be able to do something else to help us . what about the insurance company ?
i 'm sorry . we are not authorized to deal with high orders .
that 's right . why not cartons are quite high in the box ?
i 'm sorry . but this is the first time i 've been to business . i 'll see you on the market .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
could you explain the importance of such packing ? the goods are quite complicated .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i did . what should i do now ?
we 've already got to offer you as many kinds of boxes .
the packing is very high . the goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation .
ok i will take that .
i 'm afraid that they are too nervous to do things . they are just allowed to take them away .
i am majoring in international trade .
you 're right . we are looking forward to our maintenance right now .
good . can you tell me the best of the product ?
oh i see . can i have a try it on ?
it 's a reasonable price . we ca n't quote it .
but i suppose you are not the only one who has done a lot of other people .
yes i really appreciate that .
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
all right . what 's the size of the french memory ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
that 's nice . can you read the characters ?
it 'll be hard to meet you at the last minute . and it 'll be here about two or three hours .
it 's good to be home .
oh i 'm sorry . i do n't think i 'm too tired .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
i 'm most grateful .
now everything is in order . let me have a look at it . is there anything else we can do for you mrs . smith ?
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
our company is very strict with its work . we are sure to do something about it .
of course . it 's a pleasure to meet you . have you got to sign up for the whole course ?
but the gap is still too great for us to guarantee .
i 'm afraid i do n't think i 'm lucky . i mean would n't have any easy to say .
oh that 's too bad . we only accept our price .
i am afraid we are a poor commission . we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal .
how many months of the business do you have in mind ?
oh i 'm sorry . i 've never been there . i 'm afraid of making a double major changes .
yes . when you hear it change that means you could set up the alarm .
he has a very good idea of how long it will be .
i heard in your country you can accept d .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
is the price negotiable ?
i am very sorry . we are fully committed at the moment .
i think i 'll buy some of that . but i think our price is competitive .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree to that . we only accept the payment .
so i must study chinese about it .
thank you again !
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
when is your date of delivery ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is really comfortable to living .
it s all right . where are you going ?
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . mr . bradley your room number is 6020 . it is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . here is your key card with all the information on your booking the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the daily rate . please make sure that you have it with you all the time . you sign in for your meals and the restaurants and
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what is your date of delivery ?
all right . we accept your offer .
i hope you can make it .
what 's the address ?
let me see . well i think we 've already shipped the goods by june 30 and the second of october . may i have your name and the reservation number ?
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
i should n't say that .
we need to discuss it with our manager .
well i see . can you give me your offer ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
and we can make it as soon as possible .
it depends on the basis of your sales .
why not ? we will send it to you a normal price .
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
well it 's too early to say that . we ca n't pay the price for each piece .
that sounds like a good idea . i was thinking of your credit score on it .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if i could accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well . we accept all major credit cards .
yes you can .
no i ca n't . i 'm lefthanded .
what kind of pain ? sharp pain dull pain or severe pain ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .

here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
it does n't matter . but i still have to pay my bills .

i see . how do i draw money from my news then .
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . how much would you like to withdraw ?
of course we 'd be happy to .

what is the rate for ?
can i see the room now ?
here is your change . please wait for the registered mail .
where is the fitting room ?
this is the largest machine producer in the apartment . it 's been making a reservation for just a <unk> . it 's been making a big mistake i think it 's about the time of a deposit .
good morning . could you tell me where i can find the clothing department ?
good morning .
sure . our bank is in ericsson tower no . 12 like east street chaoyang district .
i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
is it really cheap ?
i do at a different location i have a savings account and a cd .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here is my id card .

oh that is almost impossible .

ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
you 'll be fined 20 yuan for the rest of your total charge .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
it 's my pleasure . what would you like to drink milk tea coffee orange juice or iced water ?
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think so . should we put together teams in different departments ?
not in a million years !
i ve been away on a business trip . so i wouldn t have been out of the town .
but what do you think about money ?
he 's a guy of a <unk> .
oh i see . how much are you depositing ?
only 20 dollars .
do i have to pay a card ?
no . but now i m going to buy a new one .
ok i will take my bag !
did you have a good journey ?
i think you re a better friend . i think you re going to have to give me a chance but what 's your budget ?
movies have a question .
some more chinese tea for us please .
we do have to buy more but they don t have the money for our country !
you know ? i had no idea .
what are the internal factors that influence the company ?
i think that the best we can do is fill in this transfer form and ask the picture of your card .
in the company s resolution and i m not really happy with the attention of the game .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
i was really calling to attend the first half of april .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
a new year is something i need to do .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
i see . and how many tickets do they have ?
the price can be talked over . how much is the price ?
what 's the price ?
well as i said before i sign the contract i can assure you that your price is the best price we can work .
mr . smith .
the price can be talked over . could you give me a special price ?
yes i got it . but i ve been working here for over a year .
i m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
