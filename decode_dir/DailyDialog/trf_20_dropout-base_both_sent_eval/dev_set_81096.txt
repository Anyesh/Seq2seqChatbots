thanks . i will .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
i used to take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's great . thanks for the offer .
ok .
hi .
oh i m sorry to hear that . would you like me to go with you ?
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .

well of course . which one would you like to 10 yuan ?
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's great . thanks for the offer .
well you 'd better take an additional course or a gym .

i think a cab is better .

then i guess you re right . ok i ll take it .
i 'm clear so far .

do you want it with everything ?
yes . i 'd like to have a crab soup .
we have two dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
i 'd like to try traditional chinese medicine .
i m afraid i can t do that . would you like to order some appetizer before the end of the month ?
yes i ll have an ice tea . you see it next to the lemonade .
he 's a bit careless . he gets angry and does n't mean he 's very tall and he can do anything .
yeah he is . he is indeed a genius .
if you told him that your parents took a double room to be macho a .

it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
how far is it ?
do you take care of them everyday ?
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
turn right at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
is it a long run to the station ?

then you are not far away from here .
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it is in the library .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
oh yes . it 's not far from here . you have to go there .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . the first thing to go to the top of the stores and other small schools .
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes of course i really wanted to buy one . i had to buy some candies and then i spent most of my own to show my parents around me .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
this one ? that s the one . she knows that these women are the largest competitor in love .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !

and i agree with all his policies .
i am sorry you have to leave so early . you should try to find out your best .
it is . let s have a try .
i don t know whether i am going to make her own .
the third problem is now .
how about the yellow mountains ?
good ! i love chinese food .
well i know about the factory . so i do n't know what to do .
let 's go to the bedroom and get some fresh air .
no thanks . that will be all .
how would you like to go ?
i 'd like a gin and tonic .
i 'll have a sandwich and small fries . would you like to have some desserts ?

yes . that 's the one .
this morning we rented a car and we are on the way to <unk> falls . i 'm afraid we have a car accident near the border .
i think i can have a dish of beef .
what 's the advantage about its name ?
630 . my room number is 305 .
that sounds great .
wow a remote car model and my favorite brand . i really like it . that is so nice of you .
i like collecting things . i 'm interested in different things .
i heard about that . the rent is much more expensive than the public interest rate .
which one ?
and one more thing smile widely .
i know i still have n't seen you for ages . how is it ?
that 's what i want ! i m going to do the same thing .
i think the most important thing is that the company will be paid attention to the company as well as they are of good quality and they are not only reasonable .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes and they play with a very well .
would you like to register now ?

so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
stirred or shaken ?
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .

can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
great . how many chances are you going to have ?
do you think you can get me there seven thirty ?
enjoy yourself .
i have done that . thank you for the offer .
oh my god ! i do n't like cooking any more .
that 's great . i 'll have a try .
well then there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
i do n't think i can have some .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding me ?
yup they are . <unk> though the taste of steamed fish is not very thick .
i would like to have the guest glass .
i 'm sure i 'll enjoy it .
hold on . i have to get her desk .
let me have the babyback ribs .
come on ! i 'll tell you a thing about food !
oh yes . that 's the best thing to go to .
cool ! that 's easy for john . what 's that ?
i m ok .
thanks . let s go dutch .
i 'm most grateful .
it 's really delicious . the food was terrific .
is there any other kind of food in taiwan ?
what are the ingredients ?
they all have just come out of the states . do you know the four places that have ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
i prefer the tv play on the tv .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
maybe we 're just talking .
you are right . the work is really hard .
does she know anything about her ?
okay . first you need to fill out the form and the application .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well let me check the sales department .
thank you . i think i will go to the library at 6 p . m .
okay i 'll get you some water .
are you scared of anything ?
we have a requisition form on the company web site . what type of supplies do you want ?
how do you feel about hiring that <unk> to come and work ?
may i know what you do ?
that 's a good idea .
do you want to sit near the window ?
that 's strange .
don t worry . i m sure it s a big issue .
some more chinese tea for us please .
what about tomorrow ?
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that sounds fine . she 'll come back soon .
i ll call the police if we can get up .
i see .
i 'd better take a taxi .
yes sir . you wo n't be able to make your call in and show your family to your coworkers .
ok ! i sounds like to know what she said .
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
well i hope i can have a chance .
he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
by the way she will be there . she will come and visit us in a few minutes .
i see . you would like to have a different dress but i would n't be able to concentrate on her own .
what does she do for a man ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you have any questions about your lease you can take .
i 've got something a friend . i like her concert with my friends . she was too tired .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
mr . smith please . we would like to book a table for the next 12 days .

so how about coming with me to dinner ? i 'm sure i 'll have a good time .
thanks . i 've got it .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
that sounds like a good idea .
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
i 'm sick of not um . . . why ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well i guess you can help me with the <unk> .
well i do n't know why .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yes you will . have a look at the rate .
it 's very easy .
ok . i 'll take one .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
so let 's get registered tomorrow .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .

why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .

i didn t say i d already decided dad . i said it was for me to decide . there is a difference .
oh . so you think you can just do whatever you want do you ?
i didn t say that either . i was hoping we could discuss the matter together . i want your advice but i don t want you to tell me what to do . i ve got to make decisions for myself dad .
do n't <unk> to come straight home after school .
you 're really lucky . let me have a look .

so i have to get up now .
do n't worry you 'll find a suitable car in the last few years .
thank you . no i m glad to hear that .
so if we can get some meat then we can ask the bellboy to pick up the garage .
it 's very complicated . but i do n't think the quality of the machines are the same products .
i do n't think so . it 's just that the sort of thing is wrong with my hands .
you must go to the dentist .
that 's right .
what are you doing ?
i think it 's much better now .
sure . take on after the trip .
and after the tax your total is 32 . 42 . would you like to have any other safety ?
that 's my opinion .
it 's a very good idea . take your time .
what 's the rent for a year ?
it 's ten feet and the color never fades .
it 's made in china . it was made by the city .
i wanted to but he said no .
i thought you had a man with jack jack jack jack just before the exam .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
oh dear ! i 'll show you how my mom did n't lose it .
what ? i just feel tired right now .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
how often do you think it could be ?
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you re welcome . glad to hear that .
i 'm going to get one for myself . they make really good coffee here .
yes please . is there a problem ?
do you want to take any money out ?
well when will it be paid ?
so you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ?
your flight takes off at 8
can you finish it on time ?
i am not busy tomorrow . call me then .
yes that 's all .
could you deliver it for me please ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well it 's cheap and convenient .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
it would be nice to have some money taken . but i really need to think about it .
twenty dollars .
can you describe their taste ?
it does n't matter . i 'll laugh at you .
but they are n't . they are really a bit matched game .
where do people go to get grow mangoes ?
i like this style . i think i 'll take some too .
most of them are from america and europe .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

well this one might work for you .

you mean it s a bit cheaper but not a lot of money .
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
are you kidding ? what am i going to do with my money ?
here s our list . you ll be happy to get the ball rolling in it .
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .

yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher and trash compacter .

the one would be nice .

well i am lucky to be in such a big family . i think you 'd better get a tie .
i do n't have the same problem .

yes . why not ?
yes i 'd like to know about it .
my parents parents parents live there at the airport on july 21st century poetry . i have to be there right now .

do you have anything to declare ?
down to his shoulders . it 's beautiful like gold .
how do you find it ?
the internet has n't been the best quality for its popularity . many of the buyers are moving very well .
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
well let 's go over there .
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
would you like to buy a new one ?

which one would you like to recommend ?

well i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be responsible and that 'll cause you a lot of inconvenience too .

maybe you can try some steak .
let s go and get a burger .
yes you 'd better take a heavy sweater .
would you like another beer ?
they 're delicious .
i would like to have a try .
let 's go to the local flea market . then we have a lot of museums and people .
any place will be fine . you make the decision .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
i 'm looking forward to seeing the great weather .
it s <unk> .

i m not driving a car . you re so cheap .
i do n't know .
it s almost the same .
that 's terrible !
how can it be interesting to see the famous trends ?
oh that s great . i m glad we can do something together .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
no thanks . i 'm afraid i wo n't .
what 's the cause ?
i would rather you like to but i m not really sure .
oh i m afraid . he won t . i ve got to take a cab home .
oh that was the first thing we did .
is there a large coke ?
i think something must be done .
did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
come on . i 'll tell you all about it .
where are you going to work ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
how about this place ? it s been great to have you been here .
ok . i ll send someone to your office .
certainly . i ll send you a different apartment .
what about my rights ?
do you have a medium in the same color ?
thank you . i had a secretary with this morning .
where to ?
wangfujing please !
the square is falling apart and the hotel is falling apart !
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
ok see you then .
my train will leave at 300 i 'll have to arrive there before 250 .
is there anything you can do for me ?
here 's twenty dollars .
only 308 per night .
oh i see .
thank you . have a nice day .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where are you heading sir ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
well it s a long way to go . i am sorry sir . there is no ticket available on that day .
hey !
how much is the ticket for ?
here is ten dollars .
it s under the couch .
you are kidding !
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
ok i am happy to hear that .
thank you . i hope i can stay in your hotel tonight .
oh hi angela it 's dan .
that 's ok .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
yes i am . i really don t know anyone .
can i have my 200 please ?
ok . let me think about it .
sounds good . what did you do ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course not . just tell me your phone number .
ok . thank you .
when can i get it ?
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when is he coming back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
oh hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
come on . my bad birthday is in beijing .
very good . are you enjoying your job ?
i 've been working really hard .
doing your own work ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh thank you . i am sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad to talk to you .
she 's my roommate .
since i first met my wife about three years .
i ll get back to work .
she 's handsome . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what if she was n't as clever as you .
yeah i 'm not really into the city but i know it 's one of my favorites . how do you like it ?
a good idea . would you like to go to the liked club or the news ?
but what 's on tomorrow ?
ok . i 'll come . see you tomorrow night .
i 'll be there . so are you sure ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you 're going to have to clean your ticket up the cooker .
you can t just blow my nose will you ?
wow ! i could really use this ! you know i ve got a hard day !
what happens if you ca n't break the car ?
great ! phew ! that was a close one ! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
oh yeah ! i get it ! hey just watch out of the lipstick . . .
who is your favorite computer game ?
are you kidding ? what s the problem ?
i m looking for a sweater .
oh you seem to like a light even if it s a little bit expensive .
i d like a compact please . how long does it take ?
and ?
so you can say that i like return the song at the moment .
no i m just browsing . if you have a seat you can go there .
thank you for your help .
i see that s pretty much trouble .
okay here s a list of chores we need to get done . i hope i can help you prepare for the worst thing .
i don t like that . why do you buy an inexpensive camera ?
wait a minute ! that 's the most famous one in america !
i don t really like that much . why do you want to buy it ?
what 's it look like ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
no . i 've been a little tired . and i ca n't get a sore throat .
okay i ll just have it ready .
thanks . i ll bring your money back to you .
do you have anything else ?
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
that 's going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
i went to harvard university .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you like roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
yes and i can lend it to you if you 'd like .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have such a great time ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had my first day with a terrible call .
so don t use any damage it the floor .
oh good come on . you ve been working too hard anyway .
she likes to have the same thing in the city . though she was small i ca n't believe it would have to be the person who knows .
oh good come on .
i don t think the best way it is .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size ? these are the latest fashion .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you can get off at the next stop and walk back . it 's not far .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that s very quiet and easy .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
only we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
where are you going to find one ?
can we have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s fine .
it ll be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
please do .
well i ll think it s the best way to go .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i bought some things online yesterday .
yeah the food is nice but its color is so light and clean .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
okay . do you have anything else ?
maybe the best . i want a new apartment .
i m afraid there s a bit of a problem . he has the same dress in the dark .
maybe you have a point . you can get a discount on the market .
i don t want to get you something else . i think we should get something else on the high street .
all right . i ll be back and get the sports set .
yes . and we can also take some photos of the latest fashion .
i do n't know what size we 're doing . what do you have ?
o . k . here you are . anything else ?
i would like to try on a different color .
yes she s back of her own library .
yes sir your dish will be ready by 700 .
you are there on the apartment .
i am calling to inquire about the position of pr manager . what requirements does the job need ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
great ! i like it and it 's a nice neighborhood .
i will be at the apartment today . there is a lot of noise in the apartment .
good . i will see you then .
it s fine . i 'll be back in a minute . i can have my name and phone number .
no i think i 've got enough .
okay . let me know when you are ready to place the rest of your order .
should i bring anything with me ?
we 'll need to use the atm .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes i know . the price has been reduced by five . it s the same kind of thing .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
ok . which direction do i go to ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it .
the rooms are quite different and there s a very nice view from the balcony .
what about cash ?
why do n't you just get it fixed ?
is you right ? i think we need the dark <unk> to get out of the building .
ok great .
would you please remind me to get a snack in the middle of the hotel ?
i am going to buy some clothes in my shop .
just one . i think we have six .
that is exactly what i was thinking . i think it 's a good idea to offer a little more expensive but it 's worth every place .
ok it s a bunch of room .
i m glad to hear that .
i don t know . let me see .
it 's my girlfriend . i 'll buy it for you . it 's our daughter 's birthday next week .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
i thought you should throw some paper into the bathroom . let 's go check it out .
here is my receipt .
that s my wife .
this is the property manager . how can i help you ?
hello this is bob . i was calling to tell you that you had a wonderful time .
it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i would love to hear the apartment .
i am happy to hear that .
yes . i 've got to go with the dentist .
have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?
i 'm okay . well i 'll see you then .
we are ourselves .
that 's fine . i 'll be back in a couple of days .
we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine .
yes are you available now ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i 'm afraid i have n't tried english . but i just can ask you some questions if you have any questions .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
my permission letter ?
about 60 dollars .
can i have my 200 please ?
no . you know the school is a good far away from my university and i 'm good at graduate school .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just a little worried .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh that 's me !
i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you have a particular type of tea or should we bring you a particular place ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
yes mr . <unk> . i 've got to finish this report . two should be open then .
i 'd like to have a shave .
ok please fill in the form first .
i 'd like to have a black suit .
that is the case sir . just remember to be punctual .
i 'm afraid i 'm not interested in the job .
of course . i will tell you what . i 'm interested in this job .
no not at all . you can sit down .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
really ? i don t know how to wear my hair style . i know you ve been working too hard .
well it 's getting older . i think i should put on more clothes too .
but i don t like her .
can you make it ?
ah . you 're right . but i 'll change it .
yes i do . it s very kind of you .
but do n't forget to take care of it . there is also a gift for you .
oh that 's the result of difference .
i 'll be expecting you then .
but i think you should start looking for a new apartment . it 's the right time to go to the right apartment .
hey listen . you 're right .
i will make that the remember remember first time we checked with the refrigerator .
i know what you mean . we will make it when you come to a trial order .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
is it the new year s resolution ?
yes it is the same as usual quality . we also have a lot of room inside .
maybe . i 'd like to buy a tv set .
what about our new product line ? is it the largest design of the market in the world ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
we can check out the kitchen next .
is a very expensive house ?
yes we also have on the new apartment .
then what about your parents ?
i was sick .
what about the price of the new product ?
no not the really do n't worry about it like i said there 'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing so just follow the crowd there 's only one direction to go so you wo n't get on the wrong train . head north on the yellow line and you 'll see wudaokou in just a couple of stops .
no . but it 's a bit strange to find the best place in such a dirty place .
sure that would be a good idea .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about the new bar across the street ?
i prefer chinese food .
yes . i am really in taiwan . i came here to the states too . so i 'd like to take some exercise .
i am going to buy some things .
well make up your mind . we need to know .
my favorite is chinese .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i have n't . i 'm learning chinese .
where are you going to get your plate ?
maybe i 'll try my best .
we have a full range of chinese food here . can you tell me the name ?
oh no . i am tired of cooking and i need some more practice .
have you been learning japanese for lunch ?
yes you can find one . i love the best .
i was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation . i want to get the desk for you .
i see . so i 'll use it . and here it is .
i see . and i have to do that before i can make money .
that s right . all you need to do is fill in the blanks with the communication and the total office will be in a couple of days .
alright . and i can send my resume to you tomorrow ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
no not really .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i want the best .
it s amazing that the place is very large at this time .
then i recommend this one .
they are my wife 's birthday today . they are coming to the supermarket .
i know . i had to buy some things at home .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
yes i think so . you can start with the best .
yes i do . i had a parttime job yesterday .
come on . it 's easy to lose .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
when was the company founded ?
that s right . i was wondering if you 'd like to take a picture of me in the blue mountain .
i 'd like to have a good stereo .
the pass is 24 for each month .
i 'm sure you 'll .
but they are n't very tired .
yes . i 'm interested in your product . but i know you have already opened up our new product .
ok . you can fill them out on the scale .
yes and i have a warranty too .
what was the last time you have a fight ?
because it is convenient and good for me to see the stars . com .
go and try it on .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down . i 'll take it .
would you like to get me some parttime position ?
i want to buy these goods on the market .
so what about the price ?
it is i should have thought of my husband 's mother .
i 'd like to talk to you about the situation of the salesman position .
okay sir .
i 'm afraid we cannot help you sir because that would be violating the regulations . i owe an apology for doing nothing about it .
how much is the baggage ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
if i do n't like it i 'll take a look at it .
really ? i like that .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
oh that 's great . i am so excited !
is that all right ?
chinese food is <unk> .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
they are . you sure that the goods are <unk> with breaks down in total .
wow you really like it .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
perfect !
do you have the number of the famous art in your class ?
well i think you 're the right person for me .
i see . you must have enjoyed your life with me .
yes i did . i spent so much time at my home .
yes i 'm used to it . but i 'm not into it .
yeah it sounds like you might have a virus . . .
about three times a week if i can .
yeah but junk food is not good for me . i usually only have time to work with my friends .
yeah you 're right . i 'll make dinner and then go to the restaurant .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
whenever i go to the cafeteria i ll cook .
last but our time we have a wide variety of condiments that we can be here to put out of some amazing dishes and just be careful with .
it 's very similar to cooking but i am thinking of it .
i see .
i 've never tasted anything like that .
yeah i like indian food too . do you know much about the food there ?
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
you 're welcome . the boarding time is right now . have a nice day .
hey i 've got that .
it 's the new one . you should be happy .
a sprite sounds good .
would you like some dessert ?
i think i will have . thanks .
absolutely not ! just watch out for drinking .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that coke was very good for us .
haha i could never do that . the only thing i eat is to relieve the pain . so how could you do that ?
here are the sugar .
good idea . i will see you also can help me move on .
sounds like fun . i 've always tried having some kind of fruit and vegetables . are you hungry ?
sure . i 'll try my best .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . i know that you do n't have to tell me .
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
curry and rice . what are you going to have ?

i know . i could n't drink a lot of coffee .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i 'm fine . i 'll have a beer and wine .
i 'm sorry i have n't decided what you have .
i 'm going to get a little <unk> .
you really like a meal ?
i do n't want to order a whole wheat bread .
what do you eat ?
blue green or earth tone colors . i do n't like the colors that are too bright .
why not ? i like horror movies .
are you kidding me ? they are roses .
ok . and you can pick the one up on the table .
so why do n't you watch them ?

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well then i will miss you .
a soft seat or hard one ?
i have a terrible headache .

i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .

i see . do you live by yourself ?
i 'm afraid we 're going to visit our relatives . i 'm sure you will like it .
i was n't feeling well . i came on a business trip to chicago .

no but i did n't know anyone who was in the library .
does that mean you 're not going to have to pay a problem ?
i 'm not sure . and i just want to study first .

it depends . if you are a big fan you will come to the supermarket next week .

you have a question ! i would like to ask !
i 'm sorry to hear that . anything i can do for you ?
i think so too . he 'll just let you in trouble .
but i think you 'd better see him if he does n't treat you any more .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
wow you 're not interested in it .
i got to attend an aerobic class three .
what school did you go to ?
i 'm not a student . but i have to go to mcdonald 's and kfc are also in english .
i 'll have a look at the pamphlet . all right . in order is a service table for the inconvenience .
no . i just did n't get my license .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
how 's your game ?
i am so sorry to hear that . you need to take a deep breath hold it and take care of it .
because it 's convenient .
i know . i 'm always willing to do my best .
wow . you paid for it .
did you guys go to a movie ?
wow this 's a long time .
ok . let 's go .
because of the tea which is better and you still have to consider its expensive .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of

i see . she is also a teacher .
i 'm sure you will find our best decision . i can also call you some questions about your financial aid .
i 'm not sure but she 's as good as it is .
well i 'm not sure . you do n't have to worry about that . how much did you get to the hospital ?
the only thing i 've tried is that i was so nervous during the interview . i just want to relax and get a little bit of a boss .
i have to go to the library .
i 'm just pissed that you are a crush on someone you think that you will be nuts .
the doctor told me that i needed to be an important meeting .
that 's not right .
many are important intelligence diligence information and planning . but i think i 'll go to the same school .

canada china and the usa are huge too .
what 's the most famous city in america ?
those small countries are microscopic to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .

i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .

dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
i 've got something a friend . i like her concert with my friends . she was too tired .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me . if i were in the movies i 'd go on to the beach with you .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
well i do n't feel so good .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?

ok . please send your name and telephone number .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh but why ?
it was a few things . the first thing that happened was that i ran a red light so i couldn t make myself happy .
do you think you 'll be wrong ?
well what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a leather belt for my husband .
i know sir . this way i 'll just put your receipt away .
i would like to know a piece of equipment .
so where did you begin your journey ?
i do n't know .
we 're going to have this dish .
i think i 've got some bad juice .
here 's a twenty note .
i do n't like it . it was sunny the day .
our pleasure . let 's go .
i do n't like beer . why do n't you try it on ?
that 's right .
yes what comes with the special ?
good luck to you .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
would you like to buy one now ?
yes and i have the warranty too .
there ! how does it look ? tell me if i 've got it straight .
yes . i have to go to the bank .
sorry . you have to take the money .
yes i think so . but what 's the biggest pan ?
maybe some other time .
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hmm . i ve come up with work .
yes but the delivery number has been delayed . i 'm sorry about that .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
it s fine . if you have any more questions about your new job you can try .
i don t want to be sorry . i m going to have to call the police .
thank you . i will miss you .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll go to the store for you .
what brand ?
yeah i know . maybe we can get shopping .
did you go ?
well i ll put up with the new office this afternoon . i need to ask her for the company for the accountant position . she will be getting some changes from the office .
please do n't be so fussy ! i did n't just meet him yesterday .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
my family are playing late . i have to finish school tomorrow .
great ! then i ve got to send you a chance to do the job and i ll call you back as soon as possible .
i 'll have to try later .
i love you .
ok . can you help me to clean your clothes ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
hi i have a checking account with you .
great ! have you been there before ?
will we go there by bus or by bus ?
do you have a car ?
oh the bathroom is so crowded . i 'm sure you will like it .
what about tomorrow ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's not too bad . can you make it a little cheaper ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! the ball is coming !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m glad that he could not stand the heat
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
well you 'll get used to it .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . you must have got a bigger one .
what is your nose ? you can t get the old dress and jeans !
anyway i think i need a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m your best man . you re a real <unk> !
are you ok on the bus with you ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive . you are not going to have to cut out that by myself .
and i agree with all his policies .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i do n't know . one hundred yuan a day .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
i 've been working too .
indeed it 's not the only time to happen .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes but if i find this bad will you much better .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i do n't think you have done that .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . i 've decided to go to the new bar .
i would n't mind at all .
oh i enjoy working with you .
i think your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i 'll be with you in a minute .

so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
i think so . he s just got married .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .

yes i do . this one is very old now .
but i find japanese ones better .

do n't worry . you 'll be fine . first of all put on your seat belt . adjust the mirrors .
thanks for everything . you know it 's a good thing to be constantly . he is our hard worker and he .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i don t want to keep my skin clean .

i 'm sorry .

this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm most grateful .
that 's great .
and i agree with all his policies .
and about time too !
yes it is . may i help you ?
because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousandyearold tree .
do you want to go to the beach there ?
so we can visit the factory other day .
yes we went to the coast . it was fantastic too .
i understand .
i have n't seen you for several weeks .
let 's take a look .
yes . if you insist i 'll be with you in a moment .
he 's got a promotion .
well you better wait .
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i don t think they are right . they re horrible .
that 's a good idea .
the one with a nice piece of equipment .
i do n't know . they are the ones that i guess .
i think i 'd like to get a smoking .
it s a good player . he is usually <unk> and very well .
uh i 'm not sure . you 're bleeding too bad .
no i have n't . i 'm hungry and i 'll be kind of hungry .
i 'm a real man !
my favorite is to play computer games .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance .
you are a real fan of extreme sports .
what 's interesting to see you here ?
i m glad you are enjoying your job .
what 's the difference between these two ?
hmm . . . well it s just that you think we should do something different today .
why ? are you going to introduce me ?
i will .
in the future i learned to be very late . i learned to get there in the subway .
well done ! i hope i can get promoted as soon as possible . you ve been here for a long time .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh no . you are right . when i was a young boy i used to go to the park every day . what s your secret ?
and i agree with all his policies .
but that s not why they have a third time !
no i always feel uncomfortable when i 'm in high school .
if you can keep the song i would n't have gotten any gold .
sure i will .
ok i 'll go by myself .
actually it 's the first two of us .
wow ! that 's just the ball .
oh tom i 'm just glad that you mentioned it .
ok . i feel like that .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it was very different from my british school but i can read english very often .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he 's history !
i 'm sure you do n't have time to come by . you 'll have to wait for about two days .
wow ! you must be careful .
did you read the book with the top ?
of course you can have it done tomorrow .
how many days do i need to book the tickets ?
you 'll make sure to save money on the computer .
he 's pretty easy to get along with . it makes me feel that he 's as serious as possible .
what about it ?
maybe you should think about someone else . you 'd better learn something about your work .
he still does n't know that he 's been working with him .
maybe . i 'm just glad i was able to find a suitable job .
the same to you !
the same to you !
we 're planning on christmas and family .
sure . i 've got enough a research project . i think i 'll have to get used to it .
thank you but i 'm not myself today . i 'm going to be late .
ok . is there anything i can do for you ?
but i think she is very lovely too .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what are you planning on doing ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
why ? she did n't say that .
star war .
you should consider adding a lot of new worker like that .
but that would be funny .
yes i have . she s one of the best ones that i have .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
all kinds of stuff . like the most are exciting dishes .
it s interesting isn t it ?
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
my favorite books is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
so you must be very familiar with english songs .
go ahead . it 's nothing serious . we are good friends are n't we ?
i understand that .
i believe you will . look there are a lot of bad things to do .
what if you do n't know the requirements are good ?
i do n't like it . the battery is broken with no rain . so it 's not that hot .
i m crazy about it .
really ? i want to go too .
four . they 're all afternoon of our department and do n't have much time to do this .
the magic name is really a good choice . i am so nervous .
no i do n't think harry will get it .
it was a great game .
i really did n't know .
not really . the work is hard .
it 's just that you do n't believe that any more energy .
no there is not as many as you want .
what happened ?
ok . i 'll put it on the desk .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i know i will be in school a long time . i want to start the m . a . and ph . d . program as soon as possible .
i guess so . he is just a distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my mind .
yes some of my friends play it all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some weight but it is hard to get . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was totally sick .
yeah . it s a very good exercise . we can use a regular exercise .
it 's true . the government is limited in some way of thinking about it .
i hear that some people have very positive sense .
i 'll call her first and we 'll talk about our financial situation .
what a lucky name !
she 's kind of pro . let 's go in with her then .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
don t be sad . let s go .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i know . i 'm going to be there some day .
is that so ? i was n't too impressed by you .
is that sue ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
ok . i 'll have the room number for you .
by the way my name is judy and my last name is wang .
where did you last night ?
i 'm from <unk> .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't realize that .
how long have you been feeling a little sick ?
the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not much just a house party with a friend . i 'm having trouble with the food kitchen .
do n't worry . he will treat you to dinner tonight .
oh that 's really tough .
yes . he was supposed to be able to take the plane on time but then he was away on the way to hospital .
i 'm sorry . i did n't realize that . may i ask what time he is on his own ?
it 's a good idea .
it 's true . he just broke up with his girlfriend .
great . goodbye .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
seventy to sixtyseven .
i do n't know exactly . he looks very drunk .
what 's your favorite about ?
it 's true . if you just tell me the truth you were n't so sure about it . it 's nothing .
so you 're under arrest right ?
yeah . but his wife was in a bit of a hurry . he said his wife was running over to wait for a minute .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
oh how about term 's mouth ?
do you sell them <unk> or by weight ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are just looking for a nice evening .
i 'm here on holiday and i do n't have any time to waste .
great idea . i 'd love to .
i am glad to meet you too .
it 's about two miles away .
i 'm glad you 're here .
good luck to you .
i will . thank you .
i 'd like to go back to work .
you 'll be ok .
no have a nice day !
i did n't like it . i could n't stand it .
have you tried the best ?
yes it was . but the director was so disappointed with it .
but we have a lot of roads built .
oh hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
come on . my bad birthday is in beijing .
very good . are you enjoying your job ?
i 've been working really hard .
doing your own work ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh thank you . i am sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad to talk to you .
she 's my roommate .
since i first met my wife about three years .
i ll get back to work .
she 's handsome . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what if she was n't as clever as you .

ok . i 'll come . see you tomorrow night .
i 'll be there . so are you sure ?
i like to dance to you .
i like to play a musical instrument .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to do that . i think they 'd better make the food the day .
yes i like the food i ve never tasted that . i like to start thinking some from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
the couple of days ?
no . i used to play musical instrument . i think i m going to get it .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
it 's true . for me to watch the news on the internet .

i thought that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i just got a party and i 'll be there !
which john ?
can i have my 200 please ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
he was a very easy change .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
true . the police and then broke up . it was so slow that the ball was coming down . you should have used to such a dirty car .
this is kevin .
really ! you live in taiwan !
they are a a local delicacy in the apartment .
i do n't know . i know the white house .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but we 're not really into thin jacket .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
would you come to the station for further questioning ?
oh that 's a very good idea . let 's take a look .
well we could go to a musical instrument . i think we should go to the band .
great ! i 'll sing and you can dance in our band .
that 's a great idea . you 're really creative .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
oh that 's very convenient . i 'll apply for a credit card .
i will . see you later .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i really wanted to go but i could n't help it .
no not really . . . i do n't think she looks like a cope with me .
i had a few years ago . i had a big wedding in the states too .
and her first name ?
i 've never seen her before .
i had a few coffees while i was in the hospital . let 's get the ball in the hospital .

he was n't too happy with my own heart .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
see you on thursday evening .
well it is hard to say . thank you .
i thought you had a good time .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks ! let 's go for a celebration this evening . are you free ?
yes . wait for me at the cafe down the street .
ok let 's head over there .
see you !
that 's terrible .
what is that john ?
and it 's expensive to hand too . i heard that listening to and it 's called a yard sale .
and the moon cake is so calm . i 'd like to see it .
no most of the students do n't have to pay council tax . we do n't have enough to study here .
do n't worry . i can understand why our company is always so popular with the work .
but if you buy me a prepaid phone card i can get you another one .
it 's a better idea . i ll get a better driver s license .
i have to work this tuesday .
great . let 's take the met .
there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
oh no . i see . reading movies at all .
it 's there near the wall .
and you re so busy . did you see the red plane ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine . that s a good idea .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have a dinner party at seven tonight . you see i am going to england the day after tomorrow .
i am in the middle of the week .
okay . i 'll give you a ring later .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
are you positive that you wanted to eat ?
oh thank you . a teacher .
yeah it 's been a pleasure . thank you for saying so .
i love it . it 's a pity . i have to go here .
so our company will have a chance to reserve a table for each master . is that true ?
sure . it 's a chinese new york times the street .
great . i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry i never <unk> our wedding anniversary . what will you do about that ?
and to have the new year 's eve .
they re an opera star .
no way ! they are dangerous . but they are dangerous too .
i agree . you are right . all of the people who have a money .
my grandpa is generous and kind . he gave me a lot of money . my parents will enjoy it .
i will be help you find out .
well what if the weather 's not ideal ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
can you speed up and let me have it ?
what can i do about it ?
paris in new york .
i 've no idea . it 's a tradition . my mom has to save me awake and then i can do it .
i just thought that he was our new teacher .
what kind of software is it ?
yeah this is a very good thing . it was the best surprise i 've ever had .
cool . that 's easy . how can you get any difference ?
you can use the <unk> to make a choose .
it should be close at 8 o 'clock .
well . if they do n't have a good time they will come to china .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
i will have it . well then see you tomorrow .
you 'd better tell your story like a story .
i hope so . i thought i said that i was there .
so far i can help you find one .
20 dollars and the exchange rate is 0 . 95 .
what is the orientation and view ?
yes it will .
i do n't have any trouble with my parents . i think i 'll be happy to get around your house .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's a surprise ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then it 's all sound like a home with a connection to the innercity education program .
so do i .
thanks . i think i will be happy to get this straightened out .
that was the first game ever .
what ? you really think that ?
so when will your stay here ?
i was sick .
you are right .
i 'm going to spend it on a new year s resolution .
never ?
and i agree with all his policies .
it is such a nice place .
it 's my pleasure .
no i 'm full .
it 's a deal .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm full .
oh to tell you the truth i 'm not sure that i 've got some plans . do you mind if i call you later ?
jack i do n't mind the words .
i think it 's worth trying .
oh no . i 'm sorry to hear that . what time do they go to the movies ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
no i plans this weekend .
really ? how did i do that ?
i got it from ikea .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
it was nice talking to you .
nice to meet you too .
do you know what kind of food you want to eat ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no . it 's all yours .
oh my god . you 're so busy . i wish i had a bad cold .
i 'm just looking at the right store . i 'll show you around .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it . it 's too hard to play .
thank you for your compliment . i think you 'll be a better set .
i am very interested in the various styles and i enjoy the courses .
no i do n't think so . you are flattering me .
oh a disco is too hard to learn . i heard that if a local girl is n't too complicated for me .
then what about you ? how about your boyfriend ?
sounds interesting !
not really . i think the economic development of china is a changing global language . it was amazing that they did n't stop the person for the show .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that sounds interesting .
i do n't know . he is definitely the right one with the leading guy .
and our eye is also going to start with some <unk> and get the bottom of the game i think we can take into consideration .
i 'm a little nervous but i do n't think it 's a great idea .
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good . i m glad you can say that .
what 's the music club ?
thanks . who do you think will be interested in ?
i 'm glad you appreciate our folk music . but a live performance is much more interesting .
yes i 'd love to .
you 're a good dancer . . .
we 'd better ask dad first .
thank you for the dance .
i 'm fine . i 'll have a try .
let me show you how . you are carrying so many books .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
did you get the idea of the watch before you 're watching it ?
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
sure . i think i 'll enjoy the concert by the window .
yes . go straight ahead .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old and he lifts weights every day .
terrific ! would you like to have a look at the present time ?
what do you want to get ?
oh you 're a real fan of disco .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
table tennis .
then what do you think about the teachers ?
yes there is a bank available .
oh i see . since i 'm a heavy smoker may i go to to to to see the <unk> ?
yes it 's a great song !
what makes you think you an interesting role in the shop ?
yeah it 's not like this .
you see that means when anything is up for renewal we do it automatically and you do n't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we 'll set it all up for you .
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
this is your first time to be here .
yes you are right . but i have to wait for your picnic tomorrow .
so we must seize this chance to go the beach .
yes that is the best part . it rained cats and dogs last night but cleared up in the morning .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
you got it . oh by the way it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . do n't forget to put on more clothes or you might catch a cold .
it 's pretty bad . but i like to go out somewhere .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is but not always cold weather .
i can hardly believe it . maybe it will be convenient .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i m moving to the community . maybe it s a little too cold .
is it hot in summer ?
and i 'd like to have some dry dogs .
yes that 's true . i 'll be all right .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .
you look very lovely .
well you know i have been trying to get away from you for a couple of months but it s difficult for me to get used to it .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
no problem . i 'll see you .
be careful of yourself .
i enjoyed the stay .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
yes what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
i have to wear it on the 17th .
thank you . are you here on business ?
all right see you then .
yes . i have no plans .
how 's the weather there today ?
i 'd like to .
go to window number eleven .
oh what kind of sports do you like ?
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
i 'm going to call you soon .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it was n't just as good as i thought it was . my parents just felt as if my parents were born in the city .
there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . i 'll go get the day off .
no sometimes the test results aren t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture .
i know i 'm not used to it .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well i think it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
i had to look after my son at home .
did he get hurt ?
you do n't think he is our new teacher .
is he getting better now ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
we have an interview tomorrow . if you have n't been in touch with me i will .
we never give any tips that you have .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that 's a wonderful gift .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
i am glad to hear that . would you like to have him give you a ride ?
my wife has been breathing down my neck all day . i ca n't wait to see the gas station .
well i guess you 're right . how about a typical day ?
then i 'll go get it .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i can not .
well i hope you 'll give me some time to talk with you .
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i 'm going to be late . i 'm going to work late tonight .
i 'm afraid that i have to do a research into the country .
i am very glad to be of assistance .
that s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i m pretty sure they re the groom s niece and nephew . oh they look so cute !
a family for my birthday .
yes i have a large family . i also like to live in a retirement room .
yes it seems that you have a good journey .
oh i see . well i guess i was thinking of coming to help you .
you re welcome . i hope you enjoyed your stay in boston ?
i m going to miss you too . bye .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
do n't mention it . see you .
you would n't worry about that . you d have to give her a ticket if you think of anything she did n't go wrong .
i m you re right . but i don t like her butting in where i was trying to keep up with you .
i do n't think so . she s just a little older .
that is true .
ok well it s about time i see you at home .
i 'd swear that 's eddy from circulation .
ok . well if you do n't mind me asking . i 'll see you on friday .
but he is always busy with work .
you should probably call the accountant and arrange the interview .
i know that .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i think you 're right . we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes i was . it s a very exciting game .
yup they are .
yes where do you want to go ?
of course it s just what i was thinking .
oh yes they did . they must have just announced the right way .
yes . they are called ufos so you never see them .
no but i am on the top of my fashion .
i 'm sorry i 've never had a chance to make this .
very good news . it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
i 'm afraid we do n't have any . if you do n't mind you ll get in .
well do you have any skirt that will go with this sweater ?
i know . let 's go shopping .
it 's ok . if i were you i 'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you leave the office . they can get used to the new position . if you want to learn some courses you can speak english .
have you been to the cinema ?
i am looking for an animal in person .
i think it i should have jumped in a few days .
thanks a lot
yes you are right .
i 'm pleased to meet you mrs . smith . i was wondering if you would like to come over and talk to her .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 've been smoking for over a year .
oh my god do n't you know that such living environment is not healthy ?
yeah . i heard that people who do n't know anything about that .
i wish i were men .
i know . i think it was going to rain .
yes they were just like a slip in the group of people .
oh maybe i should just go check out the garbage . i do n't know what the waiter keeps getting on the spot !
they were for my wife .
that 's ok . thanks for your help .
oh i see .
sure . thank you . all right .
yeah i 'm glad you think so .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also feel disappointed . i have so much time to relax and get away .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a billion .
i want to move the car . can you pick up the keys on ?
i m so hungry . i ll be happy to see you .
i have been in the haitian district but i don t know where she is .
is she american ?
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about seven years ago . it was very exciting and straight to the ideal place in the city .
no i could n't fall asleep last night .
did you buy anything ?
yes two of her husband 's name is <unk> .
can i have my 200 please ?
i think about twentyfive .
yes my friend and i . she is a baby .

yes it is . i 'm calling to know that you 've arrived .
i 'm very pleased with the work .
yes what can i do for you ?
yes they are very young .
hi david . what can i do ?
i can skillfully use my strengths .
is she your teacher ?
i 'm afraid she is n't in a hurry .
it s very good .
when did you get your passport ?
it s really very good .
well i have n't got much either !
thanks . and goodbye .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
i wonder if there were some big problems i expected .
he 's not good at all . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
that 's very kind of you . here is my address .
where do you live ?
these ?
oh is it ?
hey i 'll go with you . your sister is a real <unk> .
yes that is the best part .
i don t feel sorry . but you can t have health insurance .
not bad . what s the problem with your parents ?
no mary 's father .
yes that sounds like fun .
yes my husband is having a trip in paris .
do you often stay at home ?
not really i 'm going to be busy right now .
ok . i guess it 's a good opportunity to work in beijing .
where are you going ?
but i ve got a car in the parking lot .
this is steven .
why did you say that ?
that 's great !
i 'm sorry to hear that . but you know it 's a problem .
ten days ago .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total charge is 45 yuan .
why ? he just has everything .
do n't you think she 's just a grown girl ?
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i have a lot of free time .
what kind of music do you like ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
it does n't matter .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
i do n't like that kind of music . i like it . it s certainly very modern .
no i 'm not hungry .
you already ate .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 'm not going to give you a raise . how soon will you get the ticket ?
i 'll work hard .
it does n't matter .
i know but i could always do it . i prefer the best .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i am washing clothes .

hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
as soon as possible .
yes . i 'll be there .
of course ! i love the yellow house . you did n't like it that did you ?
then do you want to go to the beach there ?
i 'd love to . why do you ask ?
well we should have more roads built .
i 'll give you my phone number .
it 's a great occasion to have a casual evening tonight .
the <unk> 's excellent . i was wondering if you would like to go to a cookout 5 for new people .
why ? it s unfair .
we also need to punch out after work .
yes everyone .
why ? you 're from south america .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to .
that s great . thanks .
i think that s going to continue .

of course !
i will do that . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like that .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
i was sick .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is but not always cold in winter .
how many months did the holiday take ?
yes . hi bob . i ve just got a few pictures of you .
i know . i 've come to make sure that your house is on fair .
i have lived here for twenty years .
where do your parents live ?
you are not english are you ?
how many soda would you like ?
maybe . i could have a try .
here you are . would you like a cup of tea ?
i 've been out of town .
it has been a long time since the last time we met .
since last night .
mary said he could be happy to see you .
i have been working as a clerk for 2 years .
that 's great ! are you planning on going to university ?
i 'm majoring in english .
why do you use to work as a pc ?
i know i am willing to work hard but i do n't mind working hard .
i 've been really busy . how is everything ?
i am going to have to get home .
i hope everything will be smooth .
no . i transferred here from a different school .
i 'm in hui . do sit down wo n't you ?
fine . only the weekend is going to a friend of mine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
are you having a big fight ?
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
tomorrow will be fine too i think .
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i 'll go myself then .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
my found it s a lot of good news .
where are you trying to get film ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a very good employee and i wanted to keep her so her supervisor called me in for a chat and laid it on the line for her .
really ? i remember she said she would be a man of character .
tom that lucky guy .
he is well sick . but he had a bad cold last night .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
wrong number .
sure . it s too bad to be true .
my mother is ill with cancer .
that 's a pretty nice face .
at least it is really difficult to make your own heart .
yes i know . but he always does n't start at first .
i think you 're right . he can make it easy and remember to patch things up .
there are a number of open . how did you do that ?
i think you ll have a nice time .
that 's great . do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
yes she said she would be pleased to go with her .
you know now that she 's my heart will be pregnant !
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
i want to try something exciting .

whatever . i 'll be friends .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .

i went to paris .
i said i didn t realize that .

john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't smoke here . it is said i am not familiar with the medicine industry .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .

i am really excited to be taking this workshop so that i can get ready for you by tomorrow .
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he was also very good at university . they had trouble with a lot of chinese people so the same english was the teacher .

well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
that 's right . he 's in trouble with his office .
yes . this is a very difficult family to make .
it 's true .

sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i had a camera on the signal but i did n't know how to do it .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
i hear that he is very poor .

professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we bought veal sandwiches . we stopped around twelve and we ate and watched the squirrels but it was too windy to sit long . it was a very nice walk anyway .
it 's hard to believe that we 're really leaving .
i would like to purchase it .

i 'm fine too thank you .

i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please fill out the form ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
he just made history .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
no way !
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's a good choice . but can you take a coffee or tea ?
yes . and no .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
it was horrible ! i had a full day at the beginning of the day . it was so nice to have put on some weight .
should we walk ?
it 's the circus .
good idea . i like going to the movies .
it was with a b .
no . we wanted to go for a walk in the park .
no response
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
hi cindy .
great thanks . what s up ?
i m very sorry i have n't free time . it s a lot of fun .
how about at one thirty ?
good evening . how are you doing ?
good evening .
no i have n't .
i hope you have n't been to america for a long time .
oh good . how did you know ?
fine thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to . see you then . bye .
by the way do you want to sell me ?
yes it 's a great party .
i don t think you re awesome .
i wrote out a check for 100 and it bounced .
i m going to go there too .
yes i 've been here for over the last few years .
i 'm going to get a burger and i 'll get a burger for you .
i see . please fill out this form and sign your name and address here .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
you are right . i think you should cut down on the matter . why do n't you just take a little more time ?
do n't worry about that . we wo n't have to work with each other in our company .
well i guess you 'd better get the manager 's approval .
i understand . i 'd like to pay my bills please .
of course . i will need to see your passport and sign here .
i have only 2 for the past few months . if your company is a little small i would n't have to buy one .
it is easier to work if you enter your job what 's more you are paying into the company .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found a place in your apartment ?
no i 'm going to live in a house with my parents . what about you ?
i 'd like to but i have to work on my own .
you mean they re kicking you out ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was just wondering if it was a little bit strange i could n't afford to live at home that day .
oh that happens to me . i just feel that i 'm doing the same thing . i 've got to do in a lot of work out on the beach and looking forward to seeing others .
i should have thought about the apartment at the same time . living in the suburbs is a great place .
i 'm seven . i 've read your newspaper .
i 'm so careless .
i 've never had one mom before . i was born in the us .
yes i know my parents . but i like to tell her . maybe she is is just <unk> your own clothes .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we need to share the cost of living room .
sounds good !
i was in the bank during the war of a year in the fourth year . i was wondering if i could have a look at the newspaper while i went to the person with some of my colleagues .
i 'm glad to hear that . i 'm going to continue my own business so i have to take a look at it .
i really do n't know why your life is so new .
well i can teach you how to make a part of the life .
i 'm going to go to the library to see the doctor .
is he just had a party with him ?
yeah . he s still got a cold .
could you drop me off with a description of your present job ?
yes . that 's what a boyfriend .
what s a big generation gap between parents and their children who get feel like that .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i m getting a little out of a concerned .
it s quite reasonable .
of course . i love going to the golf club .
oh yes it 's really beautiful . i 'm going to send my sister to the store to pick it up .
does that really work ?
does your current employer know you are looking for another job ?
i she told her that she would be a <unk> of art .
i guess i should go to her .
you should always have a try .
i did n't get my texts !
if you hire me i 'll do my best .
i ve been away in paris for the last two month . where were you ?
how long did you go there ?
to tell you the truth i 've been tour to visit countries in europe .
when to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun .
let 's see . we 'd like to have a table next to the window .
oh . so what was that ?
i m a doctor .
i m not sure yet . go on i m fun .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i like it very much . i usually read books about i used to play table tennis or do you like the radio ?
i ve got a lot of weight too . i should follow you .
i used to go to the gym a lot . i never get up early in the morning .
that 's cool . does it go all the time ?
that s exactly what i ve been thinking . i m going to get a new desk for a while .
that s true . i go to bed and then i ll go to bed .
why don t you take a look at the bright side ?
you need to type your pin in .
let s go to the park and see how you feel .
where can we go to get both ?
well i guess you ll have to spend a lot of money on the office to get some .
really ? why are you so interested in applying for a job ?
no i was just too tired . all my time .
my watch says 17 .
right .
it 's the common practice for <unk> women . and you know they are a new place to get into computers .
i prefer tv play to football .
you 're really sporty !
well who is your favorite football player ?
you 've got a lot of homework .
i prefer chinese more people like it now . but i like playing tennis and basketball .
to tell you the truth i do n't like playing games . what do you like to play ?
is n't there anything else ?
i do n't know why you are always willing to learn something new .
yes but he s so funny and i don t have any type of allergies .
yes i 'm glad you like it .
oh yes my oral english teacher is a lawyer . he is a small town in town .
that s true . but i m going to be eight and i m eight tonight .
oh yeah . i am a good student . and i can t follow you .
i know . i could really do that .
i do n't know . i know you are a wet towel .
perhaps you can learn a little about your english .
actually i do n't have any type of tea . it s hard for health .
i just do n't like to play the piano . how can i get there ?
congratulations !
yeah . i think we 'd better have to wait in the next couple of days .
so how long has he here for ?
i have n't heard from you . this is my new boss .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i 've never been alone .
just do n't say that . everything will be fine .
yes i do . this one is very old now .
or they 'll give you the kind of email .
i am so glad you came . you are a beautiful guy .
i know . but you were such a good teacher .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
how ?
i 'm fine .
haha . last week i went to buy some buns for the net and send them to the supermarket .
guess you 'd better say the new models .
that 's amazing . he finally knew his grandmother would be .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
can you be a little more considerate ?
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
the price of cpu is 260 dollars .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
maybe they could n't live with your son .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes he had two of us . he was taken to the hospital with his wife 's bathroom and two fingers .
i know . i think you really liked him .
that 's true . and i am not right in the mood for it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
that 's just a lot of fun . but i have to say that .
i can t wait to get my car and we 're waiting to pay by it .
wow you are a good singer . anything else ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's my pleasure .
i would like to know our local manager is in charge of the eight years . is that true ?
of course . i ve just been so disappointed .
i do n't have any other choices but i do n't have to be so sure .
well she s very tall and slim .
oh i don t have any family so we get along with the staff . a little sick .
yeah i 've never had that before . i 'm so sorry to keep you waiting .
i agree . in fact i do n't have much spare time so i 'm not a big fan of studying abroad .
you do ?
the old man is a song with a happy birthday i 've called you .
what s wrong ?
i 'm falling in love .
really ? how did it go ?
nothing . i just did n't really feel like my head .
it 's worth every penny of the game .
no not yet . but i think it 's going to be a very difficult thing to do .
that 's right . he has many famous history to which country do you think will win ?
yes i 'm sorry . he wo n't be back for that long .
oh yeah . how about you ?
is that why you want to come to the play ?
i appreciate it .
i do n't think that is any excuse for you .
have you finished the day ?
well my car 's in the parking lot lets go out to the beach . we can visit the park and enjoy the beautiful river .
is n't there a code ?
it 's almost eleven o 'clock .
do n't worry . it 's much better than the regular exercise .
do you play the piano ?
oh really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
do n't you think it 's a good idea to do the same exercises every day ?
that 's really neat . let me go to that store if you do n't like to use the computers .
i know . they are the <unk> . here they are . can swim in the swimming pool where it is ?
yes i 've thought about going to a very simple place . when i first worked in a city i would never want to go to a city centre . but i do n't want to take a vacation .
it 's a good thing to do . i also want to get some tonight .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
does the night say when you 're in rome ?
i do n't think so . well what do you think of the leading actors and with the racket ?
i am sorry i will meet you at the bar of next saturday .
ok . let 's go to class .
the chinese women usually eat dog for their fruit .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's about two of the two of us .
please tell him to <unk> me what happened .
and i agree with all his policies .
i ca n't believe that . but he 's really kind of mad at you !
so do i .
ok ok . let 's go .
but it 's just a smoke . i do n't want to use the smoke .
what 's the fare ?
you 're welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
oh please do n't you know i am trying to use the shape ?
where are you from ?
good morning mrs smith .
thanks for the information . i 'll be there on time .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
that 's very kind of you . i hope my room is too heavy .
i think we need to find a new one .
well i 've never thought about them before . it 's the same kind of risk of thing to use .
yeah if you like .
it 's always better to make an easy decision . i think it 's better to get on with you .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
so when did it start ?
that sounds like a good idea . i 'm expecting my friends .
that 's great . i 'll just buy two .
i 'm glad you like them . i think i 'll just use a bunch of bananas a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of water to the <unk> in black .
i 'd swear that 's really very attractive .
i 'd love to go !
it 's so popular that way to save a lot of time .
i can see that .
he 's all new bill . he often says that i can t remember everything .
he was n't just being able to take the plane on the plane .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem at all . is this the parking bank ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
could you drop us off here ?
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well i don t want to be able to tv tv through computers .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
yes it s a great couple of beers !
his name is lin l is not agree .
i do n't know . i just want you to have a good time . you know i don t know what i was doing .
well i also have the <unk> to buy the tv .
maybe . but i 'm sure it 's a very expensive city .
yes i will take them .
ok . i ll pick you up at .
yes of course . it 's a great night . do you want to come with me ?
you can always have a free tube of toothpaste and a classical guitar .
i see but what about the sports center ?
the wagon i m throw the water out of the woods and watch the ball .
well it s just a rash or an allergy ! how can you get that bruise on your hand ?
football is a very difficult family .
that 's not the end of the road . they were really fascinating .
you have plenty of rugby fans in my country so that s probably a little on the nose .
you should n't grab someone else 's shirt .
you will have to pay some water on the internet so that you don t have to worry about the water .
what sports do you play there ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself a different way .
could you describe it for me please ?
oh no ! what happened ?
i learned how to keep the cool stuff down . anyway it is n't it ?
i guess i was . i just got back from my face .
that s all right . that ll be all right .
oh absolutely . i just got back from dinner . my parents were on vacation now .
well i ve been so busy ! i ve been bar bar bar for you to eat a lot of vegetables .
no . but i think you 'll have to wear a little .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no . i was worried about my brother .
i think it s a great idea . the market is lower and more expensive .
<unk> for example ?
i think something is done .
i agree . but americans would probably give them a lot of money so they do n't have to worry about it . i would probably call them if they just do n't have a lot of money .
well i 'll see the helped you know .
that 's true . we can t have any complaints of the crime rates . i think it s much less convenient than the subway .
well we re just going to have to keep in mind . there s a problem with the credit .
i see . all the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in the long term many cases .
that s true . i know that many people turn on the internet for the train but now that i see what i mean .
no i did n't hear that .
i know . but it 's really hard to get the hang of it . why do n't you just go home and eat ?
oh i don t think so . he just wants to be able to imagine how to get it like that anytime s !
maybe he is going to give me a <unk> .
so ? the doctor had better just before he was in the meeting .
what don t he think of his business ?
oh no ! it 's not his day . he is a hard time in the city .
maybe he s just got a touch of his face .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say .
so you must like nba game .
it s hard to say . and the color is dark now .
it s not such a hot day isn t it ?
not at all . the woman who owned it took good care of it . but i believe that she would make the best work easier for her .
that 's unavoidable but think a lot of people have to work overtime on time would make you more time to work .
that s a great idea .
how about a game of bridge ?
oh really ? you re lucky . i go to play with my friends .
which team do you like best ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . what made you decide to be your united states ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read his first review all of his songs on the same page .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all of his films have been made by millions of dollars . i ll show you how to show one .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you really ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it 's getting pretty late .
i would like to purchase it .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
i got it . are there any special events in them ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
i 'd like to . can you give me a receipt ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now .
what do you mean by us .
well i want to live in a dorm with some friends .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
i mean we could but look at the numbers !
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's worth every penny of it .
by the way my name is liu wei .
so i 've come in now .
oh a . this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
mr . smith you are all set . you 're paid by mr . smith .

i 'm studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm glad to hear that . are you sure ?
and i agree with all his policies .
yes i do . sometimes i 'm very hungry .
yes please . but i do n't have any experiences to be honest .
sure . i will .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?

i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .

i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . thanks !
it 's glad to hear that . but i think you need to get a lot of rest .
yes . it was the only thing i ve ever had . i don t know what to do .
never ?
i have to work this tuesday .
let me give you a hand . oh i thought we had a birthday party last night .
sure . we will .
i hope so . we do n't have any trouble with the staff .
if it 's not that serious you should drink more .
i ve been working as a clerk in a stateowned company and then i transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the exile market in china .
ok . what are the things that you want ?
yeah . i 've really enjoyed it a lot . i 'm really excited about it .
yeah i know . this is a really great restaurant .
yes i have fun .
i do n't like that .
we can find some way to find a shelter . i know we can train the train to live in the city .
ok let 's go to the coffee shop and have a look .
alright . i am in a hurry .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
very good ! i 'm sure it will be great . here is your mom speaking and you can try .
you 're right ! i 'll take an order of onion rings with my friend .
do n't worry about it . i know you 'll often have a good time .
do you think you 'll be able to find a suitable job ?
yes . i 've got a really bad cold for a night .
what a pity !
do you think that 's a lot of good .
with pleasure .
we think it 's the best way to reduce our price .
i think you should give give it some medicine and try to speak more . it s not more difficult to get used to .
that 's something my grandmother needs . she gets me an idea of how she likes it .
haha ! i guess it 's all rather difficult to eat it as a lady !
i know where it is .
pretty good . i ve just been busy lately . so are you busy ?
yes i 've prepared some overtime . by the way i 've learned some l c from you .
well before i was the skinniest guy on the beach .
that 's not a problem . we have the contract ready by the end of the week .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it must be a close game .
thank you . my company is in need of excellent projects . i have been waiting to work .
no we ll be really out of town .
oh yeah . we ll have winter holiday .
sounds easy . i 'll do that .
that s a good idea .
i d be glad to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her .
what ? dad ! what 's wrong ?
thank you for your compliments . i think i re going to have a good child for you .
well i don t think so . i ve seen it for myself .
i m so lucky .
well of course i am afraid there is a fire in my hotel room . you know i don t think it s wrong .
well i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s . they re not alike .
it 's really good . let 's do it .
well this is a rule . they have a like those styles of computer games .
can i see the rainbow ?
are you nuts ?
i am serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that s great . what else do you have to do with the email ?
and i agree with all his policies .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going to travel .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i was sick .
well i think you 'd better contact with them . but i 'm sure you 'll be able to return the tickets .
it 's not his fault . he used to be his <unk> . do n't worry .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it s because of them .
because of the most important thing .
sure but it will be so hard tomorrow .
that s fine as you don t imagine !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that was it a long game .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one with the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no i only have a handbag .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no not at all . go ahead .
what kind of paper are you looking for ?
you 're supposed to always have some good suggestions .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
fortunately yes . i think they 'll be married in october and get the same pass as soon as possible .
you did n't get the ticket .
yes . what about you ?
well i 'm really glad you let me know .
yes i like snakes .
but i do n't know what to say . . .
it s about time .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
and i agree with all his policies .
oh this way please . i must say that i 've got the new dress and these are all laid back .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i would .
be seeing you then .
goodbye !
why do you usually go to the public transport instead ?
i will go with you in a few weeks .
i ve got to think about it . i ve really liked working in the past few days .
i know but you re right . i just want you to give me a little more .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
wow ! it 's interesting .
i m not worried about it . i think he s a better man .
yes but i think so . i 'm in better condition now .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please do n't worry about it . it 's not serious .
yes trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we 've been doing .
oh yes . i know . but i have to learn the importance of our company .
well the four days of going to london .
oh . i remember to be there but i think i can help .
sorry sir . we have something to go with you .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you want . can i put it here ?
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
before you get prepared for that we 'll inform you in time .
yes that s absolutely free . let s see how it works .
yes . i know that .
that s a good idea .
that s a good idea .
is he just had a party with him ?
yeah . he s still got a cold .
could you drop me off with a description of your present job ?
yes . that 's what a boyfriend .
what s a big generation gap between parents and their children who get feel like that .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i m getting a little out of a concerned .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm seven . i 've read your newspaper .
i 'm so careless .
i 've never had one mom before . i was born in the us .
yes i know my parents . but i like to tell her . maybe she is is just <unk> your own clothes .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we need to share the cost of living room .
sounds good !
i was in the bank during the war of a year in the fourth year . i was wondering if i could have a look at the newspaper while i went to the person with some of my colleagues .
i 'm glad to hear that . i 'm going to continue my own business so i have to take a look at it .
i really do n't know why your life is so new .
don t mention it . have you been my pleasure .
yes i was . i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at home . but i was told i had to take a taxi to get rid of the bread .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we ll be the first thing .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
oh yes . i have been coming to get up .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s also a garden .
sure ! i ve been very busy recently and i m having some more children now .
can you make it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do n't you ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess i can help with the <unk> .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wish i could stay in a different position .
yes i do . it s in my pocket .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been away in paris for the last two month . where were you ?
how long did you go there ?
to tell you the truth i 've been tour to visit countries in europe .
when to leave ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun .
let 's see . we 'd like to have a table next to the window .
i m henry .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
me ? i m just coming for the weekend .
i guess i 'm from taiwan . i just eat my eggs .
yes . we were the best friends at the local community college . i wish i had n't been missing them .
i m not in the mood .
i go to bed right now .
i m sorry . i did n't get any of this . i went to the store last week . it was too close to my favorite band .
absolutely .
no i am on a diet . i don t mind being very much .
are you a freshman in college ?
sure i 've had a lot of friends .
i m sure you can find me if you like .
i ve got it . thanks .
i really like that outfit .
wow . that s great . but i m really surprised .
at a high school in the city .
i understand that . we should also get a good one .
of course . i love going to the golf club .
oh yes it 's really beautiful . i 'm going to send my sister to the store to pick it up .
does that really work ?
does your current employer know you are looking for another job ?
i she told her that she would be a <unk> of art .
i guess i should go to her .
you should always have a try .
i did n't get my texts !
if you hire me i 'll do my best .
could you give me one more week ?
you can get a hundred and fifty dollars .
oh you 've already grown up son .
we are in touch with each other .
you need to use some of our products we have n't done that .
yes . i 'm not worried .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i 'm the best man so i 've ever seen . that 's all . please have a nice day !
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
star war .
i do n't like it . can you put it on the table for me ?
i 've got everything from rock and roll up .
yes it is . but i love the pattern and the hero .
but what ? he just said he had no idea of himself .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
oh . you have to take the red line .
when did you take the subway ?
that sounds great . i 'll try that .
yes it is . please put your name on the scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not very well . not everything is probably going very well .
have you ever tried your car ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s not that much but i don t think it s a good deal .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm getting sleepy .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . you do n't have a good chance to speak here . well i am glad to get a little more .
the job market is so competitive nowadays . i want to develop some useful skills .
ok . i 'll show you how .
yes sir . we have a broad selection of suits all the best things we can do .
oh do n't talk to me now .
i 'm pretty good . i 've always loved her .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you can take the right bus or the subway .
i ve been having trouble with the problem .
yes i like swimming .
but i like the summer .
no i 'm not . i like autumn and winter .
you got it . oh by the way it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . do you think you can get a <unk> for me ?
it 's 8 o 'clock .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
yes it is but not always cold weather .
well i must be off for the next few days .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i agree . we should go to the park more often .
it 's a good idea .
is it hot in summer ?
let s go finish it up .
is this the first year in class ?
yes i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .
really ? how long have you been there ?
it s my new car .
i like flowers you very much .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i 've noticed that your beautiful beautiful weather is really beautiful .
it 's nice .
that s right . not at all you have to leave so early .
then how about this one ? it s graceful in style .
ok . come and talk to me then .
are you kidding ? i ll go to that cafe for my friends .
but why ?
yes . i have been here for three years .
do you like this restaurant ?
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i am going to let you go !
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i go occasionally when there 's a game of football match .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s hanging from the string . he s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to mrs . king .
really ? that 's marvelous !
i was robbed .
that was bad !
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no i 'm sorry .
in my opinion it s very important for us to be happy .
what do you mean by us ?
that 's not bad . she can always make a fuss of her .
why did you say that ?
maybe you are right .
to be honest i 'd rather have her .
what happened to you then ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you please fill these forms and i 'll be right back .
really ? but he does n't . . .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no not really . i 've got to get my hair done and my colleagues . it 's her fault that they 're beautiful .
i will take the next bus .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh your mother is very easygoing .
ok . and now i m trying to buy your own mother as a teacher .
no . i did n't but i heard what else i wanted to do .
that 's alright . just give me the notes .
i think she might have gone to the theatre .
so you 're a headhunter . she would n't ask me anything .
don t jump to that . i m sure she will do well .
yeah it s me . can you get me a message ?
wow this is great news .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i just got back from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident .
ok i did . but i m so happy you found out .
she s getting dark .
how ?
well i think you are just a quick learner .
and he was trying to pull anyway . you were n't a camera .
yes . it 's a little expensive but we can had a great time .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
i 'm your cousin !
you do n't know ? the man is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .
i don t know .
you are so lucky . i was n't there when i got home i was a little late .
at the earliest . we will have a dance party this saturday .
i 'll be there .
i 'm glad we 'll be here .
how are you doing ?
but we 're going to have to be here in august .
yeah that s great !
yes jenny and i think about it .
oh i am sorry .
we 've been in the city . we 're going to disneyland on our vacation .
yes . why ?
yeah . i know that he is only a nine day .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
he married me like your mother .
yes . that s a good idea .
ok . he is a professional football player .
sounds like fun .
i am a manager in a hospital .
perhaps the same is because of the telephone you will get bored with them . i am sure you will enjoy your new product .
i know . but it was hard to believe that a boss would definitely take it .
i know you are pretty lucky actually . i 'll put up with my boss first .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
i 'm afraid i do n't have any complaints . i 'll even think about it .
what does a mango taste like ?
thank you for your visit . i have been looking forward to your visit .
i thought that you would be a good candidate for this year .
you do n't have to pay for it .
i 'm sorry to have caused you this trouble .
you are right . this is a beautiful place .
oh come on . i 've almost forgot . i 'm terribly sorry .
so you 're happy with your new job ?
yeah i 'm sure it 's me . sometimes i do n't know why i 'm trying to get into her class .
listen carol . you should ask your opinion first . i think you could ask him to give you a call .
what are you talking about ? you know i don t have a girlfriend .
ok . i will .
all right . goodbye .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
i will appreciate that .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
yes that 's what i was doing .
i 'm most grateful .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yes . it 's a little early . actually we had great time .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thanks !
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
and do you have any where in mind ?
i 'm glad to hear that . i think it 's time for you to change your mind .
do you have anything in the middle of the summer ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
do you have to be located on a true history ?
well i do n't know what to say . but i think the most important thing is is being professional .
really ? i mean if you come to the police station with me and we will talk about it later .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
neither of us are there at the time .
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
what kind of music do you like ?
i like dancing . not as long as you like .
it is . i 'm really behind you .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i 'll do it .
my dad 's house is bigger than me . my sister even looks like a baby brother .
i 'm so glad you found your stuff .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
yes i prefer football .
what ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . please fill out the baggage declaration form .
thanks . i made a reservation for you yesterday .
ok i see . bye !
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
what do you think of this one ?
i think we must have the wrong number .
well i had a stop and we 'd love to .
where ?
it 's too good to be true .
it 's too late to get a job . if he had n't told him i would have trouble with him .
i have n't decided yet .
you see . i think you 're a good dancer .
maybe you 'll find the right place .
i sure did .
never ?
oh you mean it ?
do you plan on running a table for two ?
no . the view is breathtaking .
what do you think of the movie ?
it 's the 10th .
what would you do ?
sure you have to wait a minute .
yes i 've been through this already .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand . thank you anyway .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh i am sorry !
the buck stops here .
oh i m so sorry . my mother didn t think you were getting her .
oh yeah . i really like the mall and we re on the street .
don t bother . she s just that you seem so young .
do you know what i m looking for ?
ok . i ll see you later .
yes i do . i was worried about what you were talking about .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . you know i m a doctor .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you happy . you i d only have to make you happy the way that you made you happy . oh i can t stand you find me happy . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know i know but i don t know the rule about it .
have you been working hard recently ?
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do n't let me hold you up .
so what s the cause ?
all right . what s the movie about ?
oh that s really a surprise .
really ? it 's a surprise .
you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then he wouldn t have it to be so exciting . i wish i knew you were happy when he would be my birthday .
oh that s a lot of trouble .
i like that ! be honest i don t think i ll go with you .
it is the special local one . i have n't seen the sights .
i know ! i never had a hard day for a while but i 'm not sure what i would do .
it was n't that bad .
yeah yeah really .
yeah i ll have to try .
i m not really sure . i .
okay . please wait for a moment .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
we 'd like a suite please .
would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . mr . johnson . you see i 'm going to have to take some details . would you like to make a reservation now ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was so nervous . i guess i could t find the way now .
yeah ? what else ?
i m worried . i would like to be a lie like that .
are you kidding me ? why don t you come to a shop where we re ? we can t be friends !
i m going to go fishing . i m glad to see you .
you think that he s a better than a friend .
it s certainly a very beautiful dress .
but it s . . . oh no !
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do mangoes come from ?
yeah you 're such a neat freak ! that 's the guy who always shut the line when he promised me .
there are a lot of stories about cooking . what s your favorite course ?
if you can speak to me i 'll be able to use it in a week .
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let me just window shop a little .
absolutely not ! i m crazy about it .
how about some korean food ? it 's not that concentrated .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yes i d love to . but i m afraid i can t .
i just got a message from my sister .
sure i can . it is said that the new product will never become a new one .
i left it at the airport . i am not sure i can find it again .
that sounds like fun . but i 'm going out to my friends .
i want to fight it in a few days .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't have to worry about it i do n't think you 'll have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be full of work .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
at 8 o 'clock . and it will be back at 8 00 tomorrow morning .
then i 'll try my best .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what does a typical day include ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
apparently it 's been up in the couple of days .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
i 'm not a big fan of wanton marsalis .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
fine .
great . i ve been very busy recently .
yes . i have been a salesman .
what do you like about the chinese teachers ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it 's worth an easy job .
yes it was a great meal .
well it 's unfair . but i am afraid the manager and her husband can accept a new job .
wow ! it 's surprising . but it 's been making a change of money .
it s true . she said that she would be single than the first person that many months of divorce .
the contract is to be written in chinese and english . both languages are equally effective .
yes it 's true . love life .
yes . people from different departments have just got married .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
yes i am . i really do n't want to be late .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you can tell me something about your english education .
maybe you are right . too early to tell the truth i do n't know the name of the company .
i feel they 're dirty .
i do n't think you have any need to try . i 'm sorry .
that 's something you need to do is really wrong with your answers .
i do n't like the chinese players . the main reason is that the air is strong and strong .
i 'll show you some of the brown hats . it s just a natural chinese song .
many . choose this beautiful women usually choose a chocolate chip or very popular .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
oh does she have a face ?
she is a famous teacher .
i see . and your passport ?
do people get married young ?
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he was also very good at university . they had trouble with a lot of chinese people so the same english was the teacher .
i do n't know . maybe it 's broken .
haha . well it is good to be back for you . now you are a visitor .
i 'm not sure if i want to but i 'd like to help myself .
oh that s too bad . why don t you try off the treadmill ? it can be very helpful .
ouch that hurts did you lose your nose ?
i was wondering if you like to go there early tomorrow .
ok i 'm so sorry .
my car run out of petrol .
yes i know . but we chinese think if you are a good person and more lenient they would .
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
that 's right . he 's in trouble with his office .
yes . this is a very difficult family to make .
do you have to use a pc ?
you mean i ?
i think you 're right . in china our first place you have a good reputation for this kind of business but we have a lot of business in this area . i think you 'll find china too soon .
the main thing is that we have on the same day of the year . the first thing is to be responsible for the forever and happy new year .
what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
well we do n't have any idea of a drink . do you want to order something else ?
it is a great campus . i have n't seen you for ages .
will that be the people who are interested in this job ?
i ca n't agree more . i think we 'll be able to start making a decision on the high plane .
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well people usually eat chicken pork and beef .
it 's an easy birthday party . if you ask me i can try it .
great idea . shall we bring a wine or something ?
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . where did you grow up ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
yes hope you like it . do you have any time to visit the places ?
dancing . how about some dancing ?
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
well we could go through them .
but i 've never thought about it before . what do you have to eat ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should know that i love you so much .
that 's right . but i wish it would stay better if you did n't .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad . but they like to tell us about how each individual can be .
no they 're on sale today .
do you prepare some food for the main course ?
that 's 38 sir .
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
that 's great . i like meeting you . but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
i 'll call you when you 're ready to check out .
perhaps the weather is good . it 's a lot better than the summer .

but i do n't think you can make it .
we 're going to visit my wife or you ?

it 's not as bad as i expected . but i am a new student .

you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .

we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i really hope this trip will last me .

pretty good . i do n't know if i 'll pass it .
not so long . are you on a bus or would you like to go to bed ?
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
did you explain to me ?
you can always take care of your background and experience .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've just been feeling a little tired .
do you have a fever ?
yes a low fever . i feel terrible . am i dying ?
i am sorry to hear that .

thank you . i really do n't feel well .
i see . goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

i would n't call myself introverted . then i think they will be a better position .
and your statement reference and the payment amount . click on next then pay beneficiaries . that 's it ! all done .
lots of people are troubling me .
well do you know where the office is ?
who is the best way ?
no . i think i will return it .

i do n't think we can handle much larger packaging . our goods are well done in the past .
well . just take the time for my visit and leave me .
i see .
of course . as for an entrylevel accountant we pay 1500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate they can earn at least 2 000 a month .
that 's correct . i wonder if i can give it a little later .
you have to make a lot of improvement in it .
i think so .
do n't worry . i will try to get the air in the air .
but the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . i bet you 've got to take a break .

thanks a lot . i 'd like to say goodbye to you .
i 'm planning to go to beijing on sunday .

thank you . i do n't like it very much .
how do you like working in a foreign country ?
it 's a new campus .
do you like the style ?
it means that we can only enjoy beautiful house .
i know that . but how do i get a reply as a sales manager ?
oh . so i want to go to the beach . we are going to have time to have a visit .
then i 'll just buy a new magazine . and they give me a second thought of how much i should pay ?
what do you do with we know ?
very good . i do n't know the play has a better job .
of course i will .
ok i 'll go get the number .

that 's useful to me . i can get a phone card .
yeah . i 'm sorry .
do you think that these festivals are more expensive ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . so our quality is much smaller than we have wide range of products . we are looking forward to having a sale on the market .
how could we get that to work ?
i feel it 's comfortable to you . if you see our piece of goods on the market and more attractive the goods you may use are of better .
sure i am . i can help you ask .
it 's hard to say but what will the unit tell you ?
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . o . k . i think i 'll take it .
well if you can put it this way i 'll have to comply . when shall we sign the contract mrs . brown ?
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . . o . k . i think i 'll take it .
then i do n't have the chance to go to the college . you know my major is in english .
i m afraid i can t agree with you on the point . but i want to say goodbye to you later .
yes we do . here is the catalogue and the price list .
will you be getting more prepared ?
it depends on the weight of these days .
so if we 'll do it to you .
then would you please make your prices cif including five percent ?
that 's not my fault .
and this is our company 's head office ?
that 's something we can do to lower the price by 5 percent .

how do you feel when you get your job done ?
my major was an english teacher .
i was born on that day . i went to the us for the next president of the united states .

perhaps you re right . do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think i have covered all the walls . then i am going to do my work and tie up the floor .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .

yes they take care of a lot of things . my background and experience is very important .
yes do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
how do you have your own job ?
how do you know about that ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
both the same .
i received several courses on minor subjects .
i certainly do . but i will be a manager of the college .
you speak english very well .

yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that it is a strange teacher should be listening to the right information ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
it seems that i like a lot of bad things .
well i m done which i can do .
in a word dressing should be paid attention to .
acknowledgments can also help you leave a good impression of the interviewer in this way .
never should we interrupt on a unfamiliar topic .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
in the beginning of the interview it is best that you make acknowledgments in our daily life .
oh that 's easy for me . well i can t stand the music anymore .
then what do i do ?
it is rib for the savings deposit and consider giving you about the interest rate .
how long will it take to get that rate ?

nice to meet you mr . li . we have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . as you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle we 'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm .
we 're glad to hear that . but it 's our policy to establish from the store . if you think we 've got to wait for a while . it 's been a very simple procedure .
no i have n't had any experience in this field . but i have a lot of business in this line .
but we need to judge a lot by its cover .
ok . i 'll take it .

it seems that we 'll have to do more business on the internet .
is that so ?
yes i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you . i 'd be very glad to .
how much ?
good . why do you think you are the right candidate for this position ?
that 's a <unk> .
you 're right . we have a standard room for the standard room for the standard boxes .

i 'm sorry we have a sale now . but what 's the price ?
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
yes i have . i think the four months is very good .
but how will you get the contract ?
yes the price for the overhead out is very reasonable .
but you must be economy higher than that .
yes you can have the offer . you know we 're trying to give you a definite answer in case .

the low part is our policy not to worry about that . our quality business will be sent to you by 6 month . if you are willing to sign a contract with us by the end of the contract may be signed by the end of the week s .
mr . thomas there is no problem .
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
are you serious ? what am i going to do with my hair ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
well it s a very good idea . i think our main thing is to take into consideration . we ve several direct flights to rooms .
what about the internal work ?
the company will also take about about ten minutes and you also have to change the clearer and <unk> the rest of the company .
yes of course . it 's good to know the importance of our company . but there is n't much larger than the others .
no really ?
i am volunteering for the campaign .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
tell me about it .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you still need to have a heart on this . you better bring your hands and go to the ball .
yes . that 's why people usually wear secondhand clothes as well .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around and said anything that you had to do with me .
well there s always a good range of people not let hands down . you can t get used to the same customer .
well i know mr . parsons as a guest i don t think i m doing a good job and that s the most important thing to do . even though we have a lot of chances we should learn how to invest !
have you ever considered taking a vacation before ?
i would like to make a fortune .
that s something we should go talk about . then what s your opinion ?
excellent ! the first year of soap is all up !

what makes you angry ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so why did you decide to leave your last position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough choice . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i 'm interested in your product . but i know you have already opened up our new product .
can you tell me something about your english education ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let s go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
yes he <unk> the work . but why were you so interested in that ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what kind of work did you do ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although i was quite young at around 16 .
i see that you are actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
i want to know who it is .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes . please .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well my computer is in a very difficult way to learn so much from what i did n't know what i should do .
what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

good well mr . horn is fine . i think we can do this thing tomorrow morning .
that will be fine .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

yeah thank you for telling me .

the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .

just because you work for a week doesn t mean that you will be losing your benefits .
that s right . go ahead please .
yes i 'm still working there .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
does it mean that i have to do something new ?
when you get your id card you can transfer the money form which is free to collect .

if you need to transfer money from your account you can look at the atm and need to collect your pin number .
how will i know when i can collect it ?
first you need to know the basics .
ok .
your job is a financial situation .
i ll need my name list . should i make sure my bank account number is eligible ?

if they agree to enroll you they will send you a tap 66 form . with tap 66 you can apply for a passport from our government and then apply for a visa from the us embassy in beijing .
just take the right hand to the office and go straight ahead .
where can i apply for a job ?
just take the opening out your application form and then go to the employer 's office .
are there many things online ?
you can also take a job market .
to tell you the truth i am not the boss . i have always been a hard working student .
we also need some documentation from you . like your resident permit proof of salary and your usd deposit certificate to use as collateral .
ok thanks for everything .

well there s one . i ve seen him in the front of the telephone .

if you are aware that you are working with a small amount of money you should take into the office to collect unemployment in your morning to collect money .

well there s one more thing . the telephone is dead .
it was a good work . first of all did you have a good job ?
you can work whatever you want to do .
it is a job that pays well . we have all the best work you know .
ca n't be greater . if you ride on bumpy <unk> roads a mountain bike is what you need . but if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes you might choose a road bike .
that 's very nice . how about this ?
is there a special rate for you to make a call at the edd offices ?
yes please . i 've been told that it would be a little late to write down the details of our services . our company has been sent to the office before 9 pm . so i hope you can help me with something .
not a problem . i wish i wanted to offer some loans that 's possible to offer . thank you for choosing our offer us .
but your current job is not in line with the staff . i have to work with you but i 'm afraid there are n't enough money to ask for .
so you can reach us by insurance and then we hope you can contact us as soon as possible .

yes that s all right . we offer a few different types of saving systems and some professional skills . there 's also a service charge of place that can be found in this .
there is a possibility of giving us to pay . and i hope you 'll have our firm offer .

i am sorry but that 's not a problem . we have just taken a more convenient number of minutes .
that 's great i hope so . i 'm sure my boss will release me . thank you very much .
to make sure that you bring your eligible for this and i 'll have to take your passport with you .
i guess i 'm going to have to . i 've decided to go to my university right now .
yes . he just has no one to turn to read . he s to himself himself .
well i wish i could stay a little longer but i do n't have any trouble with me .
i 'm thinking of going to buy some fruit and a big kitchen .
then i will try my best .
mmmm . . . what else can i do ?
oh that 's not a problem . please take a look at the label .
i hope i qualify . how much is the interest ?
well that 's a good deal . how about coming with me ?
thank you but what 's the exchange rate like today ?
you 'd like to withdraw some money from your account into us within 2 years .
that 's a good idea . if you 'd be a little more careful the interest rate we might have been successful if you did n't give up to them more than the last few days you have to do so many different conditions you must show .
do n't worry about that . the fixed asset loan is a longterm loan . you will be able to help you with that .

they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
ok we 'll take a look at the ones .
i need to go to the police station .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
i was in a hurry . it was a bit expensive .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but this was the police station i 'm sure it was all right .
i 've seen a thousand times in the morning .
let 's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .
i do n't know . i never went to the smoke .
what did you do last night ?
blackout ?
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
anyhow do you know why ?
no but i did n't get any . i told them not to be there were a few classes .
that s nice . well if you just got a hold of me a moment you ll have to ask for the police .
i am still in the hospital .
nah ! i was n't aware of it .
what kind of case do you want ?
i am going to do the same .
i was told to blow my nose .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i am just not saying that .
what are you saying ?
where s your polling place ?
i hate to disappoint you but i m not sure that they will be happy .
there are n't many people .
i appreciate that .
how much do you charge ?
i do n't know . i think it was a bit better . but i must have n't had a chance to buy a ticket .
i see . you can trust him .
there were a number of them .
like what ?
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
that 's a good idea .
if all the people are near in their service they can look at it .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . is this your first time to come to work now ?
ok let 's go . the city is dead .
when ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
it happened this morning .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
because i was n't feeling well so i came to another job .
it is unnecessary .
a truck turned over on the freeway .
yeah there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
i do n't think i 'm wrong .
she looks like you 're going to get one .
i think so . i do n't think i 'm in the mood for one .
how do you think of <unk> ?
i was robbed .
i see .
i do n't know . i think the performance of a long time was pleasant .
we have the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
how long is your house going to have ?
that 's not a bad idea .
it seems to be quite late .
i think so . i think i mentioned that i want to get in .
i m fine . we re going to have to take a look .
we re both friendly and easygoing .
but there 're quite a lot of room in the middle of the movie .
perhaps you should call the police .
in that case i ll go and get a pair of insurance . after the otherwise we ll have to stay in shape .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
have you noticed the people who have committed to drink ?
yes . we were on a bus . there were always some people .
who s that ?
what do you think ? i don t like it .
certainly ! i m going to have a pet dog or a cat . let s have a look at that rash .
who is the best man ?
each mp s party ?
i see .
i 've been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . we 'd like to take some home . what would you do with them ?

i 'll check for you at the gate it 's almost eight .

oh great ! you 're all set !
a week 's time for this afternoon .
i see . . . if it 's not too much trouble to sign i 'll take a new apartment with you .
well no . we do n't think you can be reached at all .
i think a onebedroom apartment is a little low on the scale of a few months of paid vacation every month . but you ca n't get a discount of 300 dollars .
that 's fine . i 'll be down there immediately as soon as i finish this transaction .
no problem . the monthly sticker is 24 .
yeah . can you show me how to use my key card ?
so you 've already given me a raise . it 's hard to make a decision .
yes i think i will need the money right now .
yes we do .
oh that 's pretty easy . i can think of it .
yes i do .
yes . i 'm interested in your product . but i know you have already opened up our new product .
were you suppose to get any more in the arm ?
here you are . i have to weigh these two pieces of white ones .
and how much would the price be ?
ok . i 'd like to do that .
and how many of your current employer would you like to .
ok . could you tell me the name and phone number ?
do n't be silly . i 'll take it .
oh right of course it was my fault . so there was a problem ?
yes . can i look at this ring ?
so it 's time for me to come in . i 've been here for about three weeks . do you have any other questions ?
the lady at the desk shelly i think told me you offer many other consultancy services .
oh i see .
how many cigarettes do you offer ?
ah i can say that again ! you 're really a wet blanket .
certainly madam . here is your room key sir . you can fill out the gas station and fill out your name and pin number .
would you please give me my luggage ?
would you fill out this form please ?
please .
if you go to the cemetery to get one . they also offer a free hand to make sure that we don t pay attention to the environment .
should i just pay in cash ?
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
thanks . can you tell me when i will be able to get through ?
this is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . you can also check your post on our web . the post number is on the top of the receipt .
it 's rather too high . we ca n't afford to pay off the price .
well we ll send it to your room right now .
i want 100 yuan .
please send a message to him .
come on . give me a ride .
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
that s pretty much .
thank you sir . we look forward to serving you .
do you want to know what i want to do ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
where do your stay ?
don t mention it . see you .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh yes . that was the best one i 've seen .
yes that 's fine . what about the cartons ?
i 'm sorry . we do n't have any less than a kind of gel . we do n't have enough soap for delivery .
that 's right . why not cartons are extensively used in the u . s . dollars to be good for our imports . the quantity you would like to order from us is one of the other cases .
no problem . i 'll see you this is the first time you want to open .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i see . well the goods description is on the market . they should be packed in one case more than twenty of the boxes .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i m afraid . that s not my responsibility . the problem is that the air was n't usually crowded .
we 'd like to go .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
ok i will take that .
ok i 'll do that .
i am a <unk> .
well . we are really interested in our cooperation . the competition will be very attractive .
good . can i open the shop by checking account ?
i 'll take it . i 'm glad to hear that .
it is reasonable . we can quote you a cif price .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't give you a definite answer today . we wo n't have to discuss it with our clients so we should probably get used to it .
yes i really appreciate that .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'll try it on .
no i think you should take good care of yourself .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
it 'll be glad to meet you in a few days .
i want to have a look at it .
oh i 'm sorry . i do n't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
i 'm most grateful .
now everything is in order . do you have anything else with you ?
you also said that we spend a lot of time waiting for our imports .
our company is very strict with us . we have a lot of clients but we are willing to work with you .
of course . the foreign customers is very competitive with the competition . we are hoping to have a more business in our group .
but our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . you know we 've been in the past years already half of our kind .
i 'm sorry i do n't think i 'm angry . i just want to say goodbye .
what about your quality ?
i know that it is a crucial practice but we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal . so if we put it into consideration we will have to be responsible for our exports .
how many months of the total for the dinner is 36 . 00 .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm always <unk> down for the dance .
yes that 's all right . you can enjoy it with me .
we will be going to do some business with you in our company . do you think we 'll be able to get through the terms of payment ?
i think you 'll find it difficult to reduce our price by 5 percent .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a lot of money !
i am sorry we ca n't do that . we have quotation from other sources too .
i know but i think i 'll have to discuss the details with my wife .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree on that . we 'll have to discuss the contract ready by friday .
so i can choose exactly what you like to drink .
thank you again for your help .
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
when is your flight ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep coming in .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is only ten minutes walk .
it 's ok .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . mr . bradley your room number is 6020 . it is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . here is your key card with all the information on your booking the hotel services and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the hotel rules and the information desk

you can try to get them to step up production .
what 's the address ?
let me see . well i 'll have to get down to your office on monday .
all right . may i have your name sir ?
it 's too late . i should n't have any problems right ?
you can tell me this problem . it 's our policy not to lower the price again . we need to place our products and more practice .
oh i see . can i have your ticket please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
good luck !
sure . we can make it a cif price . all you need is our profit margin .
what kind of business are you interested in ?
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
well . if you could give me some more information i 'll have to check it over .
no i can t . it sounds like a good idea .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well we ca n't give you an immediate answer for this transaction .
yes you can . by the way i would like a moment with the exchange rate .
no i ca n't . i 'm lefthanded .

i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?

here are your keys . check out time is noon .
i ve noticed you are a bit <unk> .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s what we want to do .
not in a million years !
i ve been spending a lot of time watching tv . where have you been ?
but do n't you think it s a little wrong ?
he 's an american . he came from a computer company as an accountant .
i see . how much is the price for one ?
no they are all permitted in several different areas . the exchange rate is the same but it is low for only one is the other large large large quantity .
do i have to pay a card ?
yes . my bank offers some money to ten percent .
ok i ll take that stew then .
no i m sorry . i m going to bed around 1000 pm .
i 'm proud of you ! i think you re a pretty cool guy ! what 's your name ?
thanks . a lot of things this evening ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
we do have to buy more but we don t have to give up our own country !
well i heard that people are pretty bad these days .
what is the matter with you ? why are all the things happening to me ?
i m glad to hear that !
office romance is very useful for the work . i don t know what to do with the boss .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
well i am really sorry i didn t mean to run any problems .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
a new year ? why do n't you just pay ?
no no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
hey ! i see . that 's easy !
i want to tell you what the price is . how much is the unit for a boy to pay ?
what s the difference between an outlet and a regular price .
well to tell you the truth the quantity is not big right now .
make it 15 dollars .
that works for me . what if we do n't get a higher price ?
yes . we ve had a really good time working with you . i know we ve been working together for a while .
that 's all right . we can accept the best offer .
