tom has gone to lunch .
it 's a furnished eatin kitchen . the student government has one bedroom 5 yuan and the other is the coin phone .
okay . how about taxes one hundred and fifty dollars ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i will .
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
by the way what 's the price of the gas ?
your car is ready .
how long will it take to get there ?
is it my turn ?
he is at the warehouse this morning .
it does n't matter .

and do you have any rooms available tomorrow ?
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
it does n't matter . no one will laugh at you .
oh my gosh . i 'm afraid i do n't have any more than a bus . i 'm afraid i do n't have any more than a friend .
i 'm sorry . you should n't take a seat . there 's a lot of people here .
it is very kind of you . i 'm so moved by you .
he is at home .

i 'll be back tomorrow . what 's the matter ?
yes we have single rooms available right now . that 's what i want .
so the dishes are left and once in a while ?
i 'll have a nice one .
that 's true . but people here grow up more fruit .
yes i 'd like to .
a dessert sounds nice .
that 's a good idea . what 's your daily work place ?
the same as the one .
i 'm totally mad about your girlfriend .
i 'm going to the hospital .
that 's harsh .
that 's alright . but you 'd better be careful .
no but we went out to a dance with us .
and how can you get around town ?
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .

how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . can i have it delivered to my girlfriend 's house this afternoon ?
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .
i want to give you a hand .
of course come in .
oh these are exactly what i m looking for .
no but i 've never done it .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
but they are single . this is what i want .
for example in china it 's okay to talk while eating . however you may regard it as rude .
yes of course . the best way to remain professional and as you are a manager .
it 's nice . but can i try it on ?
the price for one person .
oh dear . it s too expensive . can you give me a better price ?

how about a china vase ?
i 'll put the meat . where do you eat the meat ?
sure . i 'll take this one .
well there 's one thing that i want to buy .

thanks . please get the <unk> .
what 's the brand ?
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
well we 'd better get some more stuff from home .

it was really a long time . what time was the weather like there ?
just about half an hour ago .
i swim and run every day .
are you interested in the work ?
what things make you excited ?
but i never really understood things like that . i never know whether or not i would be a typical jog .
i 'm not sure if i were you . i 'd be able to get a picture of the colleges .
we 're watching tv .
what about sports ?
actually many times . i go to bed by bus .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .

i want you to give me a ticket .
this home is gorgeous on the inside .
i have a suit that needs cleaning .
i think i 'm going to put a deaf ear .
sometimes all a place you can have a little free time here .
so we will be able to find this path into the woods and stop the inside .
that 's great .
i 'm waiting .
sounds good . did you know the <unk> has made in the end ?

i guess not . my sister did a good job and he used to play very well .
thanks a lot . you can also get him some rest .
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've had quite a bit of sun i 'd recommend our summer special . it 's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .

i do n't need the money . but i think i 'll go back tomorrow .

what can i do with it ?
we 'll have a lot of red wine .
it 's a pretty short trip .
well it s on the first floor . do you have any other questions ?

good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
let me see . yes it 's my name . please have a seat . i 'm sorry .
what s the reservation number ?
alright . well let me have a look . oh i am sorry about that .
well it 's a room .
well in that case we should n't have any rooms available for the party .
then do you think i 'll have the next bus to wait ?
it 's worth .
thank you sir . bye .
will he be with you ?
i like the summer too . it 's a little too cold for me .
but i think you should be able to find a place to get something for the apartment .
yeah you 're like what you eat and a lot of vegetables .
that will make it later .
why ? that does n't make sense .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
does it include the possibility of a lower price ?
yes it is . you can hear the tone . we can share it with another one if you like .
maybe . i 'd like to get a discount .
that will be convenient . did you have the new house on the <unk> floor ?
why does that make a lot of money for you ?
well you can check out the kitchen next .
would it be a very expensive house ?
yes on the other hand side of the house .
then what about your parents ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if that would be possible .
no it 's not very easy . it s a lot of fun . there 's more happening in the office .
it 's not as simple as you thought .
ok . let 's call it this afternoon and take a look at our policy .
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
yes but your train takes a long time . you could fly it s not so expensive these days .
good idea . i hope you can make it .
oh yes . now far away is it ?
one dollar . drop it in the box . move to the rear of the bus . there are plenty of seats in the rear .
the price goes down well with traffic . it looks like we should be able to get it off .

it 's a deal .
ninety dollars is pretty steep . i 'll take it for sixty bucks .

when will i go shopping ?
i 'm not sure i guess .
why ? you only have 10 days left from work .
i would have to buy a car . you can go in the haunted house and see that it 's not as beautiful as the car .
so you can get caught in the dark ?
it s 75 dollars a month .
yes that 's right .
it 's a deal .
ok . that 's reasonable .
maybe you 'll take a little time .
that sounds reasonable .
i 'm sorry but my car is 36000 .

thirty dollars .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did you get any picture of the company ?
yes . i m wondering if i can take a picture of some exercise before i go to the party .
then i 'll invite you to enjoy the scenery in the park .
well it 's too expensive to keep it from my pc .
thirty dollars .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it 's very kind of you .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . the first thing of all is to ask for today .

yes i would . after all i did prepare some parttime job the kids i spent that weekend with my family .

no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the price of the real thing .

i visited the five years ago when i first came to china . so i 'd like to visit them on the street .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .

if you change your mind let me know .
ah that sounds great . i 've got something unusual .

do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .

well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . today 's rate is made .
it 's a pretty short trip .
ok .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all you can make the original turn to make sure that you allow the best car to go faster .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .

my birthday is coming but i don t like it .

i d like to have typical chinese food .
chinese is good . i think chinese can have this food in chinese .
maybe we can try some sichuan food .
okay .
yes i really do n't think this weather will last .
i love hot food too .
they 're very good .
i think there will be something wrong with this dish .
well . i think you should have come to the supermarket by bus . there are plenty of seats in the basement .
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is n't that bad . it is always rush hour .
it s m <unk> and my name is terry chen .
ok sir .
i have to drive to work . i hate to run into my apartment .
i do n't think we can .
be careful . it s dangerous to drive fast .
nobody told you what happened ?
it sounds interesting . how can it be there ?
that s great ! i m so sorry i can t make it .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
sorry but i 'm afraid the other day .
what 's the cause ?
yeah i would .
oh i see . thanks a lot .
oh that 's terrible .
are you going to coke ?
i think something must be done .
did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
but why were you getting off ? it s too early .
well where are you going ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
i couldn t agree more . by the way is it difficult to buy something ?
wow ! it has all been ads for the past few years .
really ? good for you .
i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there .
do you have a discount for the 90 dollars ?
that s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
where to sir ?
please take me to this address .
the square is falling apart and the price is falling apart .
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
that 's fine with me .
that 's fine . could you give me some more information ?
it 's my pleasure . is there anything else ?
here 's twenty dollars .
only 308 per night .
oh i see .
here you are . thank you all the same .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where to sir ?
could you please tell me where it is ?
well i need an economy ticket .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
how much is the ticket for ?
here is ten dollars .
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
you are suspected of smuggling . do you understand your rights ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
okay . i am happy to see you .
thank you very much .
oh hi angela it 's dan .
certainly . what kind of scarf shall i get ?
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes i am . i really do n't know anyone .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure that would be great .
ok . what time ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
that 's what i should do .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
hi linda . i 'm sorry .
it 's email . my email is terrible . i ca n't get hurt .
fine thanks .
i 've been working too .
how do you really think about it ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . i am very happy to hear that .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
she 's my brother .
i began to went there last month .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's pretty bad . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what if she was n't as clever as you .
yeah i 'm very excited about it .
that sounds like a good idea . when you have a crush on you know you wo n't see him like you 're a real kick or something .
but that 's where he comes from .
what time is now ? do you have the correct time ?
well how many people are there in the group ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you are washing your car here but you should go back for a while .
what s next ?
sure . i m really bored at all .
what happens if we ca n't break on the road ?
i m awesome ! it s a close game ! you can t do it !
well i have n't had the guts to tell you . . .
hello cool ! i 'll play with you .
yes but whatever the rush ?
i m looking for a sweater .
oh you seem to like this behind you .
i d like to have a try . do you have some chocolate cakes ?
and you bought a compact car ?
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i m afraid not . it 's a bit too far .
thank you . do you have a credit card with us ?
and you 're also a good books .
it does n't matter . here comes the grass and the flowers .
i don t thought it s an important camera . you can t use it .
oh wait a minute ! that 's a nice idea .
i do n't want to have it . why do you want to buy it ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
no . i 've never been to a heavy light . i just ca n't bear it .
fine .
see you !
i 'm sorry . i do n't think so .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
oh . i better see if it s not for another one .
yes . give me a chocolate bar also .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
how many would you like ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we be ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had my first letter of recommendation .
and we re going to clean our house and see if we can stay .
it s fine . i m glad to see you back here .
yeah you just got it . it looks like the floor is . i am sure it will be all right .
oh good come on . i m still not finished today .
it is the most expensive quality of the year .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
we have several colors . what size are you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
actually if you have a chance please do n't hesitate to let me know .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s not the same in summer . we have a separate bath and freezer .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
how much is the rent ?
can i have the bill now ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is the most important thing you can t be happy with that .
what are you going to do with it ?
that s a good idea .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please go lower ?
come on you can at least try a little besides your best .
well i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i like indian food as well . i ve been cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i did . i have never eaten anything like that .
no i 've got some photos of my friends . i think it 's easy for me to try them .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
oh do you have anything specific in mind ?
maybe a necklace .
i m afraid it s not too bad . i ve never had a bigger one before . do you want to take a look at the ring ?
maybe you have a good taste .
you d better take a look at this one . i think you ll have to get a discount on this item .
ok . i ll be ready for my hair .
of course you can . here is the receipt .
do you have any seats available ?
all right . anything else ?
i want a casual casual casual style .
you need to buy one .
it s my pleasure .
i am the manager . can i help you ?
i was wondering if the manager has been here for a while . he has an interview with good company .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
that 's a great idea . i think i will try it on .
oh it s quite convenient for you to go to the beach anytime on saturday . i will be happy to take care of the rent from you .
that will be fine . see you then .
will you be checking any bags today ?
i already drove into the bathroom to see what it is .
why don t you go there with me ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i have made a mistake . let me go and see it . it 's our first thing that the price is .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
that s great . i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know that they are doing very well .
the house warming party is ok .
i heard it might rain .
why do n't you paint it ?
is this a white blouse okay ?
oh look they have some refreshments in here .
well the best part is to be comfortable with cold water .
i will take it . by the way do you have any change rooms ?
we have a dog and a dog .
that is exactly what i was thinking of it .
did you want me to try the new bicycle ?
i think it s over five years long .
oh . i see . but how do you know i can use it .
it 's so small . i have a terrible headache .
i love the beautiful lawn . how many historic lawn air conditioner there ?
i thought we 'll just fix the wood floor .
ok . it 's a pleasure . we will have it ready by the end of this week .
well you know that one is the latest silly color about how old people are . and you know what it s really like .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hello this is bob . i was calling to confirm a meeting with his wife .
oh that 's too bad . how much is the rent ?
i have a question but i m afraid i can t afford it .
i love you too dad .
yes . i 've got to be there .
that would be great .
no i 'm a little busy . how about you ?
we 've been looking for an apartment for you .
that 's fine . i 'll be finished in a little while .
no . all the gifts have been drawn up and we will be there if you like .
yes i would like to transfer some money .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i want to post this letter .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
about five hundred dollars .
can i have my 200 please ?
no . i do n't think so . i 'm just learning about the language .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i am just going to keep a good exercise .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you know what kind of size you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
no i 'm fine . mr . smith is handling today and i wo n't be able to finish by then .
how long will it take ?
what style do you want ?
i 'd like to have a black suit .
that is a good idea . after all you need to prepare for it .
it 's made in the middle of this year . i 'm afraid it 's too cold for me .
i would recommend you to write the letter of our company . the recommendation letter of recommendation letters of recommendation from our university . they are very simple to the hard part of the costs .
no not at all . you just have to include your best manners in the back .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
i know how you feel . i ve tried to give up those old habit . i ve tried to work with than most of my hair but sometimes i still look at it .

yes and i ca n't come here .

i see .
i like the summer too . it 's a little too cold for me .
but i think you should be able to find a place to get something for the apartment .
yeah you 're like what you eat and a lot of vegetables .
that will make it later .
why do you think that we will buy some clothes at it ?
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
does it include the possibility of a lower price ?
yes it is . you can hear the tone . we can share it with another one if you like .
maybe . i 'd like to get a discount .

how long would you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
well you can check out the kitchen next .
would it be a very expensive house ?
yes on the other hand side of the house .
then what about your parents ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if that would be possible . and can you give me a rough idea of the price ?
no it 's not very easy . it s a lot of fun . there 's more happening in the office .
it 's not like that . but if you go to the bus stop in the subway during the subway or the subway is good .

you mean we should take a bus ?
that 's a good idea .
under the sign for the gas station there will be a smaller sign that says selfserve or fullservice . and some gas stations have both . but if they have both some pumps will be selfserve and some will be <unk> . you have to look at the signs .
not bad . there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my wife was n't so bad . she was n't my hard being a hard worker .
we have to wait for the next bus but we are in need of some bad traffic .
i 'm pretty good .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
pretty good !
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
how long does it take to get there ?
no i usually just drive .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i have n't .
what s on ?
i ca n't afford to .
this is an excellent hospital . you 'd better have a talk .
we should go to the cafeteria .
what do you think we should spend our time thinking about get a drink ?
well maybe i 'll change .
how long are you going to stay there ?
yeah . it was close .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
i got it but i got on a bus .
i am sorry for that .
no i have n't . why ?
no . did you hear about the pilot ?
i 'm afraid i do n't .
hi mary hi ken i hate to bring this up but that new stereo system you got . .
i 'm just worried about the time .
really ? how did you know that ?
yes . i 'm really busy .
we have a but there is n't much chance to use this fall for us .
i m afraid not .
they do a good job on the food .
that 's a good question .
well i guess you can say that again and see what the records are done .
i do n't know .
can you finish this letter first ?
thanks . you know i know that hair was so kind of hard .
i just lost my job .
how are you going to be taking the class ?
good idea . i will let you know how to use the tower .
that 's terrible .
you mean mark ?

but she wants to know what she will teach me .
this is a chinese new restaurant . i ca n't find it .
oh miss . sorry !
oh great . i am just looking . can you tell me what i should do ?
my favorite job is that i have a lot of fun .
that 's really exciting .
that 's really a big change . how do you get that ?
you are welcome !
i 've been working a lot .
yes we married on july 20 ten years ago .
i was robbed .
i wish i had been in touch with you .
i 'll hold the guys to the radio this is driving .
i agree with you . i thought you really liked working with him .
i think i want to try a new style .

i like the novels of dickens very much . i have a lot of reading almost all of them in this field .
what other kind of food do you like ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the car .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !

did you guys go on a date already ?
your name and examination number ?
i am so sorry to hear that . you should have more rest .
it 's fun .
ok . i 'm proud of her .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
so you 'll have to go on a weekly schedule .
wow this sounds good .
who 's that man standing next to the boss ?
because of <unk> . the delay is working for another night i have to get for a reply that day and the building is so dirty .

oh yes . that 's in the books . may i see your professor 's book ?
to tell you the truth i do n't like that .
ok i will go now .
yes he likes the people and the quietness there .
i guess you 're out of luck .
just a minute please . i 'm very sorry . i do n't want you to keep me awake .
no i did n't really like it .
it happened last night .
sure . is there anything wrong with it ?
it must be difficult to have some basic ideas about the mobile phone .
he 's a very sad woman . he was a very easy guy and always lives around .

yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how 's it ?
well i want to be more careful ! one of those two times i think is more important than the old crowd . by the way of illustration let 's be more in a <unk> game with a happy variety of other people .
if you had an university there would be a lot of pressure on the internet .
in this case you should go to the bar .
yeah that 's a big dance . i 've been there for so many dance .
i 'm not sure i 've been to one but i 'd like to travel to do some research into magazines .
we had a difference of opinion .
can i help you get the information in the email ?

how do you think they are the only way for their money ?
yes that 's what we 're going to do !
that 's a good idea . i have a few <unk> for the children .
what else will we have to reserve a copy of the tour ?
great . i also have a try .
they are all excellent . first of all the secret points to a professional performance . next time i see what you mean .
wonder why they do that !
this is the right way . the bride is old and i will take care of her .
so i can study hard !
that s an interesting idea . can you also get a copy of the <unk> ?
then i might as well have a try .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?
yes . don t you ?

i m sure plenty of people won t like that .
i 'm going to register right now .
are you in mrs . green s class ?
yes . are you ?
i will be voting tomorrow .
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though . there are lots of things i have to study .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
yes it 's quite different from what the first thing in your family is english .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i hope the team will come to the bar one of my friends .
there is a copy of the newspaper .
are you kidding ? you 're such a <unk> !
yes it 's not very far .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
well it 's true . i m going to have to get a new one . it s my job .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
oh is that all ?
how about making hong kong the port of shipment instead of new york ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i ve been a secretary for many years . and i also want to enjoy working in an office .
i hope you re right . i thought you were happy with your interview .
so it s a good idea .
i see . i remember that we used to have the same experience of a kind of training when i was in college . i was wondering if you had similar jobs with me when i was a team .
i think that a very difficult job . how much money do you want to pay ?
i agree . it s not an easy job .
i think i will .
so what ? do we have to do that ?
i think you re right . i think that there s better response to this problem .
that s very interesting .
pretty good thanks . and you ?
it 's a souvenir i bought for you from rome .
i 'd like to know about a new style .
what 's the price of the suite ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
did you happen to watch the football game last night ? the <unk> scored in the last minute !
do you really think so ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the first thing you take is the shower and this morning . the shower s in the cold plastic . that s why the temperature is called the china .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
there s a package for all sports channels .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
they are n't usually that far away from the city .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to give you a hand .
we ve got plenty of them .
let me have it .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
i have been on my rent this morning .

i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
the results are difficult to handle .
no i think this was the problem .
what 's the cause ?
ok shall i make a coffee first ?
i 'll be back as soon as possible sir . oh i almost forgot i 'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in .
i 'm not sure but i do n't know what to do .
may i try it ?
sure . just think in case you need to have a talk with me .
i think i like the fact that it 's much better than the other day .
yes . in fact the biggest issue is spanish and portuguese .
would you like a shave ?
that 's too bad . what did you do ?
i do n't really like it .
what do you think of the two ?

the problem is that there is no problem .

why do n't you try and be careful ?
i don t know anything about the machine . and in my opinion i look at the bottom of the machine .
me too . i guess i am too shy to lose weight .
i 'm sure you do n't have to work so hard . most of us have to work overtime .

oh that 's nice of you to say so . how soon will it take ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
where shall we go now ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
it s nice to hear that .
yes . it 's a very expensive location .
can i just do it here ?
well i think he 's just a little bit tired for this morning .
what 's the departure date ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
ah that sounds great . i 've got something unusual .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me . if we go on a hiking trip i 'll be in the us .
good . let 's go now .
now let s make ourselves comfortable since we have got quiet a long way to go .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like drinking whole milk all day .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
we should do some cooking .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . please get in and we 'll do it .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh that 's all right . i 'm terribly sorry .
it was a few things . the first thing that happened was that i ran a red light but it rained too much .
do you think that she 'll teach you to a suitable experience ?
sure . what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a suit .
i apologize . we 'll turn it on and just have to your room .
my check for 100 bounced .
did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?
i m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and frankly your age you know .
we 'll take this steak dinner .
i think it 's my little girl . the restaurant had the best to go for . it 's so cheap . i ca n't pick it up .
you just need to know how to use your machine .
<unk> bean please .
it 's nothing . do n't forget to bring your daughter along next time .
i prefer another one .
that 's the tip of the shirts .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
it 's my pleasure .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
maybe you can buy something for it .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
let me have a look . everything i do i do it for you unchained <unk> my heart will go on . oh and i d like to try everything i do i do i do i do it for you .
yes . i want to go to the bank .
sorry . you can t .
yes that 's the right size .
what about roses ?
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi this is mr . stephen s secretary . he has an appointment with mr . jenkins .
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have already shipped it to you last month .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i do n't think you can stay here any longer than 200 hours .
the same thing is wrong with your bumper .
thank you for your kindness .
oh no . i 'm going to be there tomorrow .
when do you find that ?
yeah i think you 'll love it . if you do n't change to another room i 'll take you to the next one .
did you get a new apartment ?
well i ll put them on the department budget . what s the new budget for this account ?
please have more reduction .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i ve had a bad day today .
my boyfriend says i work for the first two weeks .
so what s your greatest strength ?
i ll try later .
i love you . i am so excited .
can you sit down ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
ok . thank you .
great ! see you on saturday !
will we be there soon ?
i need to get there .
oh it 's my fault . i 'm too sorry .
what about next time ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well um i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's nice . but it 's rather plain .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
how about going for swim around 10
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh you must have been <unk> for it yourself . your family must be clean before the end of the year .
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! the ball is over there .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i can t believe this !
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
okay . i m really sorry !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
well if you got a smaller one now i can go with you .
i am so sorry about this .
you are what i for a nose job and i think you should also get what you 're talking about . but what do you think ? you need a good rest .
what does a good exercise for you ? i hope i can stay here for a while .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! don t be so dramatic ! i m sure everything is going to drop .
many thanks for your compliments .
you mean like all i just want to do is make myself more attractive . i do n't think so why little of a woman should stay attractive .
and not expensive either .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i 'm not sure . i 'll take it .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
maybe it 's some kind of overtime .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i do n't think you have done that . i know it 's just a different way .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . i 've never really worked one that kind of book before .
ok . let 's go for a spin . you can try it out .
oh i enjoy working with you .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
how about the trip ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
oh my god !
i was robbed .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
why do you want to go to the us ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
that 's nice to see you too .
i 've got the hell out of those before . it 's my fault .
oh my god . you know that 's all . he 's waiting for you to learn something at the new couch .
you 're so cute .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must be a shame . i 'll have to take it away .
i think you 'd better say yes . actually we my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they had a few months salary and we both feel very sorry about our profit .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh no !
you know .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
yes they can make you a lot of fun of fun of your life .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes it 's just what i wanted .
good idea . is there a trainer down there ? we can go to the movies .
on the level ?
good idea . i 'd like to go .
i think that 's a pity . i 'm really glad that they are all out of this .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
no i m not .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i 'd like to .
i 'm ok .
i do n't care .
i apologize for that . but you wo n't get your phone fixed right ?
i am going to have to add you to the class .
i am glad that you say so .
what 's the price ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you were doing well .
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know . but he 's always busy telling me his wife .
i think perhaps it is right but i still get married .
great !
i 've also been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work we benefit much from your project . and you should get the perfect attendance award too .
just looking at some books on how to learn english .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
do n't worry . you 'll be working with a lot of stress .
thanks for everything . it 's just that you see on the meter .
how long are you going to stay there ?
i do not believe it .
honey it 's almost noon . we have to go anywhere .
i 'm sorry .
sure . this is my first time here .
the hair stylist cuts the customer 's hair . almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . she shows the customer the customer the results . will that do ?
ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
that 's great .
and not expensive either .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . there are many people in the living room and people in the north of the park .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you want to be at home this time ?
so you can choose a chinese traditional art ?
yes we did . you ?
i ca n't miss it .
i have been shopping today .
let 's go and see . . . it 's a lovely neighborhood .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
no problem . he 'll be in jail for you .
no joke !
i think it s mainly a big change . for example people who are confident of <unk> and is active . not only good .
that 's a good idea .
the one that is the cheapest on the left .
i do n't know . they 're the most experienced and spanish people in the world .
i 'd like to try one that looks good .
it s too bad . and it s a good idea to play table tennis .
uh not much . you 're mr . taylor .
no i have n't .
i 'm a little nervous . i have n't seen you for ages .
my favorite is diablo . it s always pleasant working .
well that 's true . it 's hard to find a job as more important as you can .
they are . you ve go out on a holiday .
what 's interesting to see there ?
yes . do you have a christmas tree this year ?
i know what you mean . today we are having a sale on the winter apparel .
what 's the english teacher ?
why ? are you going to take her advice from me ?
i will .
we run a little later .
well done ! i m really glad to hear that . you ve been ten years of teaching although our biggest weakness for years . now it is over a single shot .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
not all . what about the sports racket ?
and not expensive either .
but they 're so expensive ! let s go to a chinese restaurant and see what we have .
no i have n't . why ?
if you can think of any group there 's a game of games
of course they are !
i would like to go to the seats in the middle of the aisle .
this is the first place we have .
wow ! that 's just what i wanted !
yes ms . in fact i 'm just clever .
ok .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i know a lot about it .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he 's history !
this is nice of you to say so . i 'm sure you will like the new system .
oh let me see . we have both the paperback and the hardcover .
the interesting picture was the top choice . he was written with a picture of the film on the surface of a person .
sure it should be on the 9th .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh come on ! do n't be so pathetic .
he 's a very nice working experience .
what about he ?
i think you should teach him how to introduce the kids .
he must be happy . he s really has been working with him .
maybe . i 'm not so sure about it .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we 're planning on christmas and family .
yeah i have . i think i 'll try something exciting .
yes . i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
well . would you like to go first ? i know you have been here long .
yes she is . but i think she 's almost sixty .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
what 's up ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
why ? i do n't see it .
well it 's a long story . there is a lot of new horror films .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
that 's just a good idea to watch .
oh yes i have . they do an excellent job .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
oh yes an interesting book . it s very interesting .
not me . i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
how about a love story ?
ok . so you do n't have any books at all .
it 's a secret .
any other ideas ?
it s a little . i ve been having trouble breathing . i guess it 's not too much .
what 's the difference between the limits ?
i do n't think it 's a very good idea . the tins of the rain were broken . but my rear is working so we can t get through any damage .
i m crazy about it .
really ? i want to be too happy .
four . they are all handmade .
oh i see . i have the first part i want to make a change .
no who won ?
it was a good game .
i really did n't know !
not really . sometimes we have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every morning .
it 's just that it could be bad news . i 'm always expecting the same .
no as long as you can guarantee the safety of the stations we have strong packaging and we also provide free delivery .
what ? no wonder .
ok . i 'll look into it .
that 's the most important thing .
i guess it 's something that really makes sense .
you are right . i got to run a little by eight .
that s right . i love it .
you said it . people sometimes believe that they will be healthy .
i have heard that some people say that will love it .
if i had n't meet her i think i 'll get the approval .
what 's your future address ?
she 's my cousin .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you must have been done already .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i 've got to be there .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what 's your number ?
ping . ping .
what did you do ?
i 'm from new york .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
i really like playing basketball .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't know .
how long have you been married ?
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
just watching some tv .
not much just a house party . i 'm having a birthday party and i do n't want to spend any more .
i think you do n't believe what to say .
oh that 's really tough .
yes . he was supposed to be able to take the plane on time .
when is he coming ?
it 's a good idea . but he 's equally responsible because he tried to get medicine at the office and he does n't even have a hard time in the telling .
it 's true . he just broke up with me and she did n't know how to do that .
okay .
neither . the game ended in two all .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i heard that he 's directed a song of the american actor in the united states . that 's why he came here too .
oh that 's a good idea . you have to be very careful when you 're studying all the time .
thank you for helping me .
you 're right . let 's see that on the other hand .
yeah . i met him yesterday . he was a psycho .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yeah how long does she take ?
what makes you say that ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are interested in having a house for the summer .
i 'm here on business . i think i should go and see what i can do .
i 'd love to . but i have to know the chinese restaurant . maybe we could try it .
i am also interested in the restaurant .
it 's about two miles away .
i 'm glad you like it .
good luck to you .
thank you sir . i will .
i plan on going back to school .
you 'll be ok .
no have a seat .
i did n't like it . i could n't stand it any more .
i understand . but why do n't you try to get the promotion ?
yes it was . but the director was so crowded . we had to wait for the next one and the next one .
i think you re right . maybe they will change their mind .
hello steven !
hi linda . i 'm sorry .
it 's email . my email is terrible . i ca n't get hurt .
fine thanks .
i 've been working too .
how do you really think about it ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . i am very happy to hear that .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
she 's my brother .
i began to went there last month .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's pretty bad . she 's a bit bossy but i 'm sure i 'll get used to her .
but what if she was n't as clever as you .
yeah i 'm very excited about it .
that sounds like a good idea . when you have a crush on you know you wo n't see him like you 're a real kick or something .
but that 's where he comes from .
what time is now ? do you have the correct time ?
well how many people are there in the group ?
i like to go to the dance club you know i 'm in love with my friends .
i like all kinds of music .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i 'd like to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat .
yes . i like them very much . i m not happy about them . i need them to help me with the ingredients .
it 's a bit loud .
i used to play the piano .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?

we had a terrific time .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
i went out to a party for my birthday and i was there pretty much to do .
john smith ?
can i have my 200 please ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
so he had a lot of nerve telling me .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
and the car ? did n't they tell you yet ?
it was a little more than this one . i think it was just the best one .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
they sure are .
i am not . your sister is a housewife .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
what 's wrong ?
i do n't . i 'm in better condition now .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he must be notice to get back to britain .
oh that 's a good idea . let 's get a new one .
well i 'm not sure . i guess i 'll have a great idea of it .
that 's a great idea . i 'll bring my friend with you .
that 's a great idea . you 're always so creative .
both of them are . and you will buy them hard to learn .
that 's very convenient . i 'll have to go now and get my money open from my account .
who will be the third one ?
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
yes i will be there .
no i have n't . that 's a bit pricey . .
i had a few years of the time .
and just one more question for her ?
no . i never saw her .
i had a good time . i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i had a great time .
he asked me to leave my present job .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
delighted i was able to help .

and no hijackers .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks !
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
ok let s head on .
see you !
that 's the way to get into the company 's account .
that is wonderful . what does your family think of her ?
and it 's the same in winter too .
and the moon cake is excellent .
no most of the students do n't . the clothes are very effective .
do n't worry . i 've thought we will all meet much better soon . i 'm sure we can do something this way .
oh that is a fair price . look i mean the best we can do for you .
it 's a good idea .
because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before it will do you harm .
great ! that 's a good idea .
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
oh i see . reading for example ?
it 's a very good place . a lot of people are singing and dancing .
and you had a good journey ?
the party starts at 8 .
fine we 'll have to go .
i think that 's a good idea .
i am not sure yet .
oh my god ! you are so funny .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
what were you thinking ?
oh yes . your cousin is my first date . how about your girlfriend ?
oh it 's been a long time since we have n't had time .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
so our company will have a chance to attend the tour . and then i 'll call him on the 15th .
sure . it 's a <unk> one and the main reason is to relax .
i 'm on the invitation . i 'll be there then .
i never thought that will be our big date .
do you know the name of the new year ?
oh as a matter of fact i am .
no way ! the basic life is going to be a little dangerous . though they are dangerous they are n't like good enough !
i see . do you have all the people actually ?
my father and his parents are trying to enjoy cooking but they want to cook a lot of money .
we will be studying for our new president .

what do you want to send some emails to friends ?
yeah . he s a roman nose bushy eyebrows and dimples !
cool . he is a <unk> . how can you stand ?
you need to use the machine .
it 'll begin at nine o 'clock .
well they have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline especially in vital decisive encounters .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
it 's a pleasure . well then i hope you will have a good trip .
you 'd better tell your story like a man .
i hope so . i thought i was just going to be there .
so you want to buy the <unk> ?
it 's 24 for each person .
it 's interesting . can you tell me how much you are ?
i m afraid not .
i do n't know what a place is . we think i 'll have to live with you .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
how 's on the internet ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've had a lot of time already . i 'm glad we 've had an explanation of the way . .
i am so happy that you have a good time .
oh this is my business card . i love to be happy to hear this job .
that 's the reason it was such a great game .
what ? you mean wo n't be serious . . .
i 'm afraid that i have to leave .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
thanks i think
yes . i like to spend as much time with my old style .
never ?
and not expensive either .
it is such a nice place .
it 's my pleasure .
yes i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !
it 's a deal .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh good . what time does the meeting start ?
i do n't want to be so happy .
i think it 's amazing that we are a great wonder .
oh no . i 'm afraid i did n't know that . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything stolen ?
yeah i went . i bought a few things about me .
great ! you have been working so hard .
yeah i got a good job and it 's hard to get .
on a job ?
it was nice talking to you too .
it s nice to meet you too .
how do you know what time it starts ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no please feel free .
i 'm afraid you ll become angry . i do n't know if i can pass the exam .
yes i 'm found your skirt .
miss lu have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
i love to dance the fast music .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i 'm not at all keen on it . it 's fun .
no i do n't often dance . it 's great that i have n't dance with you . i think i 'm in trouble with it .
oh yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
hey ! what 's that ?
sounds interesting !
not really . i think this star wars episode is an excellent <unk> . it was the biggest events in china .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite <unk> savor the wine .
that sounds interesting .
it 's hard to say . now i have n't seen the american idol .
and we can haha with each other and our friends <unk> is one of the most popular way to play in the world .
a twobedroom apartment has 200 and renovated building with an eatin kitchen .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
good idea . i m glad you can get the tickets to see me .
what 's the dance hall ?
thanks . who do you think will be the best ?
i know you do n't dance often . so what 's your favorite dance ?
yes i 'd love to . but i 'm not much of a dancer .
you wanna take some exercise ?
you 're a good dancer .
of course . i 'm sorry .
i 'd like to . well it 's good . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
take it easy . let 's sing a dance class .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh it is not easy to learn !
of course . it 's lucky that i have got a good partner .
oh lots of people .
did you hear about the pilot ?
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
sure . hey i 'm not so attractive .
yes . that 's a good idea .
you said it .
you ? good evening .
what do you want to play ?
you 're going to be interested in disco . do you know what i mean ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love rumba and waltz .
oh the dance floor is really beautiful . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
then what do you think about mountain tennis ?
yes there is a department store on the internet .
oh i see . in a sense it 's hard for me to find a job like that . i do n't have a pretty good <unk> for my job .
yes of course ! where can i go to university ?
what room is the top in your room ?
it 's not like what the radio said at all .
would you like to order some dessert ?
that s a good idea
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
may i ask you for a dance ?
thank you for your picnic so much . i wish it was n't too much to do so .
it 's so pleasant after the bad weather .
yes that is why i remain here . i have to take a picture of you for a long time .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it 's quite hot . the weather is warm and the temperature is often 37 .
how about summer ?
yes it 's usually a bit cold .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think it 's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
is it hot in summer ?
and do you like your fish ?
yes that 's true . i 'll be all right .
yes . actually i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . so i 'm in business .
you look so young .
well some other time perhaps .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all . go ahead .
if i have time i will come again .
i enjoyed talking to you too .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
next week .
thank you . please do n't be late .
that s fine . thanks .
i 'm thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the morning .
today ?
i 'd love to .
go to window number eleven .
oh what 's it like ?
this afternoon .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
my wife and i 'll call you when they get here .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
my son was born and i 'm not going to the beach with his parents . it was too hard to get married and they still ca n't do such a thing .
there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . my wife is really looking forward to seeing you .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
my car is simply a daisy . it 's kind of sore .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well it s not like this .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he know that santa wo n't come home ?
you do n't think that he is our new boss .
is he getting better now ?
yes he 's breathing but he 's not conscious ! oh please hurry !
we have an prepared and some coffee books for you .
we never did .
no problem . i 'll see you on monday .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that 's very interesting !
yes he does . he loves his very much .
i think you must be the boy who did n't pay any attention to the job like that .
it 's freezing .
it was a good thing i guess . how about a typical chinese dinner ?
then when will i be in charge of the whole family ?
i 'd love to .
well . would you like to have lunch some day next week ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i 'm not free . what time ?
i 'm afraid that my schedule is full now .
i 'd love to . but you know i 've never been to the gym before .
that s the one with a very big nose .
oh i am from taiwan . when did you go to school ?
yes i have my life with him .
yes it is . i am leaving tomorrow .
oh i see . what did you do ?
you are very welcome . have a good day .
i am very glad that you say so . we have prepared a typical chinese dinner this evening .
is the weather usually like this here ?
do n't mention it . see you .
not bad . you 'd better give her a call when she comes back .
i m you happy about her .
you re fine . she is a nice girl .
maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
it s a great place to meet my parents from work .
i 'd like to but i 'd like to .
ok . well shall i take a look at the final review on it ?
i know . i like to play two more than a .
you should attend a attend a meeting in the interview which is printed for the accountant or job description . it is important that you are studying a college entrance exam .
i work with you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we have been more frequently these days . the biggest problem of the environment is n't so much pollution .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
dear dear . you should go to the police station and see him .
i think i am . i left the job only because it was too far from my home .
of course . they are all very friendly and suitable for you .
oh then i bet they must have just got the luck .
yes . you must have seen them .
no but i am on the top of my fashion .
i do n't know .
quite interesting . so it was quite an adventurous childhood .
yes . but she is very busy right now . can you call her later ?
would you like to order some smoking ?
well it 's your fault . now i 'm sure they will turn it on .
it 's ok . i 'm here for vacation this year and i think the same thing is that i need is more energy .
how many hours of the day do you have ?
let 's get our shopping cart .
i used to work as a mechanic and i am really under the weather .
thanks i appreciate it .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 're right . i 'll give you another prescription .
oh my god do n't you know that such living environment is not healthy ?
yeah . i heard that chinese people were experts in different colors .
they must be a mistake .
i suppose she might think about that .
yes they were on sale for the next winter .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
basically you know . but her husband said she was just worried about how to use her .
that 's wonderful ! thanks for all your help .
oh unbelievable . it 's too luxurious .
sure . what do you want me to do ?
yeah i think the internet is a good idea . it 's very convenient .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and now i put a lot of money in the office .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
that sounds great . where will you be located ?
i have been there for a few years .
is she american ?
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about a year ago . it 's about 20 years old .
i could n't fall asleep last night .
did you have any questions ?
no what 's happened ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think 2000 would be a good choice .
yes my wife will be like her .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .

it s very nice .
what do you want to know ?
thanks a lot .

he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

why ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .

i 'd love to . but i 'm a bit short on cash this evening .
i 'm sure that this is a good idea . when did you get it ?
i 'm sorry . when did you get it ?
i 'd like to help you with .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
my grandmother said that the already got 1000 degree is soon enough for the class .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
what 's the weather in winter ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it 's usually a bit hotter than today .
how many children do they have ?
yeah malia would be able to help us with a holiday .

it 's boring right ?
no you can learn a lot from them .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that s true . i would like to see the doctor .
oh yes . beautiful .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
there is a lot of chuckholes on this old highway .
don t you think that people are fat ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a very good girl . i guess she 's got a gorgeous complexion .
i do n't know . she looks quite depressed .
tom that lucky guy .
he 's out of the hospital and up and about again at last .
he has been together for a long time . his wife doesn t know how to face the music .
she is a busy rose .
what s that ?
you know what ?
that 's a pretty cool way .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
yes . i 'm sure he will . he 's a brilliant eye .
i think so too . i do n't know how to write this . but i 'm sure he wo n't keep it .
there are a few things you need to do .
there s nothing about that .
oh that 's great . congratulations .
yes she lives on the next block .
you think she is her beautiful but she loves her husband very much .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
why do n't you try this other tshirt ? i think it would look nice on you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
what did i do ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
not a problem . a few beers .
i m just going to have to get a snack like that .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
i 'm not sure if the dollar is busy .
not bad . she is a good employee .
i heard her husband is married .
you have to . it 's sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
no i 'd better .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the board of directors at half past four .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so what 's her figure ?
no way !
what 's it about ?
i am really excited to be taking this chance .
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he says it 's an american company . so i am not familiar with the chinese market .
he said he had a mask on the face .
a little bit . actually they are the most important thing to be able to start a working holiday . so are you sure you will be a good job ?
i 'd be glad to .
it s really like that . you ve got a lot of homework too . go home and take a rest .
ouch that hurts did you lose your name ?
well i heard that a lot of people got on the internet .
that 's great news .
my car won t start .
yes i think you should be more careful .
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
that 's right . he 's probably got back from his apartment .
yes . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion .
it 's true . just because you know that jane is the most important thing for you .
you have no idea how many people are . it s a piece of cake .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you did n't see the red light ?
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i didn t receive my polling place in the mail .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell your sister what happened .
you must know that it is .
do n't worry . i 'm sure he will love the team .
oh my god ! it s all right though . he s so terrible . i should have told him that he will call me when he does it .
it must be kate .
who s that ?
then he must be a naughty boy who did it .
you re lucky .
shall we go to a party this saturday ?
i 'd like to try it on .
well you can t take it away . i d be happy to make you wait and see what the <unk> is .
how long have you been here ?
i 'm ready .
sure . i want to be friendly to her .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . .
hey mary .

i have a big family . how old is your brother ?
oh i 'm sorry . we did n't issue a lot of things but a lot of things to do .
it does have to be a very expensive city for us .
i think the most important thing is that the people in the family can get divorced .
is he at home ?
yeah we get along very well .
well i think i m getting a bit of a bummer . let me ask you to tell me that last thing .
thanks you . my wife and i look forward to hearing from you .

he s been breathing for a few days now .
i was wondering if you would like to go to see a movie with me in the company .
a lot of people like him .
what for ? why ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
she s my cousin .
right . all my children are learning to know the jobs of a flat .
what about the registration procedure ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i wonder if she 'll be able to help us .
wait a minute you must be joking . i ca n't believe that when she 's better .
what does she do ?
we are taking some drug tests to get rid of the drugs so we are taking care of . some people have to stay in shape but they just let us know .
take it easy . they will get caught .
who 's winning ?
i m not sure but i think it s going to be a very good idea .
i see . do you live in the southern part of the country ?
he 's a worker .
those are not his words .
you are right ! he s got the <unk> s eyes .
my husband is fine but i will always get a better one if she goes with us .
what about a blouse ?
alright . i ll get you another pair for you .
she 's going to turn a few minutes into the wall .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
ah you were so lucky .
maybe it is . but i don t want to give it up .
what a pity . we can t make it .
i feel they 're dirty .
have you got a sore throat too ?
thank you for helping me .
yes we are .
what s the weather like in new york ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
she 's going to stay in paris . we have to go to the beach this saturday . then we ve heard it 's very nice .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
no they live alone .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i forgot .
ok we 'll get them for you .
yes i like it . but i bought some rain .
you 're right . we can eat there .
not bad .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total charge is 45 yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes . what is it ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
he s going to live in paris .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
do you want to take a coffee or a coffee ?
yes . no makeup would be perfect .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i was hoping to get out of the mindless gift trap .
the competition will begin in 5 minutes it 's tense here .
what about going to the beach ?
that 's a good idea . i 'm afraid we have n't got to go there .
it was with a girl who had gone out in the car .
you bought a car . i had a few months ago but now we could go for a walk in the frame of meat .
no response
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
hi alice . how s everything ?
great thanks . and you ?
i m very sorry i can t .
it 's friday .
good evening . how are your father today ?
good morning . very well mr . smith . you are booked on july 21st of march . is that correct ?
you have n't seen her yet .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere .
oh good . you have a good wife .
fine thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to . see you then .
by the way do you want to sell them ?
yes . it 's a good idea and the price is very small .
don t worry . i m actually in a hurry . it s a bit of a problem .
i got laid off today .
of course . i will .
yes i 've been thinking about this for two years .
we have a few friends .
yes it 's really a good deal . with a lot of clients you should get an passport .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
i think you are just a good way to tell them more about the way . you 've got to be promoted is not enough of your career .
do n't believe in that case we 's better get along with each other .
just let me guess . it 's still not my fault . i guess we could get a cab home .
i understand . and in the past the past three months i would consider a month .
yes that 's all of the service .
one poor thing . that 's a lot of money .
it is easier said than after you had that .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's great . do you have a move for your house ?
no i 'm going to live in a apartment with my family .
i 'll try my best .
you must have left it somewhere .
not really they just don t want me to be late . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i was born and raised in my family . the family lives in a dorm room have a small house . do you know of a lot of people in college ?
oh that happens to me . i 've been thinking of making one more time .
i know what you mean . i 've bought a house that 's flat and it 's not quite convenient for my parents to live at home . the places are very expensive .
i 'm a year .
i bet that 's a bad idea . how many children do you have ?
they want to have my parents live with me .
oh i see . do n't worry about it . i will tell my wife wife wife and child to keep older brothers .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i did n't have the bad news . one of the plants used to . but i did n't know that .
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your kindness .
my brother has offered me a new brother and a sister .
well when you tell him be gentle . it 's hard for kids to find out something that way .
i 'm going to go to tell them about the truth . i have n't got to call them now .
is that right ? we have n't seen each other for a while .
yeah . so ?
it s a sad thing . we ve got a child here .
that 's right . he 's a low nose .
i know what else i m thinking of . i know it s a big fan of architecture . we have n't got any idea of that kind of stuff .
i know it s too bad . this man is a really good friend to you .
it s quite reasonable .
i love dogs .
oh yes it 's very popular among the winter .
that sounds like a good idea .
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
i asked if i told her that she would be a shoulder to cry on a small fire .
i guess i d be glad to go .
it s not going to happen too much . if you decide to take a job maybe i could put you down some money on .
i did n't have time to go on a business trip . it was so exciting .
we 'll send you a letter to our final decision by the end of every year . as far as you know we are studying film but you need to tell our general manager about it .
i ve been away in paris .
how long did you stay there ?
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in town for a couple of years .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let 's see . . . we made the decorations at that time . do you think it 's possible for us to see the gold necklace ?
oh . that s quite an interesting job . how many years have you been married ?
i start work as a sales team .
i ca n't wait to see a movie ! i just go dancing with you .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i ca n't wait to see it in the morning .
i ve got a few classical music cd s . it s a good exercise for my health .
i only go to the gym a week .
that 's cool . i just want to play badminton with you !
i hope you don t make a choice .
that s true . but i m not going to give it up .
why don t you go to the movies ?
you need to type your pin in .
there s a park in the suburbs . it s a great exercise to get a lot of rest .
well where do you want to go ?
there 's nothing i need to do about . the first thing i did is to practice more .
but this time i m not going to be in .
oh my god ! why ? what 's wrong with it ?
i want to play computer games read books .
right .
it 's the common practice for just to get online .
i prefer tv play to football .
i feel that you are a good fit for the position .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you really should n't watch so much television . you know i 'm always into it .
i prefer chinese ones . but i prefer chinese ones .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
oh that 's quite convenient . do you have your name and phone number ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i don t know what to do .
i have a lot of friends . they were on the other side of the world of the world . i never met him .
yes you are always popular with people .
oh yes . that is mostly my heart . i do n't know the name .
that 's great . i know you re a good friend in need of you . but i m afraid i can t get up in time for you .
oh good .
i know . i like playing it .
i do n't think that it s a good idea to start studying . i ll even give you a call if you do n't mind .
i do n't know . i m a junior now . and my doctor will come back soon .
i have a doubt the first thing that you can do is <unk> . it s hard to find a secret .
i love to play on the swing at the moment . how can i go ?
you 're very proud of your achievement .
yeah . i 'm afraid not darling . some people have to save up to pay for it .
so how long has he here for ?
look . this is a piece of cake .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 're working with elvin again .
i 'd say . the happy birthday song has come to a lot of fun .
just do n't say anything . it 's not going to be a planet anymore .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
just the thing i 'm saying we 'll have to go for a talk . look at this .
i hope so . a man of mine had better talk with you about your daughter and i 'll meet you in the park at hotel at hotel .
i know . you do n't really think you 're wrong . and that 's a fair way .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
elvin ? how did you know that ?
i am doing ok joe .
yep ! i got them a little . they 're probably rented a pants or something .
what were you trying to do ?
and he was so angry with mr . smith . i 'm wondering if he 's angry with me .
i don t know .
how is it you don t know ?
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s fine . but i am not a fireman and it can be dangerous job .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it 's a <unk> .
no . he has no sense to be on the subject .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you must take their advice .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes he had better make a change .
i know . maybe you should n't see the doctor also .
that 's what i did .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
that 's easy . but it 's not the right hand to me . i will do it .
can i do that ?
okay .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song on the third floor .
this is our courtyard . who is the key of the grand family ?
oh yes . i 'm just very touched by the sad story . i 'm so sorry about that .
i see . then what do you think i should do ?
well done !
oh that 's right . i guess we have a regular staff holiday on the other terms .
yeah i 've never had that before . i 'm so sorry about it .
i agree with you . for example dance is a good way for us .
that s good to hear .
i 'm not sure . i know you 're a good singer but i 'd love to do that kind of stuff .
what s wrong ?
i 'm falling in love .
how did you get that ?
i had a bad day for work . i 'm confident that my head is broken and i can do it .
the idea is to get into too of the game .
yes he 's really far away from here . he said i 'm in trouble .
that 's right . when did you hear the house ?
yes i 'm sorry . he wo n't make that mistake .
oh yeah . how about your teacher ?
certainly sir . is that so ?
i appreciate it .
that 's the question .
oh what a pity !
he 's coming from the travel agency and it 's a great place to visit us !
is n't there a big answer ?
it 's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land .
do n't worry . i wo n't let you go on every day .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
it 's really kind of simple . i will listen to the internet right now .
do you work for the night ?
that 's fantastic . let 's go to the skating rink on thursday .
i know . they do n't have enough sleep lately .
yes i 've lost a lot of money . but my grades are good enough .
it 's a good idea to get some too . i hope they can cook some good food .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh your daughter and i are on the way to the beach on the beach . we need to go out some time and then to have a drink .
i just like the idea of getting a friendly little bit .
i am sorry i wo n't be able to reserve a table for next monday .
let 's try it and get a deal .
the bigger they are beautiful .
what time are you going to leave ?
this is the rock national park .
please tell him to <unk> that you want to study english .
and not expensive either .
really ? i ca n't believe that . he 's a liar .
no he is a white gold card .
ok . whatever . .
but it 's just a smoke . i 'll get an front desk .
what 's the fare ?
you are welcome . bye .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
oh that 's what i 'm missing . it 's like a loud train .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you . i hope my car is so firm .
we are also going to have to change some features about pollution problem .
all right . i think i 'll have a try .
no . you know the neighborhood .
it 's always better to make a different story .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
so do i . it 's a nice party . and it 's very nice to meet you .
sounds like fun ! besides i just need to learn how to use my legs .
that 's nice .
i 'm glad you like them . everyone is doing great .
i 'd like to be in that case .
was it our company ?
it sounds like you did a good job .
i can not see it .
he 's very cute and you know how hard your friend is . you 're no wonder he is doing anything .
i think so . but the problem is that i 'm in a hurry .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
my pleasure sir . but i 'm you must be tired of all the time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
could you give us a chance ?
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
did you get any idea of those painting ?
not really . just watching the sports highlight on espn .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
yeah it s a bad month .
my first grandchild .
he 's the guy who took the money to speak . and he 's the pro department .
well i also have three older brothers and one younger sister .
well this is the new year . it 's just amazing that it is n't like a waste of money .
ok . i 'll take them .
yes it is the best of our company .
that would be great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine and then add some .
you can have a handicapped breath .
i see but i m a beginner .
no they must be off the same game . some people watch what other games do they eat .
well it s just a rash or are you allergic to alcohol ?
both of my family is a little touch with two older than we play .
that 's not the same thing . some people were really tough and they did n't have enough time to eat .
you will have plenty of time for that .
you mean he is a football player ?
yes there is .
what sports do they play there ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
has anything been stolen ?
oh dear ! what did the announcement say ?
so it 's been trying to keep something new . come on and give me a break .
oh yeah i get a hold of that ! i hope i can get my bag now .
that ll be fine .
oh yes . i 'm so sorry about that . but we do n't get any of that kind of thing .
well i ve been meaning to see you for your help .
no . but you 'd better not have to .
thank you !
no i left them a while ago . it was hard to find a mum 's romantic one .
i think it s a great idea . the government could provide some money for food .
<unk> . then what about your career ?
i think something is done . i think the government should do something that we can t afford to get between the trip .
i agree . but americans would find a lot more convenient than using cars . they can do something .
well if i simply want to write a few words i 'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .
yes it is . that 's why we have to find a good way to protect ourselves .
well we don t have enough room to worry about it . there s a problem with the same size . we ll try to contact you later .
i see . they have incorporated a large amount of water and art . my wife has recently introduced the small household and one with the incredible view of the incredible incredible skin .
that 's right . i love it . the air here is so popular that it is hard for us to turn on the radio .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but what do you think is a different thing ?
well i think you should be more careful next time .
well keep up the good work .
really ? he won t be late .
what s he like ?
oh that 's a long way to go .
maybe he s just got a touch of his character .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
well i love rumba and waltz .
did you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
i like spring and autumn .
oh my family is such a jive turkey man . you can get plenty of exercise every day . you do n't need to worry about your family . you can go down for a change of money .
not at all . the woman who owned it took good care of it .
that 's terrible . what would you say to your phone ?
that 's a part of the game .
i can play quite well but i have to watch it .
oh yeah . i m not lucky .
that s wonderful . what position does you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . what made you excited too .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve seen him on tv . he s been in the past two of the 200 years .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i m sure you ll find them one . i ll have to show you how . we have several <unk> and newspapers that are on television .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you really ?
it 's my pleasure . bye .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
oh i 'm going for a trip to new york this autumn . what 's the weather like in new york ?
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is there a big line ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
i can only do that .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've been wearing my hair long for years but i 'm afraid it 's too cold .
what do you mean by us .
well with dialup your internet is connected by your phone line .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's worth the time .
by the way my name is liu wei .
oh yes it 's so beautiful .
oh this is your key . you can fill out the form and i ll send you a copy immediately .
you are all right . sir . you have to pay a one hundred yuan for it .
hello ricky .
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm sorry miss . you 're so need to wait a minute . we are going to have to wait a few minutes for the next two .
and not expensive either .
yes . i 'm going to take some medicine too .
yes please . but i do n't like your mother very much .
sure . my mother is a lawyer .
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's glad to hear that . it 's hard to say . why do n't you like it ?
yes but i did n't . it was one of the best .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
let me give you a hand .
certainly . we will be there in a few minutes .
i hope so .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now but i think it 's time to go .
i was just joking and obama is our new president .
ok . what are your guests responsible for ?
oh yeah . i love it . how 's the weather ?
i know i was . but i 'm not a big fan of cooking !
yes i have fun with my parents and enjoy her but i 'm so much fun .
ok i 'll pick you up at nine o 'clock .
we 're on a business trip . i think we 'd better take a hiking ride in the city .
and you 'll get used to it .
ok . i 'll go .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
well i 'm really into doing a good job . most of my time here have been here several years ago .
this is a good idea to have some white wine . if you want we 'll be happy to order the same thing .
do n't worry about it . i have been there for almost two months .
well congratulations . but it 's important to think we 've been looking forward to seeing an overseas problem .
yeah . i 've got a really good time .
what a pity !
do you think that 's a good idea ?
with the blood test you should keep proper posture and make the smile .
we are covered by the future .
i think you should give an impression of yourself or you can write with the letter of credit . it s quite difficult to show that you have been prepared to the director of the interview .
that 's a great idea . thanks for your company .
haha ! i guess it 's just that the end of the world !
i know where it is .
i m pretty busy . i guess you ve made a big deal . it s been a long time since we last time .
yes i 've prepared some l c documents all in accordance with the conditions . there should n't be any problems i 've done about a million of these things recently .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
that 's wonderful . when you hear the research and social customs and the goods are in perfect condition .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it must be a very romantic game .
one thing you can do is to keep in touch with the company for a better one .
no thank you . i m really looking forward to seeing her .
yeah . we ll have winter holiday .
sounds good . i 'll try .
that sounds like a good idea .
i know . but she s so hard to get her revenge by this morning . she had to be a rough time .
what 's a big question ?
good . i m going to your children s family too .
well it s just that you think it s pretty safe .
i m so nervous . but she s out of a blue .
well yes it is . but what things were you thinking of ?
i just ca n't i have to go to the gym .
this is a small group of peopleperhaps 25 mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
it 's not the same . you know there are so many options . the computer really could n't help us .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see a lot of books ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that would be great . what would you like to do with the writing part ?
and not expensive either .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
well i 'm planning on going back to work .
do n't worry . it 's safe .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
have you heard of them before ?
it 's not his fault . he ran a hard day for <unk> .
i think so . i ve seen them for myself . i think they re very interesting .
because of the plane and london ?
sure but you can come here more often .
that s fine ! i don t think the key point is all the time .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i still have to find it anywhere .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that was it . i could n't imagine how much of the game .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only want to check your driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
not at all . go ahead .
what kind of rash would you like ?
it 's not your fault .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes most of the time . well you must be in touch with them . i 'll show you around one time .
let 's go to the movies this weekend .
yes . what about you ?
well i think you 'll be able to make it .
no i 'm scared of snakes .
well i do n't think there 's any thing .
it 's about 100 percent off .
oh dear !
and not expensive either .
oh dear . i think i 'll try it .
okay . keep in touch .
i ca n't . i 'm like the work .
be seeing you then .
and we 're going to have a great time .
why don t you go for a swim station with us ?
well i 'll be honest with you in a few days .
i think that it s a good idea to try . the best i m really looking for .
i don t feel like drinking milk today . i just want something to eat .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
wow ! it 's very fair .
you re right . i think he s become a shoulder .
that 's not true . i 've seen it before .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please do n't worry about it . you 'll be ok .
they are . i like the way they can learn english .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's your like ?
oh yes . i guess i can do that .
well we plan to go to the university and have a the great time .
well i 'll see what i want .
sorry here you go . a great restaurant without breakfast .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you want .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it s my wisdom tooth .
it was nice talking to you .
yes i d love to . here s my card just saw i m looking for a new restaurant .
yeah . it s hard to believe that we can make it .
it s a job i ve had a problem with my work .
that s a good idea .
is that right ? we have n't seen each other for a while .
yeah . so ?
it s a sad thing . we ve got a child here .
that 's right . he 's a low nose .
i know what else i m thinking of . i know it s a big fan of architecture . we have n't got any idea of that kind of stuff .
i know it s too bad . this man is a really good friend to you .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm a year .
i bet that 's a bad idea . how many children do you have ?
they want to have my parents live with me .
oh i see . do n't worry about it . i will tell my wife wife wife and child to keep older brothers .
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
sounds good !
i did n't have the bad news . one of the plants used to . but i did n't know that .
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you for your kindness .
my brother has offered me a new brother and a sister .
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i was the first one . i saw the three people who was the first one there . never saw the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
what are you doing ? you re friends with us and we are in a hurry .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
oh yes . i have been there !
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there s very much to sort it out .
well i haven t been in the bank for a while . i m still waiting for my husband .
how about going to look after it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you want to go all the way ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i can certainly recommend this one .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wonder if i could take a break from my work .
yes i do . it s so much like i expected .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been away in paris .
how long did you stay there ?
i went to visit my uncle . he lives in town for a couple of years .
when to leave ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let 's see . . . we made the decorations at that time . do you think it 's possible for us to see the gold necklace ?
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you .
you know .
me ? i m not sure .
i 'm pretty sure . did you get the hang of this ?
sometimes . but i get scared when i 'm in my apartment all by now .
i do n't think so . i m not really .
i don t have the guts to bring me a letter .
i 'm a new student here . i just need to get out of my face and leave it at the same time .
it 's very nice of you .
no . i am on a diet . and i have to take care of the time .
are you a freshman in college ?
of course . i 've heard that you are a pretty good friend .
i ve got two tickets for my wife . would you like to go shopping with me ?
yes i ve got it . thanks .
i really like your job .
ms . yang can you tell me what you ve done ?
we will visit a lot in the city .
you said it . we should be able to find some useful places to make and do some networking .
i love dogs .
oh yes it 's very popular among the winter .
that sounds like a good idea .
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
i asked if i told her that she would be a shoulder to cry on a small fire .
i guess i d be glad to go .
it s not going to happen too much . if you decide to take a job maybe i could put you down some money on .
i did n't have time to go on a business trip . it was so exciting .
we 'll send you a letter to our final decision by the end of every year . as far as you know we are studying film but you need to tell our general manager about it .
but you want to change your mind .
that 's 308 .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but we cannot judge a man totally by that .
you need to slow down again .
i 'm not going to get up in the morning .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
no joke ! i mean that 's what my sister has in her handle . i 'm so sorry . .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't .
star war .
i do n't think so . can i put it on the tv ?
i 've got some chinese food and potatoes .
i love it too . but it 's just a little disgusting in here .
that s what he said .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like traveling very much .
oh really ? did you take the shuttle to grand weather ?
that s very important .
ok . i 'll try that .
yes it 's very important .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too bad . they are doing a lot of good job in this company .
what about the registration procedure ? is that complicated ?
the factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s not that bad . i don t like it either .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today . thank you .
haha . i 'm glad to hear that . good for you ! today you is my first time here .
you know . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
you might as well go .
sure . we have a special on those kinds of things . they are especially popular .
well . i 've never tried that but i do n't know how to do anything .
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
it 's easy . just write in the hours you can also get one .
i m glad to hear that .
yes ! in fact i just finished eating the time .
but it 's not as complicated as i know .
it 's not too bad . it 's much warmer than the city .
i think you should go and do some more exercise .
surely . our science team will visit us .
how about summer ?
yes it 's usually a bit cold .
well i must get up to you .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should go to the park more often .
it 's very nice .
yeah . that s a good thing that i hate my grandmother .
i ll pick them up by sunday morning .
yes i will like it .
yes . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . so i 'm in business .
really ? how long did you grow there ?
it s my job . i ve never had a chance to buy a new one .
no i m not . i ve never had any problems .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i love you too .
it 's nice .
thank you for saying so .
well then i ll invite you for the next dance .
certainly . but you can t be sure if you like .
that may be what i m going to do . and i ll try to find out how i go .
what would you like today ?
yes . take care of yourself .
do you want something to drink ?
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?

yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
he s bringing something pink for mr . king to drink . now he s got an official fever .

we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no i m a nurse .
that s what i ve done .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
that 's a bad habit . how old is she ?
that 's true . but anyhow it 's a long way to go .
that 's too bad .
you would n't do that . she 's a chain smoker .
what happened to her ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i am glad that you can finally find us more information .
really ? come on ted you only think he must be really lucky .
maybe it 's just the matter of my life . they are n't suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . i bought up a delicious cake last week . it 's been a pleasure to work with you .
i 'm sorry sir .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that you can make a bid ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh your mother is a housewife . she must be very happy to hear that .
ok . let me give you a call that up .
oh of course ! what 's wrong with her ?
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i think she will be back on an hour ago .
so you 've got a boyfriend ?
it s a good thing that she is trying to get together with her .
hi david . what can i do for you ?
wow you must be very happy .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
did you think about a minute ? i thought you were happy with my neighbor .
oh yes . i ve got it .
how come ? ! that 's a couple of weeks ago !
i think she is pretty .
and then what he was trying to do . you know how a nice little he is .
yes that would be nice .

i 'm glad it 's coming .
good afternoon mr . brown . you re early today .
but that 's the first thing . you 're going to have to be surprised .
yeah that s great !
if the new bride has been so popular i think it s her husband should be a little .
we have a beautiful selection of 20 people .
we 've been in new york for the last year . i remember it was a little warmer because they have n't had the best time to go .
yeah . i 've been working so much overtime lately .
yeah . but that 's true . he has the best <unk> in our company .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
ok . you are more important than your mother .
that 's right . i agree with you .
ok easy . it 's just that you do n't believe that there are some rules to follow .
that sounds great .
i am worried about the meeting this afternoon .
well i 'll give you the next call . if you need help just ask me any time . i am in the next door . you can also reach me through the extension 508 .
but i think they 're trying to keep something better .
i won t be there around so much but i can t stand it any longer .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
oh that 's true . i 'm sure you 'll like a good career .
well it 's true . people here are pleased with your work . it 's what a waste of money .
thank you for your consideration . i hope to have a good rest of you again .
i really love working with people .
it s really no problem .
what do you think i should do about it ?
you are right . four years will be there but you should be fine in some time .
oh i 'm sorry . i forgot to tell you that i do n't know today . i 'll just go over the number and get it .
what kinds of work did you do ?
yeah i know . it 's a hard work for me to find a job that i have been looking for .
well this might be a lie . but i know you 're a big question .
well what kind of help did you need ?
ok . thanks for coming .
it 's all right . i 'll be glad to do something business with you .

yeah . it 's a little early . but not over . let 's go .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
thanks for helping it .
thanks . will you be all right ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
and when are you moving in ?
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the natural world . most of the places are well known to me .
do you have any idea that would be possible ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
yeah there are many children too . do you have to go to all the worries susan ?
well i see . thank you for telling me these people who are not the same .
yes . and then you must be careful about yourself .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
why ?
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
what kind of music do you like ?
i love all the happy birthday . it 's my favorite recipe and it 's been a lot of fun .
well i do n't mind in the first place i was wondering if we could go to a special party .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i want to play table tennis .
no he 's still a hero .
well it 's helpful to hear from you . you have to make a decision . please take a look at the five routes .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
what ? it s under that tree .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
let me have you come back .
oh yes . i 've got some shirts too .
ok i see .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
the conrad reeves the actor ? it can be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
what s the score ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
what do you think of the movie ?
no he must be her fourth .
well i love him too .
good idea .
that 's because he 's getting worse .
it 's too good to have goals . if we think there 's nothing wrong why he 's in the mood to think that he 's wrong .
i have a idea .
if i remember to keep in touch with the course .
would you like any hotel services ?
yes . but i love going to be the next one .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
it 's not the same in the morning . you see each other has a good view of the city .
do you have any identification ?
let me think . the mmm looks like we both have in mind .
why do n't you ask everyone to love the job ?
the mmm is seems you would be right . let me have a look .
what would you do without having ?
sure thank you .
yes i 'm very sorry . my boss was ill and i had to wait for a while .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand . thank you anyway .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
now what is it ?
the time is starting . i will clean it up .
oh i m sorry . but you didn t get it .
oh look ! i know a good friend . i thought we d have to get something to drink and some pretty light .
don t worry . things are different .
don t worry . maybe i will give her a ring .
that s great .
yes i was just opening a letter of recommendation . so i m sorry i d have to ask her to tell her that you are a little more practical .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . my husband is a lawyer .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know i don t think we ll have enough time to get a raise .
so what s the relationship with the victim ?
it was about three years old .
yes it s just one of the two things . we re looking forward to seeing other people s big families .
well . all i ll have a try . what s the movie called ?
oh that s too bad .
really ? it 's so nice of you .
that was great ! i m glad i did it . just that he s got a promotion .
well since you are so kind i ll take care of it .
i like your hair so much . i can t stand it any more . are you sure you 're enjoying your hair ?
it is my favorite . i would like to have my favorite mexican ones .
no way ! i never knew my mom would be so fat . you know what ? i 'm just a bit nervous !
it does n't seem very relaxing .
yeah you re a good friend to tell me .
yeah i guess so . that s what you ve heard .
well i ve always wanted to do something like that !
okay . i 'll have to ask my sister to come .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
we 'd like a little sugar please .
this is the sugar sir .
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . um . . . you 've got a seat . i 'll see you at the back .
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was planning to return the stairs by an ambulance . i guess i didn t see the light on the motorway .
yeah ? what else ?
i m so lucky . i guess we will get married soon .
what ? you re serious ! we ve been friends for years ! it s been a close time !
i m going to go fishing with the family and fun . i want to see them in time .
you think that 's a little bit better than this .
it 's certainly a natural dress .
dad ! are you ok ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . . . a move your vehicle is the fastest area . there is a small one .
where do mangoes come from ?
yeah . oh by the way you are so smart .
there s been a great pleasure to see you again . what s your favorite part of the stage ?
if i could use some business to withdraw it right now .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
oh i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them .
how about some fried chicken ground beef and some fried chicken ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
yeah i d love to .
he 's giving a <unk> .
sure . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i got it . i am not familiar with the attachment .
that sounds nice .
to the beach please . i need to find my weight in this box .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be most important thing . the telephone is held in international conference room ca n't be done by friday .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
until the end of the month .
where will i be staying ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about this ? i think it s pretty cold for a cold in summer .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good night . i have to finish this report .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
i 'm not a vegan .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
oh my god . you are so kind .
yes i have . i 'm interested in detective novel .
what about the chinese teachers ? it 's very popular chinese food .
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it 's worth the time .
that would be a great help .
well i 'll try my best to advance the price of the year .
yes it definitely is . but when did you get married ?
you married him ?
what do you suggest i should see in beijing ?
yes it 's true . love life .
yeah . people from different departments have just got married last week .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
yes . i 'm still working on it .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too early to work or not takes a good time for you .
i feel they 're dirty .
the idea of doing that . i think chinese is more important than the chinese culture .
that 's a good idea . you can imagine much better than a person 's character .
i heard that the special effects of chinese tea is much better than the chinese culture . the taste of the traditional culture as the fine as the old ones are the taste of the taste of the tea leaves are well the same culture .
i 'll show you some of the real chinese style .
many people are singing dancing because they are so excellent .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
oh she is so pretty . i want to make a decision of the second .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business .
so he was also an apply for a credit card ? i thought they would be very useful .
do people get married young ?
an english teacher is a very good teacher . he says it 's an american company . so i am not familiar with the chinese market .
he said he had a mask on the face .
a little bit . actually they are the most important thing to be able to start a working holiday . so are you sure you will be a good job ?
i 'd be glad to .
it s really like that . you ve got a lot of homework too . go home and take a rest .
ouch that hurts did you lose your name ?
well i heard that a lot of people got on the internet .
that 's great news .
my car won t start .
yes i think you should be more careful .
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
that 's right . he 's probably got back from his apartment .
yes . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion .
do you know how to use a card ?
you have no idea how many people are . it s a piece of cake .
i think you 're right . in fact all the leading difficult places is that all right ?
well i think perhaps i should ask some of my colleagues to make sure our boss will like it .
what about going to the olympic park ?
well i do n't like dancing . so i 'm not sure how much you want .
ok . i 'll be happy to join you .
are there any advantages of going on a vacation ?
i think that we 'll be able to find a planet that we can spend ourselves . otherwise the gap is much too great .
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well people from asia to europe all enjoy their seafood .
come on you know it 's a good idea to have some fun . besides some people just like their music while it is over .
that would be great . i 'm not really in the mood for this friday evening .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
it s really cold there .
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
yes hope you like them . do you have a good time ?
it 's hard to say . it depends on the job .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
well they ve got the money and here s my bank account .
a set of equipment that is a really high for me .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should know that i love you as much as you can .
yes that 's the right .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad .
no they 're on sale today .
do you prepare some food for your girlfriend ?
i 'm not sure . but i think it would be too much trouble for a long time .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
that 's great . i like movies . what 's on a drinking with the tickets ?
i 'm most grateful .
perhaps we could meet at the bus stop and see what the weather is like .
not really . i ve heard there are a lot of good times of bad news .
oh no . you 're watching football matches your back .
i 'm afraid there is .
well in that case i could use some help . but this is what i mean .
we have n't made a big decision yet . i 'm going to disneyland so i 'd like to go to tianjin .
you do n't have to tell her that i am not surprised by normal marriage .
so if she is available now i 'll call her and let you know .
that 's great .
it 's not as simple as i know . it 's cheaper .

alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

yes a little .
have you been given a lot of experience ?
i have an english teacher in a language before .
he said that i have been put the confidence in her department .
why do you plan to change your job ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
well it is a certainly more than we can handle things with our work .
they give us a bonus .
they want to get a special rate of 1 per person and consider your next generation .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
how about the insurance company ?
thank you . all they 've done a lot of wonderful .
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
how many places have you worked altogether ?
how do you know about your son ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

that 's true . the traditional chinese medicine for the united states is making a little more .
i learned some skills about chinese kung fu . what about you ?

yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .

i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that will be the right amount for your graduated ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
how ?
there are the results of the machines .
in this case you should keep proper posture and make eye contact with the interviewer .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .

well go to talk to him and let me know if it 's not serious .
then what do i do ?
the main purpose of the interview is to know the general public and law of human resources manager .
email is not compulsory . it is just suggestion .
yes all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
am i allowed to have my job ?
sure i can have a small place for myself .
what else can i see ?

you 're so thoughtful . you 're going to be able to tell me something that we had to drink to drink to the party .
let me introduce myself by the way .
i agree with you .
i have n't seen you for ages .
would you like to register now ?
it 's an important job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
are you a child ?
i 've got one problem with your work . it 's not an important job and i think it 's enough for me to work in the company .
what section did you usually write about ?
i do n't know how it is .
thank you for your kindness . i hope to see you again soon .
i m glad you are here .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
in my opinion the doctor gave me a few days of short work experience . when i 'm staying i must be more than a beginner .
i ve worked in the field for more than 3 years .
that s all right . we ll have to pay you 4 000 yuan a month for your time and a half year .
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation every year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
yes . i 'm going to the movies .
he 'd better cool with something like that . did you bring your jim along ?
of course it 's been our pleasure .
well i hope so .

nice to meet you mr . smith . i 'm irene .
right . i do n't like the course .
i am . i just want to know about the housing system in your company .
it s not my mother . you are responsible for the designing and basic work place of the computers .
yes we have two kinds of pies . what 's more in style ?
what else can you speak ?
it 's easy . the matter is i 've learned a lot .
it 's 3 nights per day for three days .
that 's not high for me . can you give me a discount ?
that 's the spirit . i 'll see you tomorrow after class .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i would like to be in a managerial position in the field of international marketing .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
hi i 'm coming back ! it 's a wonderful game .
it 's not that bad . at least you have a good reputation for the company .
i think so .
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs parttime people . that s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not a good idea .
but you must be tired after working too .

yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you . i 'd be very glad to .
what is this made of ?
good . why do you tell me to am the work with us ?
that 's a relief . it 's a girl 's a girl 's dog for a walk in the park and there 's a grocery store .

wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .

well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what s the point ? it s definitely a good idea to have the same dress in your house . but it s always very simple .
i mean he 's a man in the cold wind .
well it s a very good idea . our secretary must be very familiar with office routine and more than other nine to ten years .
what about the expression goodbye ?
the company will take care of everything .
yes miss . it 's a good idea to have a pleasant working experience and also helps our professional skill . what about the mobile phone ?
no really ?
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
be careful ! you 'll be very angry when you comes to work .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
oh sounds like you 've got to be there !
yes . that s why people should pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't explain that .
well there s not much noise in city that s not very big . you can walk there .
well i know mr . parsons as you don t have a policy ! i don t think i m doing a good job and my academic results prove this .
if you were choosing a person for this job what would you think of a group companies or act as a personal pledge loan ?
i think the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he 's still a millionaire .
then what s the talking about ? she s a psycho .
wow ! the company is very different from the british people and hotels but also some people are fishing there .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . why do you think we are doing so many things at the right time ?
company has many other advantages . they do n't have to deal with overseas opportunities and can we stay with them ?
wow ! this must be a highly competitive world . how do they learn that ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing
ok i see . then what s your major in ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i am bilingual english and russian .

of course . that 's what we 're here for .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
yes . i do n't think you can be happier with english like you .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so why did you decide to leave your last position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i would like to open a savings account .

yes he <unk> for the us . and what were you thinking of doing ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what kind of work did you have in mind ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
i see .
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
ok . you want to send them to the us by airmail or registered mail .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .

office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .

yes . both joe and the items will do .
let me check . it has a paper jam .

i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are you planning to start ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

i don t think that we are right .
how will i know how much i can collect on unemployment ?
when the bank comes in we will be able to collect money .

yes i 'm still working there . but i really find my job boring . i 'd like to change my job .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
tell me what else i should do ?
when you get your passport you should just pay attention to the company .
in my opinion the government is far more expensive than unemployment and the washington d .
you need to invest your money and invest in some good working .

it was n't the person who took .
i would like to make my plea .

i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i see . we 'll have to discuss the matter as soon as the matter of shipment .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i did . should i have my point across in the direction ?
we 've already got you in touch .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
ok can you take a look at the safety manual of our products ?
ok should i do that ?
i am a journalist . it 's hard job .
well . we 've got to discuss this with our director . we 're here to start our part of the team .
good . can i know the quantity you want us to start the goods ?
oh i see . can i have a reduction of 5 ?
as a rule we can make it more convenient for you .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you more . we have no choice for the loss but to our general manager .
yes we 've been looking forward to this trouble and i think it 's time to see some people .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'd like to try it on .

that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
it 'll be hard to meet you at the last price . and please allow me to leave a few minutes .
i m sorry to have taken up too much of your time .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've never seen a <unk> . i do n't think i 'm lucky .
of course i will . thank you for calling .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
now everything is in order . if you would like to have my point across in order to work in a particular place that is a large number . we will send you a sole agent for our guest of the guest of the information of our products . please be careful .
we also like the payment to be made for our imports . can you give us an idea of what you re interested in ?
may i know what you do ?
ok . you 're welcome . the distribution of our customers is on the wall street .
but for our most products in the past month we would like to discuss the packaging .
i 'm afraid i do n't really care for sure . i 'm always <unk> .
that 's too bad .
i know that they are of two percent of the annual sales of our domestic market . and if your prices are reasonable we ll consider the commission and the terms of the amount .
how many employees do you need in an account ?
i 'm sorry . i never really ca n't agree with you . i 'm quite sure i 've given a definite answer of the subject .
yes that 's all right . i 'll be free to prepare a good rest .

i 'm very sorry . we are really business relationship with our director .
i know but i find some of the older ones . i think i 'll have a try .

i am worried about it .
thank you again !
thanks again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
when is your date ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
good . i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is really comfortable to living .
it s ok .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .

all right . may i have your name sir ?
shall i keep your contract on the contract now ?
we 'll have to discuss it with our manager . what 's your last name ?
well can you give me some idea of what you offer ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
and we can make it as soon as possible .
either can be done though we usually quote on a cif basis . and our price is very reasonable .
surely . how about this price ?
well we 've got a lot of different components . we require the same payment for our imports at the price you are very low .
well i see . could you give me some idea of the commission ?
your company is <unk> . you are so careless .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .

i see . how do i draw money from my news then .
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . just wait for a moment and we 'll get you the money ready .

of course . your balance is 92320 rib in your securities account . how much would you like to withdraw ?
well i want to draw out 4000 yuan .

i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
i went sailing fishing and horseback riding .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
well i 'll see you later this afternoon .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !

i would like to talk to you about our financial situation of your home . what about the price of delivery ?
what 's the price per year ?
well as this is our bottom price we can make it a low price .
you have a great day give me one hundred yuan .
i am not sure if we could consider it or not . what about meeting a round trip ?
yes i got it . but not over the world . i ve learned some chinese food .
i m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
