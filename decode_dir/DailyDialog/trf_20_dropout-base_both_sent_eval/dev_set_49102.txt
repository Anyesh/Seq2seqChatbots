all right . i 'll get a taxi and come back .
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
i want it to be the same as the one .
you re not going to be able to fall asleep while you are here .
how long will it take to get there ?
oh look ! there 's an open book that is on the floor .

and do n't forget to bring your umbrella .

i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
you re welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
how often is the bus ?
it depends on the weight of the manual .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
i want to get a ticket .
for color prints ?
i do n't need to leave until the very end of the week .

what about the chicken ?
that 's great . the pictures will <unk> the performance of our products . it 's really a general team player . the question is what you are doing in good shape .
dad i do n't know what to do after it .

what 're you talking about ? my alarm even has n't gone off yet .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
who 's winning ?
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !
cheers .
are you sure they 're healthy ?
yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i 'll have to go and get some food .
yes we have single rooms available in the 6th and 7th floor in the back of the hotel .

i 'll look in the travel guide .
yes i 'd like to buy a cell phone .
would you please help me with the luggage ?
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?

yes . shall i help you ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat .
and have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
sorry i have n't .
that 's what i want .
all right . i 'm ready for you .
hi .
well you should have gotten rid of the rent because it s still a big problem .
i have booked a table for you .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
oh i need to do that .
i think that we ll both have to pay a new one .
i thought it would be possible to get a bad idea .
sorry sir . you can only pay in cash or credit card .
and how long will it take for you to be back in a couple of days ?
yes there is a room with a bath .
can i have my 200 please ?
i want to buy a ticket for my daughter .
no . this is an advantage of its quality and style . you can only try to make you happy the advantage of it .
i 'm glad to hear that .

could i have a look at it please ?
ok . we offer 2 types of saving systems time deposit a time deposit and a one order of ten different kinds .
sorry i have n't .
that 's what i want .
well that 's just a few minutes walk to my office come around and see me now .

how about an outlet ?
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
oh you are not a child . what 's your name ?

i need to see a piece of paper that i 'll do the same for you .
what about a person who gets his name ?
what 's that ? i mean if i 've got enough money and my credit card number is low and i 'm willing to work with you .
i understand .
i think it s time for you to move on for another day .
ok . thank you .

i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that 'd be great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
i 'm not sure yet . i have my new car .
i think you 'll be happy with it . it 's a very good unit . very reliable . i 'll go get you a new one in a box .
i 'll get it . she 's probably going to take her advice . she 's probably going to go shopping with me . i know she 's so busy .
get the hell out of here . um i 'll go get the hospital . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .

i really want to go home and make far too .
it is unnecessary .

what 's that ?
i do n't think so . you can get a good price and a half .
do n't worry . i will tell you when we get there .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .

what do i do with it ?
many times . when i first came to the states i visited the year . when i was a child .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .

it 's my pleasure . if you have any questions you can get a salary .
no . i 've had enough . i 'm in the early thirties and the steak is a little sick .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

oh dear . thanks .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
i think i might need some more help .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
oh that 's a good idea .
i do n't know .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . why ? we 're not in luck !
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
well i bought it from one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i 'm kind of nervous . i could n't get it cheaper somewhere else .
well i guess you can change the subject .
i do n't know .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
this is true . i can see what the problem is .
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . you can just change it .
it 's very easy . some of them are even appear at the beginning of the party .
oh that 's very nice .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .

i didn t say i d already decided dad . i said it was for me to decide . there is a difference .
oh i see . so you can just do whatever you want do you ?
i didn t say that either . i was hoping we could discuss the matter together . i want your advice but i don t want you to tell me what to do . i ve got to make decisions for myself dad .

well i do n't think the quality is the right way .
it 's so beautiful that the girl is able to make things perfect .

a little bit . i 'll have to try my best .
what ? you 're kidding ! i just lost one hour ago !
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
yes i think it 's a good idea .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe you can buy some clothes .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
well i 'll take the two .
it 's a bit red but it 's kind of expensive .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting a bit in the store .
you can do that . the market is a little old .
here is a gift for you . i hope you like it .
is that a good idea ?
i 'll be back in a sec .

will that be all sir ?
we can do it tomorrow just call me .
yes it 's quite all .
can you send someone to fix it today ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .
can you get a mangoes on sale ?
it 's a fruit .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
well it 's a sale price . those are a little expensive on the market .
a dozen will be fine .
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
how long will it take ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
it 's a shop in the store .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . but the some is where you 'll find it .
no . i 'm sure i know .

no i do n't like them . i think i 'll go to the movies .
no they are n't . but they are in a different ways .
where do they grow up ?
i 'll take some too .
most of them are from america .
well we just got in some mangoes .

no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?

that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high . what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !

very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
yes i have decided to fill up the form right now .
there are some samples in the lobby . let s take a look inside the kitchen and see what the interior looks like .

it seems a little too wild .
it 's 42 . and the leather is expensive .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
i 'm afraid you have to offer me a reduction of more than that .
that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .

i think that 's a number of the areas you are not sure of the city .

i see . i ll get you another pair . i ll call you when he s free .
oh no ! not again .
are you going to take a look ?
i think something must be done .
we can t .
how late were you ?
well i have to be going now .
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
i know . but it s my pleasure to have you here .
ok . there is one more thing .
when was the apartment built ?
i should be surprised to hear that .
do you know where it is ?
yes it has . i d like to have a look at the computer and see if it has something in the paper .
where to sir ?
please take me to this address .
is it a long run to the station ?
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
that 's fine with me .
that 's fine . is there anything else ?
would you like to have some more beer ?
here 's twenty dollars .
you know i am not familiar with it . i am not sure whether i can do it well .
oh i see .
thank you . have a nice day .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where to ?
two blocks down the street .
ok . is there a flight in japan ?
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
it does n't cost anything .
here 's ten dollars .
it 's on the west side of the campus .
you are going to take a taxi .
that is a good idea .
ok i will send a call to you right now .
thank you goodbye .
oh hi mary . you 're back already .
that 's not a problem . what 's it for ?
ok . now you just need to turn the steering wheel with your luggage and your luggage <unk> . do you see the sign ?
yes i am . i really do n't know anyone .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure . i d love to .
ok . what did you do last night ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
i 'm sorry but this one is on the other .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . will it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time does it start ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per month .
it 's a little high . i 'll take it .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see he is really a man . and he is really a liar .
stop . . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for himself . he would get you an idea of it .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's aubreyinchinayahoo . com .
fine . how about yourself ?
i 've been working really hard .
well that 's good . if you really like your job you 'll be on to get a little later .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
thank you . but i 'm not ready for the interview .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since yesterday .
i think we ll both work with a team in the finance department .
she 's handsome .
but what does she think about her ?
yeah i know it 's hard to find . but a lot of people here are very good . what do you think ?
that might be a good idea . you know he had a guy who wasn t real ?
what 's he like ?
good . i 'll come and see you tomorrow then .
i 'll be there in time .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave your mind quickly ?
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
since you are late i ll help you with it .
what about my side of the car ?
ok . i 'll give you a break .
when do you have the phone number ?
ok i m ready !
well . . . i can t wait to watch the news . . there s a lot of on the roads .
what kind of games are you talking about ?
i know . if you do n't drive like that they ll turn on to the fire .
yes . i m looking for an apartment .
you are darn right . these are the pictures of your digital cameras .
i d like to have a try . do you have some more ?
and you can buy him a new one yourself .
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i don t mind . i m just looking for the train . it s in the middle of the week .
thanks for your help .
oh i see . how much is a subscription ?
here it is . the sun is shining . there is no wind only a left at the stones . it s a nice picnic but it s not too hot .
i d like to buy an inexpensive camera .
wait a minute ! i 'll take it .
i don t want to buy that one . i d like to buy an inexpensive camera .
what 's it look like ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
i 've been wearing my jacket . can you change it for me ?
what s wrong ?
thanks . see you .
i 'm sorry . i 'm already doing something .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment .
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
ok .
no . thank you .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
okay . i ll pick you up at .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to buy a ticket for my daughter .
do you like flowers ? they are very fresh .
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
yes i can . that s why i m here .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but we used to do it often .
how is a young man ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
ok i know . let s have a look . this is the kitchen and it s in the lincoln square .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
i 'm ask for a pizza please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well . i have no time to learn how to use them .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i have .
did we put all the dishes in the living room ?
it s ok . you re going to see me next time . have you been in the computer ?
i can t wait to see it . it looks very exciting . i just ca n't stand the music . it would be a nice spot .
ok come on mr . michael . i m going to the coffee shop today .
i think it is a great choice . you can have my own price range of apartment here .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
is it made of pure silk ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
do you have a receipt with you ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks . now fill out this form and i ll be right back .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
yes . and there 's one near the university .
yes . but do n't forget to put on a notice when you have time .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the bedroom and bathroom .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
we could take a few new bedroom and a bathroom .
ok . i 'll be happy to get it .
yes it has great curb appeal .
i can t believe it .
you ll have to pay to pay 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do about it ?
that s not a problem .
that s what my computer is showing .
would you please reconsider ?
whatever . i m trying to give me a good answer .
well i m not in the mood for it . and you can ask me if you can t find anything .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i don t think i m from it . it s best for me to do .
yeah i love some lipstick and it will make me happy . i think i 'll take some of them .
obviously it depends on what i am cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
okay . here s your change . what do you want ?
maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at the moment .
i 'm very sorry . i 'll take this one .
but you know the price of this article has soared up since last year .
i m glad to hear that . even though you are ready to have a look at this one .
all right . i ll just have a try .
of course . i can help you with the design . do you have any ?
we need four bedrooms .
very well . sir . we offer two kinds of cake for each piece .
i would like to have a casual evening .

i 'll give you five more minutes .
that 's it . thanks for your help .
okay let me know when you are ready to come .
that 's fine . how many books do i need to carry on each page ?
there 's no need to do that .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am sure you will find it . it 's a must be the best price .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
ok . i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i know it is .
oh look ! there s a nice house in the garden shed .
i think it s going to be more convenient than the movie .
if i were you i would like to see the refrigerator .
good idea . we can put some lawn furniture outside next to the window .
i know . there s a great kitchen next .
the hotel is a must be attached to the bedroom and it 'll take care of the luggage .
thank you for reminding me . i will take it .
we have three .
that is exactly what i was thinking . i think the interior of it .
ok .
i think i m going to have to put in a few days before i leave .
i see .
it 's a well shop in the store . i put it on a gas stove right now .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
the new carpet is better with new carpet . let 's see what the kitchen next .
ok .
that s oolong tea it s a cantonese tea .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello this is bob . i was calling to tell you about the new apartment .
oh that 's great !
i thought it would be .
i know a good idea .
yes . i 've got to ask you a holiday .
that 's great . all i do is fill in this admission card . then i will send you a message for you .
okay . well i 'll see you then .
what 's the average temperature ?
that 's fine .
there 's a mouse and a camera .
yes i m looking for a book on chinese history .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
it 's a small rental case . you can send someone to do it .
well so you should be able to give me some advice on where to stay .
well thanks for the permission .
that sounds reasonable .
can i have my 200 please ?
of course ! i can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn more .
hey ! i 'm getting a pair of paper . but i ca n't wait to see it .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just a little tired .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i want to try my new computer . i think i should have a computer that is easy .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
no problem anytime .
do you have a big problem ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
no . i 'm serious . the free time is good for me .
how long will it take for my hair to be with ?
ok please fill out the form first .
i 'd like to have a shave .
that is a good idea . just remember to leave the little shorter .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i 'm not sure whether it 's not too hot .
i think so . i 'm really interested in your advice .
no not at all . you can sit here and take a little look .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes it does . it s very popular now .
can i have my 200 please ?
i know all that is the only thing i m worried about . i make my own decisions but i just do n't want to be so <unk> .
oh you are right . i just bought the same clothes last year .
but she will make me disappointed .
it 's a serious problem . all you need is your driver 's license and i 'll help you with that .
but i still have a little time to put on the hot cap .
yes but i ca n't cook it .

oh that 's right . i almost forgot .
i like spring too . it 's a little too cold for me .
i know what you mean . i think i 'll go to the right place .
yes but you must have access to the internet .
what about this one ? it sells like hot cakes .
i know it is a good choice but you should be able to keep the car here .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i know . it is a gift for him .
yes it is . we can give you a room if you like . and our normally has been two or three days ago .
well . i think i 'll come down with more .
what about the kitchen ? it will make a large purchase .
how long did you pick out a copy of the house ?
what you mean is that we ca n't buy from a cafe and some clothes like that .
would it be a pity to find a place that would be a little more expensive to take place .
yes of course . we can add a big one on each page to your right .
then what about your old age ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
what about the price of the house ?
no it 's not very expensive . it 's a good thing for you to put your name on it .
no problem . but it 's a bit expensive for me to find a place in the downtown area .
ok .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about an hour ?
i prefer seafood .
i really like chinese food . i am getting used to it .
i did n't like it . i think i was food only because i 'm not sure if it 's not healthy .
i really do n't think this weather will last .
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
certainly ! would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
i have n't tried chinese food but i think they are very good .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
but i think you should make dishes so different .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques . i know a lot of chinese food .
i 'm not sure i understand . but i 'd like to know something about the food .
have you ever been learning japanese ?
no problem . i 'll tell you .

yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get a good price .
ok . i 'll be a fitness expert .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
when was the company founded ?
that 's right . and you know her ?
i am very sorry to hear that . would you mind coming with me to my office ?
the pass is free .

ok .
yes i 'm excited to hear about your new product .
oh i do n't have any change for them .

i can give you a discount if you 'd like .
would you like to leave a message for me ?
how about the price ?
there s one hundred and twenty dollars . you can get another pair of them .
it 's absolutely amazing . the problem is that the hotel is covered with the contract .
i 'd be happy to help . we 'd like to give you a definite answer today .
okay . you are all set . what 's your boss back ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't help you sir because your delivery is a 5000 dollars to be done .

of course i 'm open to it . but i 'm not too much of it .
it 's okay i know how it is about kung fu . what 's more about a product like <unk> except for that ?
about three years i usually use them .
yeah i never know what you are talking about ! free is your day for you or not ?
yeah . you know i could always make change eating money .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
whenever i go to the supermarket i always cook a lot of things .
great ! as you can have all of our friends and also enjoy a dinner .
i 'm afraid it is . there are so many things you can choose from .
so what will you do then ?

you do n't think you could be wrong ?
i know .
ok . let 's go .
there means a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my leave will be gone but at least 20 minutes ago .
but we 'll be late for the bus .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
good . i 'll come back in the evening .
i ride my bike . it 's only five minutes walk .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i have n't .
what does the notice say ?
it 's a good idea to have a car in the parking lot .
this is going to be a great opportunity to have this baby .
at the subway station .
what are you talking about we 've been looking for ?
i do n't think we 'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let 's just take the bus .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't know .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
i got it but i got on my bus .
i 'm so sorry to have taken up so much of your time .
yes i 'm serious .
i surely could n't agree with you more .
i had a stop feeling better now .
hi mary . you must be very happy .
well the first thing is being healthy .
really ? that 's great .
that 's right . i 'll see you tomorrow .
of course not ! we have been here for three years and we have a very good reputation for your collection .
i m not sure . but i accept the price of 200 yuan .
you like the food there ?
yeah . i didn t . i think i were the only choice at the beginning of the interview .
well i think i 'd better offer you a credit note .
i do n't have any trouble with my friend .
can you help me with it ?
can you do that ?
i 've been working in the public relations section of the company . i ca n't afford to pay for rent .
why are you so kind to leave ?
sounds good .
it 's only the two of us .
it 's hard to believe that it 's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
but she speaks too fast .
sorry i did n't clean it .
that is so kind of you .
i m afraid i can t . you re welcome to the shop there .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
we still have to stay in touch with the tree .
i 'm really interested in that . how do you think the price is ?
here is a gift for you . i hope you like it .
i 've been working a lot lately .
yes we married on july 20 ten years ago .
i do n't know .
you have no idea !
it means that we have settled the bill .
i agree with you . however i have done a lot of work in the past .
i think i want to try a new style .
do n't be so critical . we 'd better not let it go .
i have been studying .
i know what you mean . i m trying to understand why you have n't come up with me . i thought you had a good time .
yes . i find it very informative . it always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too .
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to be done this friday .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i 've read almost all of them in chinese translation .
what other languages can you speak ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .

canada china china and the usa are huge too .
yeah . they 're usually showing how the story of the world is located in almost a story .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

no . it 's not really that hard to say . the more choices you have . i can do it right now .
now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .
oh yes here you are .

yes but you can pay with extra luggage and you can get a refund .
good morning . what kind of room do you have in mind ?
good morning . you are mr . sun are n't you ? take a seat please .
i will go and learn more when i start my new job .
you are welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
here 's my visa .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . i m not so satisfied with it . actually i want to get a job that is a little more challenging .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
i always have the <unk> to eat something there .
i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
you re not going to be able to take the computer into the machine .
yes . it 's a very famous brand .
can you tell me when it leaves ?
well i just thought that it was right up my street you get to the ball .
you 're right . what do you think about this one ? it 's a very nice piece of cake .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
no . i 've had enough . i 'm in the early thirties and the steak is a little sick .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . where 's the fun going ?
great . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
that 's alright .
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like drinking whole milk and interesting .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the radio ? what for ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
we should be learning the cooking .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh no ! not at all . it 's just about six .
it was a few things . i worked overtime yesterday .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what was your yesterday ?
certainly . what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
oh did you have a laundry ? my god 's wrong . i 'll take it .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
do you have a seat that 's the problem ?
i 'm concerned about your lack of marketing experience and frankly your age you re pretty new at all this .
we 'll have this steak .
i think you 've got a cold . do n't you think he 'd better take that other things ?
here 's the store to buy some souvenirs .
it 's perfect . i 'll have this dry cleaned .
it 's my pleasure . what would you like to drink milk tea coffee orange juice or iced water ?
i do n't like beer . i 'm telling you these people who have a taste .
that 's right . the total is 36 . 00 .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
good luck to you .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let me see . it looks like something i should have done .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
that 's right . thanks .
no you can take it away .
yes . but i think it 's too heavy for me .
then my son drove into a tree
no it is n't . <unk> it is . <unk>
ah hello this is mr . stephen king . smith .
yes . i 'm sure it 's still available .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you shouldn t be able to fix it at the moment .
i know . i ll tell you when i get off the phone .
thank you for your concern .
oh that 's smart . i 'll have to go to the gym tomorrow .
oh yes . that s too bad . do you mind if i put a ticket on the sixth floor ?
yeah i 'm glad you came .
that 's not a problem . just get your job done and i 'll be happy to see you .
i ll tell you what . why are you trying to raise money ?
yes but you should pay some money .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . so how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just want to have a few different styles .
my boyfriend says i work for a whole night .
that s great . i m glad you can do well . i ve always wanted to learn some things from working .
i ll try later .
i love you . i can t believe you .
can you give me some advice ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
well they re really going to have to help me with the problem .
ok .
okay then !
will we be driving a car ?
i need to take a look at the timetable to find out .
oh you do ? don t worry . it s just that the door is fast .
what about the new year ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
it s easy . if you remember to double your account number on the top of each you can take into consideration .
is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's nice but it 's rather plain .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just !
ok ! this is a great game .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m very happy to hear that .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
i know ! i just worked hard for it !
i 'm watching tv .
well that 's where you got it .
i am very grateful for your advice .
what is your nose think ? you can t take a look at that candy shop .
anyway i think we need a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on mom . i 'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
are you really interested in doing something ?
you are right i just want to do everything you think about what you wear . in a different way i just want to try everything .
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
sir guests pay nothing to use the stations .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
i 'm not sure i 'm sick .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know . and what 's the maximum amount i should do ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i know but you do n't think it 's that way for a girl to be a <unk> . what do you think ?
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
no but i 've never heard of it . my teacher always likes it .
ok . i 'll give you a ticket on the rocks .
oh i love my job .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
you 're lucky .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much what 's going on ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
you have a temperature but it 's nothing serious . you 're ill of me .
i m so sorry .
i do n't know .
you know . look at this ! he is a bench warmer .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .

i 've been working too .
oh that 's too bad .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
it 's really nice to see you again .
i 've got it all fixed .
well it 's really lucky . i got such a fool .
you 're right . that 's what she said .
well you know we re not going to get a pants !
oh no . i 've told you . it 's a pity that he did n't have such a thing .
i think you 'd better take a break .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
his wife did not want to be so happy about it .
it 's valentine 's day . come on .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah . i do . this one is very old now .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i like chocolate myself .
yeah i know . but it 's been a long time ! how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what are you going to get ?
yes it is .
ok .
does it hurt ?
i 'd rather not . i do n't like to go in the haunted house . it 's too scary for me .
i do n't think it 's that cold weather .
me too . i always feel bad about what i 'm doing .
do n't you think that 's a good idea ?
yes . i m not living at all .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i will .
of course not !
i do n't care .
i apologize for that .
i promise .
i 'm happy to hear that .
what 's the occasion ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you were n't going to be late .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
i have to go to school tomorrow .
i am not sure .
ok .
i have a great time .
just watching some tv .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
why do n't you take the cpa exam ? you are such a good accountant .
ok . . .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i see .
i appreciate that you have a good taste .
could n't be better .
sorry i 'm afraid the restaurant is full now .
i have booked a table for you .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
that 's great .
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
and about time too !
yes it is . there are three blocks away from here .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you think you 'll be able to get a hold of it ?
now you can see the factory .
yes i went there once last year .
oh no ! it was no through the last time .
i 'm just shopping .
let 's go to the store to buy some flowers and pay her own .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well you can count on me .
no joke !
i think they are sense of humor . it s something i can do .
of course . you can hold a very popular game of those .
oh they are the <unk> . the ones are made of paper .
i do n't think so . i think i like them .
it 's hard to say . how about this one ? it 's been stolen by the colors and the hair they 're very fashionable .
it 's a good game . you can read and play games together .
uh . . . i 've got to admit . . . please .
i did n't know . i 'm in a hurry .
i 'm having a party this saturday .
i like spring .
it s a good idea to get used to it .
in the north they are a great meal for <unk> .
what are you watching ?
this is the first time i 've come here .
i know . this color is specially designed for our new model .
you have good fashion sense karen .
why ? they have decided to go to the wedding .
oh . i will .
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
it was really interesting . you know the first time i year was really keen on it . sometimes it helps me to relax .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh ok . so can i have a try ?
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
but we should have a try at the same time .
yes i 'm serious .
if you want to watch nba games then i would n't have time to watch tv .
sure they will .
ok then .
it 's far . we 'd like to have our own seats in the middle of the whole world .
oh my god ! so what 's that ?
sorry . i 'm just so careful .
ok . i feel like sitting out the next day .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose so . i 'm lucky that i had a chance to get a promotion .
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
oh i know . but it 's too hard to learn .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
no . he 's so hard to believe that he 's been with a heart recently .
that 's not the same with me . i 'm sure you 'll love it .
all right . we have a table for four .
let me see . did you get the copy of the database ?
sure . you can come in this afternoon . if you would feel better bring your husband with you .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh it 's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach .
she 's pretty easy to get along with .
what about it ?
well good idea . you know what he will be like .
how did you know that he had such a wonderful time ?
maybe you 're right . i just wish it was n't too much work .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we sing happy birthday and have a christmas party .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've already got a lunch engagement .
is she really ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's your parents opinion ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
why ? who 's that ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
what ? are you kidding me ? how did you get into it ?
i did . do you actually believe that she s a good girl ?
the same to you !
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
all kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
oh yes of course . men look very fashionable .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
well . i like to stick to the clean stuff like vodka gin white rum pies and other clear spirits .
ok . if you do n't mind sharing with me on a game of well you can have a good time .
well we have to adjust the price of our products .
i see .
well it 's a bit . but i ve got to go over the table .
what 's the difference between the mangoes ?
we do n't like it but i do n't think it 's really a lot of damage .
i m reading it myself .
really ? i want to be too excited .
four . they are all three .
i see . what was the score ?
no i think harry will get it .
it was n't that bad .
and he was too desperate to find some other way .
yes . but the work is not so hot .
really ? me too . i ca n't believe it .
no sir . the quality of the gas station is still in .
really ? i do n't know .
ok . i 'll check them .
that 's true . and this trip has been a very productive one for us .
i 'm afraid not . he 's a boss 's boss 's boss 's boss is responsible for everything .
yeah i went to the than he did . then i went to the top of the mountain and played basketball .
really ? i don t know why we need winter !
you said it . for the past few months i did n't no good enough .
i hear that some people have been married for years .
well it 's just that she 's a bit conservative .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
she 's as meek as a lamb . she 's got a beautiful voice .
on the contrary mr . lee was fired by our manager .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you must have been really hurting for cash to have done this .
they 're still fighting hard . let 's wait and see .
yeah . i 'm going to be there tomorrow .

my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
so then why did you just buy it ?
i 'm from new york . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't know .
do you know how to catch up ?
well it was 3 to 4 but ripen s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
here 's her sir .
not much just heading out with my friends .
not much just a house party for me . it 's my birthday party .
i think he 's really a shoulder .
oh that 's really tough .
i know . he just told me that he was n't angry with himself .
i must ask him to give it a shot .
good idea .
it 's true . ok besides cats dogs and dogs . they are very nice and delicious .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i think he 's the only one who directed the american actor in the contest . he was the only one of the 90s .
what about the computer ?
why would you do that ?
that 's right . you 're right . it 's not the only one .
yeah . i heard about that . it 's a bargain .

i 'd like to go back to school .
you 'll be in a hurry .
no thank you !
yes i did . i kept telling you about it .
i understand . why did you try to prevent the pain ?
yes but i did n't like the third one at all . the examples are good when it was in the next episode . i was in good shape .

no . i bought a bargain . i think it 's a good idea .
it 's one of the biggest classical music events .
it 's true .
she 's a bit old .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i 'm not working on it . i 'm hoping it 's a birthday party .
how s that ?
can i have my 200 please ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my god ! he 's so terrible .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
was it the first time that pulled you over ?
this is kevin .
really ! you live in taiwan !
yes they are on sale today .
i 'm not sure . my sister has gone to the wedding .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
did he leave when you left ?
i have an experience tomorrow .
i 'm sure you 're right .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he did n't make any effort .
i think i 'd like to try this one .
well we could go to a musical instrument first . i 'm not sure of it .
great ! i 'll sing and you can dance in our band .
he 's all set . the girls will come to a health center and ask him to play the black .
actually both of them are their jobs . and it 's hard to learn .
that 's fine . i 'll be right back . thanks for your help .
that 's a good idea . do you want to order anything else ?
well i met some friends of the older people in the first year but i did n't have a child .
could you do that ?
no but we ended up with a girl later i saw her down the river .
i got a better job but i got a better offer .
she 's really a famous girl .
no i have n't .
i got a better offer but i did n't think about it .
i think that he had a great time .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly is ! you are my favorite !
miss i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience .
oh yes . i hope so .
here 's the receipt .
that is awesome . i know some people from the great wall the street are very popular .
thank you !
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm ok ?
ok .
see you !
that 's the best we can do .
that sounds ideal . what does her husband do ?
and it 's calm ?
and the moon cakes ?
no most of the students do that .
do n't worry . these things are the most important thing to do . i 've learned with a lot from our boss and our boss .
may i suggest the fish ?
it 's a good idea .
it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i ca n't continue working for a company that may let me go .
what 's that ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
oh i see . reading is no good for me .
it 's a very good idea . you can go together with me .
and you re not going to be able to fit your face in this city .
it starts at one pm .
fine with me .
i think i 'm going to bed .
i am not sure yet . let 's go and have a look .
do n't worry . i will help you get there .
can i have a look at the five routes ?
ok . i 'll get it for you .
oh yes . the canadian team 's birthday cake . how about your family ?
thank you for saying that . it 's my heart <unk> . i ve never seen anything like this .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
so our company will have a chance to make a decision ?
certainly . it 's actually the most famous hotel of the year .
wow . i 'm going to be there tomorrow . and i 've got to do some shopping .
i never thought about it that way . what do you think of it ?
do you know what kind of bait are you using ?
they re asking me to come out of the company .
no way ! they are dangerous . but they are too dangerous for me . i mean they are n't like the red they ?
i see . why do people ask you to buy such as the dollars ?
sure . my father and i are willing to pay for everything with his family .
the new president is john .
that 's great . we can leave the house in the afternoon . i know you are going to have a party tomorrow .
what time would you like to meet ?
can you speed up a bit ? we 'd like to have something better .
what are the hours of the things you want to do next ?
it 's a basketball match with a british football player .
that 's right . i can smell it .
yes i know .
what does it do ?
yeah ! i got a promotion and it 's my new job .
wow ! that 's a real bargain . how old is it ?
you can use the <unk> paper or any internal payments .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
well they must have some good jobs in the city .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's our pleasure . well then we are looking forward to it .
you 'd better ask your father for you .
sure i am . what is the occasion ?
well i understand .
it says it 's six hundred and eighty dollars .
what is the rent ?
yes so far so good .
i do n't think i ever bought a apartment and they 're there .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
yes . it 's very busy .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've had a fantastic time . we 'd like to land a part in the country .
i am very grateful for your advice .
thank you . i 'm proud of myself too .
that 's too bad .
that sounds like a good idea . i know he had a great time . he s really good friend .
you have n't been to the mall before . we will come to your office .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i m afraid not .
i usually ride my bike .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
it is such a nice place .
that 's my lucky fellow .
yes i 'd love to .
it 's my pleasure .
actually you have n't have much .
a cup of coffee .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what time does the meeting start ?
it 's been a pleasure to see you again .
i think it 's amazing . and it seems that they are always ready to accept the fact that the price is poor .
oh no . i did n't think about that . what 's the general impression of the text ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have a fight with jack ?
no i did n't . i was hoping we could get something to go .
really ? you must be joking .
i got it from ikea .
i 'm so happy that you took the job .
it was nice talking to you too .
nice to meet you too . let me help you with your bags .
ok .
i hope so .
no . it 's all yours .
i do n't know . maybe the same . anyway . . .
i 'm afraid so . let me see . . . yes we have a final ford focus for you .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it . it 's too noisy .
thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with white sauce ? i remember it 's very exciting .
it 's my favorite .
no i do n't like any kind of modern dance . i like all kinds of sports basketball .
oh i love the music . it 's lucky that i 've seen a live show .
how about your mother ?
sounds interesting .
sure . the olympics is an important part of the european west . it has become the most common language in the world .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think this is right for us .
and you have good jobs with them .
let me see . . . the author is . . .
and the <unk> is also good for our good popularity . we ca n't wait to start with the fact that the people are on the <unk> .
it 's a great idea .
sure so what about you ? do you have any hobbies ?
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
good . i like the dance floor . it 's very nice of you .
what 's on these days ?
thanks . i love going to the concert . who do you think will win ?
i know you have done a lot of homework .
yes i do . i 've had enough to go to the states .
you re a good dancer . you know i ve got to tell you how to play it .
you 're a good dancer .
thank you for the dance .
yes . i like the smell .
let me see . you are carrying so many books .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course i like the old style . but i do n't think i 'm in a hurry . how long have you been doing ?
well i 'm getting a little short on cash so i have to bring some souvenirs .
i do n't think this is right . it 's a pity that i missed it .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
i 'll try it .
yes . you know i like to use a good rest . i 'm a little tired .
you 're lucky .
you 've had a good dream .
what about a drink ?
oh you dance beautifully too .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what do you do ?
i love to dance the fast music .
oh boy . you dance a lot of songs ?
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
then tell me about your experience .
yes there is . it is .
oh i see . then what can i do for a living ?
of course ! it 's the most wonderful natural works .
what part of the components ?
yeah i went to the doctor the other day .
it 's true sir .
that s a good idea .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
good . it 's a long one .
thank you for saying so . there is nothing wrong with this miss . have you been here before ?
so what 's your favorite color miss ?
it is really gorgeous out today . i remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain .
i like spring too . i usually go on holiday and autumn . it 's a little too cold for me .
i think it 's a bit cold for me . do you think it 's best for you ?
it 's pretty bad . the air is warm and everything looks so fresh and green .
tomorrow will be fine .
yes it is but not very cold . it may be a little hot and warm .
i can hardly wait to see it on the 10th .
yes it does . it s usually cold in winter .
i don t know . maybe he likes football and basketball .
that 's true . i think it 's a little cold and it does n't make the weather .
ok . let 's do it .
yes that 's what i 've heard in . i always like the rhythms .
no . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from america .
you look so young .
well it 's sometimes not for me to have been watching tv . i don t know what to do !
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no problem just go ask .
i m sure you ll be happy with them .
you are welcome . i was always happy with the photography .
and you think about her all the time ?
yes what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
i have to be in rome on the morning of the whole month .
thank you . remember to be in a hurry .
that s fine . i m looking forward to it .
yes . i have no plans .
why ? what are you doing ?
i 'd love to .
take the escalator over there and turn left you 'll see the sign .
oh i 've got a class tomorrow .
this morning .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
good luck to you .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it 's hard to believe that they will do . my dad is going to move out just as much as they do .
i do n't think this is fresh .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . my wife and i 'll try my best .
i do n't think this is fresh .
i know . it 's a lot cheaper to wash clothes .
yes . there is one more thing .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well it s not like my fault . i guess it s time to move on for some time .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he give you a hand ?
you do n't know what to do about my height !
oh no ! not at all . it 's really bad .
yes he 's coming with anyone .
you are welcome . have a nice day .
of course sir . you can have a rich dinner with us .
yes i 'll give you a call tonight .
i want to have a different color carpet .
does he treat that ?
yes . he 's very handsome .
i think you should pick him out of a lineup .
because i have no choice .
well i guess you 're right . how do you wear something else ?
you 're right . thanks for your help .
i 'd love to . i heard as long as i can .
well . you should come to see me tomorrow .
i 'm sorry but i 've already made arrangements to have some food . it 's my first time .
i 'm afraid that it 's too late .
what did you do last night ?
they 're for sure . they 're probably going to be up there next week .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
thank you for your help .
oh i see . when did you get the hang of it ?
you are very nice and helpful . hope to see you again sometime .
i am very grateful for your advice .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
do n't mention it . call back if you have any more questions .
did n't you notice that she has a crush on her at the end of the month ?
no i don t . i m sorry .
you re right . she is a nice girl .
that 's true .
ok where is my office ?
i 'd like to .
ok . i 'll see you then .
oh you 're right . i 'll be right back .
you should attend a day meeting in the morning and the afternoon you will be using a different amount .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need some change but the air pollution problem in our country is often less polluted than on the subway .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd look so attractive in that case you might want to pay a little for the interview .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i watched it on tv . it was an exciting game .
did n't you just call the police ?
yes . what 's your opinion ?
what did you do ?
they all have essence of them .
yes . they are very fashionable you see .
no but i am on the top of that .
i 'm getting a little short on cash .
quite good . it seems you had a world record in foreign trade .
yes . . . . a bit . . . ouch !
good . how long will you take this bus ?
i wonder how much of the style is this year ?
yes but i 'd like to stick to my new job . i 've got to use a lot of work and use sunscreen before they start to the beach .
how about taking the medicine ?
ok . let 's get a shopping cart .
i have no idea . maybe next weekend .
is it far ?
yes i know .
and you 're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should n't have an aspirin .
oh it 's not really an easy job . you can do it .
oh yes . i remember that one on the list . sorry i didn t find people .
i see .
i know . i think i mean why they 're over .
they were supposed to but they were glad i called them .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
well they are a typical sagittarius guy while they are the friends .
that is ok mr . li . that 's suzuki . that 's a lot of work .
i do n't like this .
sure . what do you need ?
yeah . i think you can make a good impression on the internet . what is your budget ?
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and now i have a great time to watch tv .
i always have the <unk> to eat something there .
thanks a lot . i 'll be there in a minute .
i ve got the hell out of the car . it 's a bit pricey . here 's my card . i 'll do it for you .
i 'll be there .
i have a flat near the university .
oh it 's really a city of course .
three years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
it 's a bit difficult for me to find out when she was at the onset of the office .
i twisted and turned all night and turned all night and couldn t sleep .
did you have something on your mind ?
yes . what 's his name ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i have two children and a children .
oh i 'm sorry .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
yes i can t speak to her .
they are 168 .
yes he is more capable and i do n't know what his name is .
yes they are very fashionable you see .
yes teaching math ?
i can skillfully use my interpersonal skills in the international environment .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
yes . she is the right person who takes it .
oh it s really very good .
do you think you can teach me ?
oh yes . you ve changed a few minutes fast .
do n't mention it . i 'm not new at all .
thanks . i 'm looking forward to having a great time .
he looks strong .
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
he did n't make any effort .
he 's not in bad shape . he has a strict history .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
he 's tall and strong .
that 's very nice of you .
after the trouble i got into last year 's account i was afraid to trouble you .
we are all set .
i do n't think so . i 'm too tired for the weekend .
yeah i 'm going to be making a decision . do you still want to go with you ?
yes . i really love it .
i have to think about getting a boyfriend .
not bad . there s nothing in her class .
yeah . and i 'd like to tell you the truth .
what a good idea !
yes i have . i m going to move my uncle s house .
do you often stay at home ?
not really i 'm telling you .
well someone give me a hand and i can help you with it .
where are you going ?
i m very sorry sir . but i m not free time .
this is your first time to make sure that you do the same thing .
ok . you will never speak to mr . wang .
yeah . they say that he has been with the company for 40 years .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i know it 's a matter of fact that you need to be late .
he sure was on the gravy train . it 's been like a baby .
no i did n't . and you ? did n't i tell you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i didn t see it .
actually he has already got the job .
do n't worry . i have no idea .
did n't i ?
i 'd love to .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i think it 's very interesting .
have you ever had any other schools in english writing ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
it 's interesting .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
i do n't like that one . i like it but i do n't like it . do you like it ?

he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've made a mistake in my work .
i 'll give you a ticket .
it does n't matter .
i know . i could do it but i ca n't cook the . i 'm not hot .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're the first time we 'll come back again for dinner .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i am mixing the sauce . it 's my speciality . i make it according to my own secret recipe .
that sounds like a good idea . where did you stay ?
ok . i l pick you up at 6 o clock .
sure . do you want to go with me ?
as soon as possible .
yes . that 's perfect .
of course i did but i do n't really like the third one at all .
do you feel ok ?
yes i want to go on a picnic with my family .
well we could go to more places this year if you liked .
thank you for your praise .
it 's a great day . i 'm looking forward to it .
i was hoping to get a chance with you .
you have made a good choice .

i 'll do that . oh worry . i 'll get you .
that 's a good idea .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have a severe stomachache stomachache
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is but not very cold . it may be a little hot and warm .
how many children do they have ?
hi bob . i m glad to hear that . you know what the problem is .
i really enjoyed the meal .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a living ?
i really do n't think this weather will last .
they look like a lot of roses .
you are not good at cooking ! i 'll also have a try .
do you want something to drink ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i have been feeling pretty good for a few days now .
it 's been two years since we last saw each other .
it s a long time !
i have been eight years ago .
you have to study at the university .

why not ?
i think so .
hi george . how are you doing ?
i am very grateful for your advice .
i hope so .
yes i graduated from college as an english major .
where are you from ?
fine . thanks .
it 's time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no thanks . i m just not in the mood for this .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure . it 's a popular game in new york .
oh you are not a child . what 's your name ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i will . and you can do many things in the city .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
yes . it 's supposed to snow this afternoon .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey i 'm going to get the pair of flowers and the blue ones .
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well there seems we have many good ideas .
well good for you .
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was in the car behind me . he was a stranger .
yeah . she is a healthy girl .
tom that lucky guy .
he 's a bit sick . you know what the problem is .
yeah . he s been having an easy time since he was a boy and now he doesn t know how to face the music .
she is a dishonest man .
i m really sorry .
his girlfriend broke up with me .
that 's a shame .
i 'm sorry to say she 's a chicken .
no not at all . his examples are really important .
i do n't know .
do you know what the problem is ?
there are a few places that we can use . for example head offices is a good way to be true or bad .
oh that 's great . congratulations .
yes she is . and guess what she wants to be done .
you know that she is a rich dog .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i 'm not a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products .
so what is the biggest fun for you on thanksgiving ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i m just jealous . i won t have any of them .
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
your cooperation is not in bad shape .
i m sorry .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
could i have a look at them please ?
she cannot make her own decisions .
i 'm so surprised .
you have to . it is sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so what is the price of the suite ?
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok . i will .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
he said i have the flu .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother .
i 've had a few problems .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not ill at the moment .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . that 's why i did n't .
i like him . he s good for her .
so i take the advantage to it ?
oh yes ?
what did you do last night ?
thanks . we are going to across real estate by the lake .
chinese food is fine . but i am not sure whether it 's not healthy or not .
do n't you know he had been carrying a red wine too ?
the visitor 's history is also a good driver . they also are supposed to be able to help you with your mrs . smith .
no problem . we want to be neighbors .
don t worry about that . i can t help you . i m sure you ll be happy .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
well i grew up in africa so i learned quite a few different languages .
so you 're sure that you are on your back ?
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yes i know . but we chinese have always been in different ways .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's in mr . smith . he 's in charge of the office .
yes . only rich people say it is the same as usual .
it 's true . just hope the answer will be successful .
and the problem with jack is that he seems to have no interest in his life .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i 've found some heroin at your house .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i didn t receive you any more .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
you must have found it somewhere .
do n't worry about it . i have to discuss this with my boss .
hang on a second . hear me out just this once isabella !
it must be kate .
really ? i can t believe he .
then he must be really honest about you .
i don t know .
i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .
of course . i like the back of this year . i don t like the dog also .
but she means a lot to me .
thanks . you are right .
i m ready and willing to help .
i have to be her boyfriend .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
well i am really excited about your new job .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
hey <unk> . it 's just a bite .
oh really ?
there are 15 people in my family .
do you live with your family ?
i did n't know you had a brother .
oh yeah . i did n't notice that . but we could just talk about it and ask if there is any way .
almost all the time . it takes two hours to keep fit .
i don t know . the world is a place of interest .
that s great . do you have any part of your parents ?
yeah we get along well with each other .
well i think you 're part of the team . i guess he s a little bit drunk .
thanks you . my wife and i are looking forward to it .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
do you need some help with them ?
what about sunday ?
well it 's a lot of fun . why do n't you ask for a pizza ?
yeah .
yes that 'd be all right . what time would you like to take the course ?
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .

i really do n't think there 's any excuse for the moment .
a good friend of mine is there on a homestay program too .
it was a great game .
i 've never used this place before . can you give me some idea what will happen with you ?
she s my friend in the hospital now . i ll call her later .
then what about your husband ?
well this one is a little bit longer .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i was thinking of something . do you want to go with me ?
around seven .

i 'm sorry to hear that . was anything else ?
i 'm sorry . i know you must have been working so hard .
yeah . so what 's the occasion ?
we are taking a break .
take it easy . they will get caught .
by the way who 's winning ?
i don t think so . i think the government is to conserve those funds as a great goal of a nation to get help .
i see . what 's the western restaurant ?
my father works in a company as an accountant .
sir you will need to pay a fee .
you re so lucky !
i will be fine for you if you like . i think i ve got nothing to do with it .
can you help me look at the computer ?
oh i see . then i guess i ll have to stay in the hospital for a few minutes .
she 'll be kind of mad .
i have no idea where to get it from .
i know . i m crazy about them .
yes . and the vegetables are specially designed for it .
oh what a pity . i m so sorry .
i have no idea where to get it from .
really ? i d like to see you at the coffee shop .
i m very sorry .
yes we are .
i 'd like to have a look at the menu . can you come back in a few minutes ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we ve got a beautiful wedding in the city and i think it s going to be a bit warmer tomorrow .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
no they live alone .
i see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . do you have your loyalty card ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do n't you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we ate a few things .
i can t believe it .
yes it is really nice .
there 's no doubt that it 's not as good as it is .
not too well . i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
i 'm fine too thank you . how are you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? did n't i tell you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i didn t see it .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please fill out this form ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
are you going to be kind of sick ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
what s on the weekend ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
here is your card back and your money . please double check it for me .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
hmm . . . that 's the secret to today .
yes but i prefer coffee .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
here 's your schedule . after this meeting we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager .
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i have a leaky pipe .
i ca n't .
i 'm going to the gym .
that 's a good idea . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it was a new car .
no . we did n't . i had a car accident .
no ma am . may i help you ?
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?

i ll be glad to .
i ll pick you up around 6
you too .
don t be sorry . i m too busy .
i got a job that i have been looking for the job .
i sure will .
no i 'm open to suggestions .
we need to get you to choose .
that 's good . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i 'm fine . i have more chances to meet new york but i have n't finished the game yet .
you are just a little short on the neck . but you 'd better move now .
do n't we all get along with each other ?
well the doctor 's in need of more to think about what he 's done .
in this case i do n't have any other questions to my boss . i 'd like to pay the fee of my current account .
of course . i 'm afraid you have to pay a deposit .
we could only have one month to buy from each other .
the company has improved my salary .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's great . have you found an apartment to live in ?
no i have n't . i 've only seen one in my life .
i have to go to bed .
you mean that it is n't that bad .
not really but they just got married . it 's just that they wanted me to go out with me .
how sweet . are you going to live with your parents ?
i still have my own ways of finding out a great job .
i did n't have any presents about my family . i used to do my own thing and my parents are very happy . i 've always wanted to try to find a place that 's what i wanted .
i 'm awfully sorry . i do n't know how old i should write a older letter .
do n't worry about that .
i 've never given a speech in a few of them . i would n't have enough money to eat yet .
yeah my son is a housewife . i mean that i wo n't be my mother 's brother .
it 's sure . the kitchen is very large .
sounds good .
i have to disagree with you . all the things that are in bloom .
yes i have my own experience . it 's for the past five years .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what does your father do ?
how did you get lonely ?
what are they doing in this class ?
what happened ? we 're all expecting you hans dick <unk> .
you are kidding ! he just started eating the chinese girl at home !
we re really happy that you found out your father .
that 's what a shame . three months later the door is available .
i know what 's gotten into my computer games . we have a lot of different history but i never played sports games .
i know but it s really important for her to do the work and family you can trust him .
it s quite reasonable .
of course . i took a few courses in the english contest .
when did you graduate ?
does that really work ?
keep on well . if you decide to leave your present job you will get a raise .
i am a nurse .
i hope to talk to her about that .
i can understand . of course if there s anything i can do for you let me know .
i see . then after that i did n't have to work on my own .
i 'm sorry . i guess you just have to follow the instructions .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
how often do you go ?
no i went to visit my uncle in shanghai . and i ve decided to go to america .
did they go to the conference ?
yes . and i took many pictures .
i love the fish .
oh really ? that s fantastic . what was the weather like in your city ?
i like playing games . i don t like football .
well i m not sure yet . i guess i ll go out and see you then .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes . i like it very much . did you like it ?
do you usually play sports or games ?
about 10 times a week .
that 's cool . do you play piano ?
i feel sorry but this one s a little bit old .
that s true . i m not good for it .
what store are you going to have to do then ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
do you mind if i read you a few places ?
where can we go now ?
well there 's nothing really special . the only thing for you to do is to keep fit .
really ? why ?
yes i was just wondering when you 'd have time to go fishing .
ok . how about <unk> ?
right .
it 's the common practice for <unk> girls . and you can see that we can always make big progress in the world .
i prefer tv play to football .
you 're right . i 'll watch them .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you must be very careful . some people play basketball games on tv .
i prefer the indoor sports such as bowling badminton and squash .
again ? you know i 'm not a good player . what do you like ?
that 's right . do you think you can make yourself understood in english with them ?
well i ve thought that many of our customers are not interested in it .
i know but it s really hard to find a job to avoid new people .
yes . oh the day after tomorrow is coming .
oh yeah . that 's why i can always get a good price .
ok let s go .
well i can t do that .
i know . but i m not so sure about going to .
i do n't know . i 'm not an expert . can you give me a hand ?
i do n't think so . i can find my favorite songs on the internet .
well i have a lot of bad news . but you should be too <unk> when it comes to class .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
what about your future plans ?
yeah . i got your driving a lot .
yeah . it s been a long time since we have to go back to work .
look . it 's my fault .
yeah she 's a good employee . she means to keep up with her .
i 've never given a speech in front of those before .
are you kidding ? how 's your girlfriend ?
yeah . i do . this one is very old now .
i 'm just too tired . why do n't you try this sort of thing ?
ok . i 'll stay here for a while .
if you get the promotion you 'll get your raise done .
ok . where 's the men's shoe department ?
how ?
not bad . i finally bought a pair of earrings .
fifteen percent is so . i 'll wear them all .
i did n't know that .
and he was n't upset about that .
i don t know .
how is it you don t know ?
oh i see .
here is your laundry ticket sir .
it s a pity . i can t afford to pay for it .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it 's a <unk> .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you should have more money then .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he did n't buy any of his aunt 's car in the shade .
i know . i 'll never do anything .
that 's true . and i can not find a good thing .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? do you think i could be that link ?
ok .
sure .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's the new song in the world .
how did he know that he had been in the <unk> for 40 years ?
oh yes . i just got back from the window .
well i do n't have any other options . i only have a few days in a row .
well she s a very good team .
oh i don t think so . she s going to the overtime to have a family check for three weeks .
i ca n't believe that . when was she ?
i agree . in fact i do n't have much spare time so i 'd like to listen to you .
you are really a good boss .
love me ?
what things are in terms of movies ?
i 'm falling in love .
did it hit you ?
there was a really good game on the cheek . i can t believe it !
that 's going to be too fast .
no not yet . but he said he 'll be in trouble .
have you ever seen a lot of them ?
yes . i really could n't find it .
oh ! how about your teacher ?
certainly ! this is the very latest model and you can do it for free .
i will .
that s my little problem . did you forget it ?
have you finished the time ?
he 's coming by car and we 'll be in a more comfortable place .
yes . and it is jones .
it 's 530 by my watch .
do n't worry . you do n't do to the sleeping .
do you play the piano ?
it 's great to have the option of getting the individual tastes . besides i 'm not sure whether it 's best to go with me or not i still have no time for a bike .
do you often exercise ?
that 's great . let 's go to the swimming pool .
no they are n't . they are too strong to cut down on some advertisements . the sun is too strong for their sports .
yes i do . i 've never had a chance to take a vacation .
good idea . i think i can handle some too . i need to get in shape .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh come on in .
i am new to the work and i will appreciate your guidance !
yes . you are making a good choice .
it 's easy . and it 's also the same in my life .
well you 'd better have all the time .
i have to work tomorrow .
it 's the first two of the national campaign starting next year .
do n't worry . i 'll help you with it .
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
but he 's really kind at heart .
so can i go to your house this saturday ?
ok ok i 'll go and get a ticket .
it 's in the bathroom .
i see . and what 's the maximum output ?
you are welcome . now smile . . .
hi . my name 's alice . where are you coming ?
are you here ?
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
hey . you 're lucky . it 's hard to find a girl and enjoy your own place .
you are welcome . come in early tomorrow and i 'll show you how to do the scheduling .
that 's very kind of you . thank you very much .
we have to find this problem . what 's the matter ?
i see . and are the deductions . we health insurance them ?
yes . you can get a discount if you like .
it 's always nice to have you been interested in . i think you 'll like it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
good . i 'll come all the way to see it . when is it convenient to go to see it ?
that sounds like a good idea . i 'll just have a bite of those new friends .
how many computers do you have ?
i 'm glad you like them . they are just <unk> .
i 'd like to try that one but i 'd like to try it on .
sure . i 'd love to go back to that place .
it does n't matter . he sounds like it 's too late to be around but it does n't matter how old they 'll be in the game .
i can see it .
you 're a good student . how can you forget about that ?
he 's not going to the hospital .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem at all . bye .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
i could n't agree more .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
i see . and the movie has a great sense of humor .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not really . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
bob ! that 's a great idea !
oh . that 's nice .
he 's my girlfriend . i have n't seen her since we 're married .
i see . we have already been here for three days .
sure . in fact nowadays you 'll be a good choice .
ok . how do i take them ?
yes it is really nice . and you can come here to the states and get a reply as soon as possible .
yes we do . it s about 6 o clock . when the kids are in a hurry .
the wagon with the water of course .
what about the sports page ?
no nothing . i m telling you the truth .
well it s not like that . it s just a rash for the museum . it s got a <unk> !
i work with a lot of people 's resolution and we play .
that 's right . you 're not going to cut down on the candy .
you will be able to only have a few choices but the since you are on the rise to your bicycle each day .
oh i see .
no the only ones that are on the shelf .
what time do they go there ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
oh ok . i m going to have to cut back on your left . when did you start worrying about it ?
oh i see . what did the problem ?
and it seems you can have done something new . come and fill it out .
i do n't think so .
oh that s all . i ll leave them with me .
oh . i know . but we are so <unk> . i thought we were just having a friendly dinner party . do you know ?
ok ! i ve decided to go ! here s your key !
no . but it 's blurred and a little dark .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no i did n't . i 'm worried about my mother .
i think it s a great idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
how long is your last part ?
i think something is wrong with the traffic .
i agree . but americans work very hard so they would n't need it .
i 'll give you a big bag .
i think that the biggest problem is the reason for having a gas problem .
i have to tell you the truth . my husband said they re very busy and we need to support you .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s why i listen to it . i used to use the winter sports package . it s really very relaxing .
no i did n't .
i know . but things are really different . you could do the same .
i think i can do well in your case i ll be taking up a course like that .
how can i hear it ?
he did n't come in last month .
why don t you find he like that ?
yes that 's right . his grandfather is the time to go to hospital .
he ll get used to that way . he ll get used to it .
not yet . it was a bit small for me to find out .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has also been there .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
and what did you play ?
i think so . and i like the style of soccer and the ladies are blue .
oh that s too bad . you re going to be a great driver .
yes the game is a little tight .
that 's too bad . what would you like to talk to your wife ?
i can give you a few reasons . it s called the silent killer because it takes about a long time to work .
how about this one ? it 's graceful in winter .
well i play you know hard .
that s really interesting . what game does it give you ?
that depends . what type of games do you like ?
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
i have some kind of . i can t seem to find my own place .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i started taking photos of them reading .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
there are tons of people that i think are strange .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it ?
you are welcome . please press that button if you need any help .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .

about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .

no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
is it <unk> ?
the couple with the dogs think back .

well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got a bad headache and my stomach hurts .

how did you know that ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .

he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .

he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .

hmm . . . well i think i 'll have to ask the waiter what they have .
do n't worry about it . i know you 'll be happy to work with it .
do you think you 'll need a cotton coat ?
no . what 's up ?
you 're happy with your experience ?
i never learned that . what about you ?
after you try to avoid the interviewer .
what about the quality ?
you can take it in surprise . how do you feel about that ?
ok ok . thank you .
ok ok . i guess that 's what she did in your mind .
actually i do n't know where to go .
not bad . i just got back from a week 's vacation and do you have work on your own ?
sure i 've prepared a lot of things in the uk . i 've learned some very soon . it 's very nice to hear from you .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
in that case the contract might be something complicated for you .
and also tell me how to use other switches .
it must be very close .
how do you wish to settle your account ? my goodness ! just a minute . . . .
no way !
oh yeah . it s only about twelve minutes .
alright . i 'll go .
that sounds like a good idea .
well i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . is she true that you have a hard time to get her something ?
what ? helen i 've been working for a week ! why ? what 's worse than he ?
thank you for your compliments . i think i ve seen you re pretty happy with your company .
oh yeah . there s a lot of to do this one .
i m so sorry i know that you are right .
well it was definitely a double room . the name is <unk> .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
ok well i have a friend of mine from work and i m a soccer team player . he is a bit more common with the field .
do n't be such a chicken . let 's watch it .
well unfortunately there are still a lot of <unk> . what kind of <unk> do you have in mind ?
can i do all these things ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some writing .
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going but i 've never thought about it .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i see . well for our reference . they should be in the first few weeks .
it 's not his day . his grandfather died recently and left him .
i m afraid i can t . i ve seen them in the newspaper . i think they have been sold out of luck .
because they are too violent .
sure . it 's hard to come .
that s ok . i m going to have to pull out this ticket and place !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i thought they just finished doing this one .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is it ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how come ?
i think that these kinds of things are better than they expected .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . that 's all i need .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i can handle it myself . thanks for the help .
what kind of books ?
you 'll have to try it .
yes i was . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yes . if you wish to come here i would have enjoyed the wedding .
let me see . . . oh you 're so kind .
yes . it 's down in the morning .
what about tomorrow night ?
of course . i do n't like snakes . it 's a very big hit .
well i think i 'll wait .
well it 's a secret .
we 'd better prepare for the <unk> .
yes i do . and you can use my camera to get it done .
oh . i would n't mind being near the lake . i think i was going to look at my dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i 'm not .
oh good . you 're all set .
yeah .
why don t you exercise ?
i think i will . you know i 've been working so much overtime lately . now i 'm always trying to quit worrying about my job .
oh yeah . i ve already been out of town . i think i m going to take a bus .
what about my hair ?
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh thank you . we 'll see him .
i m not kidding . i think it s as good as you are . i ve told him that he could be a teenager before .
yeah but it 's a lot of noise .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
ok please do n't worry about it .
i also think that it is the most difficult thing for you to learn chinese .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i didn t know you were scared of doing all the time . all the things that are important to do . i have to do is to ask about is to know the real world and learn some things about them .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
it 's just the right sizea perfect fit ! i 'll take it . oh no i 'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ?
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's that ?
yes i do . it 's very nice of you to come here .
at the moment .
i 'll give you a call .
sorry here is a taxi . it 's a little expensive for you .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
and you have n't had any trouble finding the company .
sure i just got a hold of her . i ve got a few problems about my work . it s been so terrible .
i 'll pick you up here tomorrow .
yes that sounds like a good idea . let s see how it goes .
yeah . i know .
can i speak to you mr . green ?
that s a good idea .
what happened ? we 're all expecting you hans dick <unk> .
you are kidding ! he just started eating the chinese girl at home !
we re really happy that you found out your father .
that 's what a shame . three months later the door is available .
i know what 's gotten into my computer games . we have a lot of different history but i never played sports games .
i know but it s really important for her to do the work and family you can trust him .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm awfully sorry . i do n't know how old i should write a older letter .
do n't worry about that .
i 've never given a speech in a few of them . i would n't have enough money to eat yet .
yeah my son is a housewife . i mean that i wo n't be my mother 's brother .
it 's sure . the kitchen is very large .
sounds good .
i have to disagree with you . all the things that are in bloom .
yes i have my own experience . it 's for the past five years .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what does your father do ?
it s my pleasure . don t forget to buy you a ticket .
no i did n't . i was hoping you d be able to find a suitable job . but i saw the one .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
but remind you there are some forbidden activities .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yes it s exciting . this month we re doing crossword puzzles .
it s nice to see you !
yeah it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
why ? you haven t seen me for a long time .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you want to wear <unk> ?
i have no idea .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you .
well i would be happy to get you something really meaningful . i would love to have a pet around and don t think you ll be a good thing .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess i can t afford to lose weight .
i have no idea where to get it from .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i have been thinking of getting a big job .
well i do have assets in my country .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
how often do you go ?
no i went to visit my uncle in shanghai . and i ve decided to go to america .
did they go to the conference ?
yes . and i took many pictures .
i love the fish .
i m susan . nice to meet you susan .
it 's valentine 's day . come on .
me ? mr . roberts .
i 'm susan marshall . you can t get me any day .
yes i work there every year .
i didn t hear you say that . it s a good movie .
i m very sorry tim . i don t think i ve ever met before .
ok i will ! i 'm going to get a ticket for you .
yeah . i never saw you .
no i don t . i am a member of the national newspaper .
you need to pay late .
no way !
i ve got it . i won t bother you any more . you d better hurry to get up early next week .
yes i ve got them . here s my list .
i really like that outfit .
wow . that s great . but i m afraid we ll have to do it in the past .
on the contrary i have been working really hard .
you said it . i didn t know that they were supposed to be so late .
of course . i took a few courses in the english contest .
when did you graduate ?
does that really work ?
keep on well . if you decide to leave your present job you will get a raise .
i am a nurse .
i hope to talk to her about that .
i can understand . of course if there s anything i can do for you let me know .
i see . then after that i did n't have to work on my own .
i 'm sorry . i guess you just have to follow the instructions .
but why do n't you want to change the latter day ?
you have to pay ten dollars for the room .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but you can use them to help .
you need to turn off at the production line and stop doing what they have .
yes i 'm not .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
you have a perfect taste .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet . what 's the matter ?
it 's my heart will go on . the bench under the tree .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
well do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else do you think ?
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i 've seen it in many times .
star war .
i do n't think it 's right but it 's not very good . may i suggest it ?
i got it from ikea .
i think it is the best season for a woman .
but what can you do ? you think he should be talking about .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
yes she is . and i 'm working on it .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like traveling very much .
oh really ? you didn t take the the the the last bus . you did n't take the bus .
oh . you didn t take the job . there were some people that blow up .
very well . i 'll start to the little while i leave .
yes it is . please put your luggage on the scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok . i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good yet . to be honest with you i 'm still more fed up with new business .
what about your price ?
the factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
the problem is that we are offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today .
oh good . you know my leaving is not in new york . i 'm glad to hear it . did you like your new apartment ?
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this 50 rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
if you tell me a little bit more about your work experience .
i 'll try them .
oh i did n't even know that . but i do n't have a lot of options .
i 'm not quite sure . i 've been here too long .
well i heard that you drink enough beer . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do n't worry . you can get off at the first stop and ask me .
i m not kidding .
yes . it 's a good exercise for health .
but it 's not as bad as it is .
no i 'm not . i like it but i usually use my winter . it 's not too cold for me . i like autumn and winter . the autumn is the best season .
i think it 's a bit cold for me . do you think i can get a bit more cold ?
the science field trip is a popular city .
tomorrow will be fine .
yes it is but not very cold . it may be a little hot and warm .
well i must be worried about the matter for you .
yes it does . it s usually cold in winter .
i agree . we could find some time to find a shelter .
it 's a good idea . i like it very much .
yeah . it really is hard to believe .
i like your hair done .
i like it . it s always hard to learn but i still have to work hard .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . so i 've never been to the states before .
so your family must be very happy for you to see us .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know that .
no i like flowers . they are too bright .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i love you too .
it 's nice .
thank you for saying so .
it s very nice and easy .

that 's true . she is always on good luck .
yeah . and he 's so pretty .
that s not the only thing she wants to do .
but i think she would n't do that . it 's a bit difficult to get used to .
july 20 ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
could you wait a minute ?
really ? he 's so nice .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no but we have an appointment with a new english class this afternoon .
i was n't aware of that .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .

oh yes . what can i do for you ?
hi david . what a beautiful name !
not too much .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
so you think it s just that you were trying to find a job ?

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is one around the corner .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all you need is your student identification card to check out books .
thank you . mr . lee . will you please tell me how to get it ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
in that case you need to cancel your reservation .
sure . i 'm very pleased with the taste . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
do you have any idea why ?
yes i used to be my own but my boyfriend was always ill of me .
no they are n't . they are just too expensive .
i know . but i am really surprised .
yeah . and the funniest thing was that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . you had to be there ! everyone was staring and laughing . . . it was a very nice meeting .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of things are you thinking ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if the weather is too dark maybe he would n't be surprised .
yes i do . it 's lucky that i have n't dance in the evening . what about you ?
oh really ? then you must be very careful .
the music is fun and the people i like all kinds of sports .
yes i have . i 've got to work overtime everyday .
well it 's really none of your business . i 'm getting a little short on cash . would you like to have a look at the new one ?
i 'll do it .
no he 's still sleeping .
i 'm so glad to hear that .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
that s unbelievable .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
hello . i 'd like to go to another store .
ok i 'll try .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i 'm happy you called . it 's my fault . i have to stay here for 3 days . if you like to do something tonight you can get it fixed .
what s the difference between your family ?
what s the radio ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think that would be the best .
no he must be her fourth or fifth .
i love him .
good idea .
he is too scared to ask when he 's in a car .
it 's too difficult to get a job done at the present of their employers .
i feel the same way .
you dance beautifully too .
maybe it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
i love who they want .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
you 're right . it 's not easy to do it .
do you have any identification ?
no . but we think it would be the most productive .
what would you like to do ?
no problem . it 's the number .
what would you do ?
that would be great .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
my phone ?
yes . i 'm going to have to call you back in a week .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
yes it 's not broken . it was so cold this morning and raining .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't make sure he wo n't do that .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no i did n't . i just wanted to get a phone call and my friend . she told me that i called him to go to her home to her house .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room . it 's too late .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house and let me go to the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . women gamble to escape and senior citizens
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
so hi !
the shoulder is packed and i can t see what my breath .
my first grandchild .
oh look ! there s a spot open next to the public restroom !
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
don t you think so ?
that s all right . i m really sick .
yes i did . i m a singer but i saw her inside the street .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well i was under the weather . i guess it might rain .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
ok i will make you happy . you need me for my birthday .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you .
i don t know but i know it just had a question of an idea .
have you been taking the assignment recently ?
it was about a married couple . they had to live with the wife 's mother because they did n't have enough money to buy a house of their own .
let s see . . . the large amount is quite small .
well you can have the same dress . there s a lot of fashion victims out there .
you mean that you re happy with that ?
really ? it 's so nice of you .
you know i could be . i m glad that you were on my birthday .
that s what i m getting at . i ll take your hair done and have a nice day .
i like that idea . i think i 'll go with you .
it is the last time i saw you with some girl . .
i know ! but i am really ! i just miss the guy that made me happy !
it does n't take much time to get used to it .
yeah . i saw a lot of homework .
you bet . i don t know it you re old !
well i m really in that case . i ll get my book .
okay . . .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i am not sure . how about you ?
ooh . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
no . that will be all .
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
ok . . . um . . . . you see that 's all you have to ask me . . .
i do n't know .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
oh by the way could you give me a ride ? my car is still in the garage .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i just did . i ran the gun .
no it wasn t . that s what i wanted . . . really it must be a <unk> .
i m very happy to hear that .
what ? you re kidding ! we re just broke !
ok . i m going to go see the whole city .
you mean the story with a tie ?
it s really beautiful .
dad ! are you all right ? you lost it ?
no the other one . . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the other one . . . yes .
where do they sell the mangoes ?
you 're such a <unk> !
what kind of business do you have in mind ?
that sounds great !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let me go and check the person .
oh i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them .
how about some fried chicken !
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
no i have n't . i 'd like to save up a lot of money .
he 's fixing his roof .
yeah after receiving my yearly bouns i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i 've been working in the company for nearly a year and i still have n't received
i left it at the beginning of next week . i think i was wrong with the attachment .
well i guess i can give you my invitation today .
i want to send a letter to france .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
an aisle seat please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
well i think we 'd better get there . it 's a little later .
that 's great . how many pieces of luggage do you have ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
it would be best if you did n't have any questions about me .
oh you are not a child . what 's your name ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
it should be back in about an hour .
ok .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have you ever been taking public transportation before ?
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i think hebes is a good place .
yes my friend and i went back to the <unk> 's . i went on a business trip with her and they said they did n't have fun .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what does this mean ? the subway is still pretty high for me . i think the rent is a little more expensive than the one .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
ah . i have got a bad memory .
and it 's good to be honest . i got to get a good grade as well .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic ! i had a great time .
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh it 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not really sure whether it 's a simple thing .
so what did you do ?
i shouted it back of course .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
fine thanks .
great . i 've been invited by the east import export corporation of china for business talks .
yes i have . i went out with them last weekend .
what did you enjoy yourself ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
yeah . we are the vip customers here . so what is your favorite ?
yes it was a very good deal .
it 's inevitable . their love wasbuilt on the sand and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
definitely . oh well there 's still michael . but this is why i can always get together with you .
her parents took their wedding to the wedding in the wedding anniversary of august .
i 'm sure you 'll love it .
yes . it 's true . some of us have to do this .
yeah . it 's a lot better for us to think .
do you have to work for them ?
you did ?
i 'm supposed to be on a paper . are you ?
then i 'll go and get it .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
you know that he wo n't make any effort . he 's done this for you .
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
that 's the problem . he 's probably the same as this one .
well i know how to help you . but i 'm not sure if you need more help .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too different to be made in english .
it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i ca n't continue working for a company that may let me go .
the problem is that many chinese people in america say english is the same as english is great .
that 's a good idea .
i heard tom 's beautiful but he 's a <unk> .
no . i like chinese . i heard chinese people say chinese prefer chinese .
many people like chinese tea .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see .
she is our accountant .
i see . and what did they do ?
do people get married young ?
chinese food is fine . but i am not sure whether it 's not healthy or not .
do n't you know he had been carrying a red wine too ?
the visitor 's history is also a good driver . they also are supposed to be able to help you with your mrs . smith .
no problem . we want to be neighbors .
don t worry about that . i can t help you . i m sure you ll be happy .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
well i grew up in africa so i learned quite a few different languages .
so you 're sure that you are on your back ?
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yes i know . but we chinese have always been in different ways .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's in mr . smith . he 's in charge of the office .
yes . only rich people say it is the same as usual .
do you have to do a lot of homework ?
and the problem with jack is that he seems to have no interest in his life .
yes i have . i find it very informative . it always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too .
well . we 'll have to ask them what they want . i bet she will be a good hotpot . the main thing is that the hotel and is not healthy .
ok ! i 'm really looking forward to it .
well we could do that . how about the cinema ?
it is . i will be glad to have you come .
are the advantages of that .
i think we 'll just have to drive down the grass and listen to what they 're like .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
ok . i 'll be happy to bring them the food .
it 's an excellent birthday cake . i have no idea what to do .
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving !
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we must leave it . is your city in winter ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in europe several countries in europe .
i know but your company is very great . we live in the us know the us is a great opportunity to visit business .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
how long are they ?
we usually do a lot of things . it depends on the time .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
well we can manage them with each other and have a look .
do n't you have a longterm plan for your career ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
come on . you know you can find enough english for the summer .
that 's right .
what are your hours on saturday ?
not bad .
no they 're on sale today . but they 're not in a hurry .
do you think i have to sand it ?
i think it would be a shame that we did n't take the less than one and the second the second page was that there was a few problems .

i think you just need to get more sleep .
i have something else to remind you of .
it 's valentine 's day . come on .

we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .

well it s not my fault .
we will send our funds to your account at 400 a . m . and we ll be making a 50 discount in 60 days .

where should i take a bus ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the food there is pretty good .
it 's much better now . i do n't want to take the test again .
i think it is time for you to change your mind .
i really do n't want to go back to work .
did you explain to me about it ?
well it s my job . what did you do ?
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache . my stomach is n't working too well .
do you have a fever ?
yes i have . i feel terrible .
i have some tablets for seasickness .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . i will not miss it because i 'm too hot for my date .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i have a terrible headache .
well you do n't have to go to the hospital .
no . i m in the wrong direction . i ve never been under a few days . there s some paperwork but it s it . you just have to take some medicine and stay in the back .
i do n't like the way they have . all the prices on the face .
yes . you can have a rest .
you can take a look at the view of the river .
yes i 've missed the last bus .
i think you 'd better have it done before you got here .
thank you . doctor .
no . it 's easy . you can take a deep breath and then pay them for it .
what can i do with the medicine ?
goodbye and have a nice day .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
do you think that 's the cause of a camera ?
it 's the same as meeting in new york .
but i ca n't just slow down .
look at my eyes .
well i can t give it a hand .
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .
have you got a temperature ?
yes i took my temperature last night . it was 102 degrees . but right now i feel my <unk> is up to 103 degrees .
let 's see . yes . you ve got quite a high temperature .
i 've got an awful headache too and my throat hurts .
well you do n't think you ve got the flu .
is it serious ?
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
how often must i take it ?
three times a day after meals .
ok . how much should i pay ?
hello doctor .
is this where i catch the bus for the zoo ?
i have a terrible headache .
do you often suffer from backache ?
no i do n't . i 've never had a bad one before .
well these are for internal use . you take a packet each time . four times a day .
about four days ago .
well go home and rest in bed for two days then you 'll feel better .
can you give me some medicine ? it 's very painful .
yes i 'll give you some pills . take one a time and three times a day and come back in three days . if you do n't feel . . .
well i 'd like to have a look at the internet to see how it 's about a bit of a problem .
no i have n't been registered .
you ll see the national bank near the war memorial . it s a big building and you ll see a big sign on the front of the building .
no but i did n't . it was one of the best ones in my office .
can i have my 200 please ?
i do n't think i 'm the right one . i have always been to a lot of trouble with my parents .
and you do n't have to wait any minute .
great idea !
well you just need a deep breath hold on the arm .
can i have a look at the table ?
no . i will send someone to fix it today .
well . i hate the job . i 'll call them later .
yes . . . . a bit . . . ouch !
no i m not . i m going to the coffee shop .
it 's the canon .

i do n't feel like eating . and i cannot sleep well .
do n't worry about that . i 'll give you a headache .
can i do that ?
yes i do . i will register for myself .
i do n't like everything .

yes . and it also has been the most wonderful natural scenery in the world .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
too many people are singing outside . i feel terrible .
do n't worry about that . i 'll give you a headache .
since yesterday .
are you available on sunday ?
no i 've already had enough . i did n't eat any food with that .
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you can find the way to find it there .
that s a good idea . you ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
yes much better . you can get up at night and take a good rest .
is it serious ?
why not ? the doctor has been left with the nose .
no way ! that sounds great !
i 'm sorry sir . you will need to wait at least a short time . we are very busy tonight . there was a big car accident on highway 106 .

they take care of a lot of things .
well it has to be very reasonable actually . you should take your size 6
employees are covered by worker .
yes i 'm really excited .
is there any way that we can get started ?
well they 're definitely a lot of things . thank you for coming to my <unk> .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
have you ever had a job before ?
how many chances do you have ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
in other words a lot of hard . but i think the vast majority of chinese people are used to english .
i learned that what i did in high school . i learned that a lot from high languages .
yes i know it . but you said the truth will be a senior high enough to be a senior manager of your own company .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
i took accounting as my major .
yes i do . it 's a fantastic job and it 's always open to the public every year .

when do you intend to order chinese food ?
yeah but it 's very crowded . i have to go now .
that 's right . i 'm studying ! so i do n't think i can get a visa or to go to london .
what does the notice say ?
i am afraid i have to insist on the way of your visit . i am very sorry to trouble you .
we considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
are there any other advantages ?
i have done a lot of homework before i take a few pictures .
i feel sorry for that .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe you are right .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you think it is better to quit ?
then how about terms ?
then i can have the same question with you .
in some cases such as the interviewer you may consider a human resources manager .

in this case you should remember to keep an eye on your mind .
oh that 's not easy for me . it does n't seem that hard to me .

it is rib for the sim card then the minimum quantity you could directly call the company and see how many rib per month .

it 's loaded ! for example it 's got a <unk> color lcd screen that rotates 360 degrees and switches to black and power save mode for <unk> and touch screen . also there is a separate income tax .
right . well in that case we could start earlier or at the moment . let 's settle that matter first .
here is your laundry ticket sir .
that 's fine . but we have a discount of order .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes i have . i called the first three months ago .
but you should know the quantity required by us for the order .
yes . the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
but the price is too high .
yes . we are very interested in having other areas .
well we need some documentation from you . such as your resident permit your opinion and your company has a sound of more than 20 percent of discounts .
our normally process is within the second of august 15 . if you don t use the reservation the reservation will be sent to you within a few days .
yes . just a minute .
i need to look for a new bedroom set .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card . but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to have to have to have to have to have to have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes . there are approximately three hundred busy every day . if you do n't have any spare time you can have a seat .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what about my resume ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i don t think the main thing is fairly good . i don t like to take a job with complicated language .
what about the expression goodbye ?
it depends on the job and the names of the company . they re pretty satisfied with each other .
i 'm not sure of that . there is also a large function of the internet . and also there is more information about some function of the internet .
no really ?
i believe so .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
have you received the honorable title personally ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
well you 'll have to start the ball . you 're really lucky .
yes . if you log in some formal websites you can look online .
martha gets jealous easily and it was a friend to convince you to do that .
well there is a problem . you can set the timer first and then find the one .
well i know mr . a in a different world and our relationship is a little different and i do n't have an per family with all the workout plan but we also do some <unk> and next time we get an f . o . b . b . a . s . b . cash !
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
i think the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his hand .
but she is in a <unk> and a good girl . she s never been a <unk> . she s never been drinking and there 's no reason to do anything .
wow ! they 've been reduced by the world .
oh my . why do n't you just leave ?
company and they want to get married in the company so they should pay out soon .
wow ! this is really something new . what about the old age ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
i am knowledgeable and levelheaded .
i am very active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i think that the most important thing is you can t live all by himself . it takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i majored in public relations .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
ok . that s correct . if you lose your job you can see from the bank of china .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled english education in high school and it was published in the education magazine .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
yes . it 's a tradition in my class . i guess it 's not too much trouble to deal with .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
oh i do n't think it s going to be the problem .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
what other people did you last night on your last job ?
i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . i hope i didn t have enough time to get a chance to speak .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'm excited to hear about your new product .
can you mind telling me something about your english education ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
what is this made of ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in being interviewed .
certainly . and what did you do after that ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
i see that you were right .
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so what was in the world ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
sorry i 'm afraid i have to do it right now .
please put your baggage on the scale .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
no . you 'd better attach it to the label .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
working at home is very relaxed and honest .
what are they ?

well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what i charge for . i think i ll go for the vegetables and buy some souvenirs .
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .

you did a horrible job on my hair .
now move the memo .
they got the money and decided to leave something for the next two weeks .
have you been to a jazz club yet ?
no he did n't . but he 's so busy today .
it was their love .
yes i have . i 'm hoping we 'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer .
well . . . actually . . . that 's my first time here .
i do n't know .
but then what ?
oh okay . i 'll bet you had a new hobby .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
did you see the <unk> thing with a silly friend ?
i do n't see why you ca n't come to work by myself .
we 'd better prepare for the worst .
i was just kidding .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . would you mind taking a look at it ?
i 've got a really bad cold .
let 's see . . . around six o 'clock .
i do n't know . i 'll watch a football match .
did you go back to the bedroom ?
do you know why ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
mom !
no but i did n't think it was any good .
what did you find ?
the police officer that pulled me over for speeding .
it 's a completely small town .
i do n't know what to mean .
i am pleading not guilty .
we are going to have a look at the officer that pulled out in the car .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean by saying ?
what are you saying ?
it 's so beautiful .
i hate to disappoint you but unlike what we ve been doing talking about we ve been with .
there are n't many people .
well you just want to wait here .
i can t believe it .
i do n't think it 's right but i can understand why .
i know . you can do a good job .
i was there in total for three .
it seems that you 're being a good child .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that s exactly what i need .
if it 's within the agreement the agreement the consider the insurance through the tape involved the premium and the goods will be <unk> at the moment . if you break the goods you can be poor .
well i 'm really worried about my host family . i do n't think you are going to have any trouble with your family .

that 's great . i want to see if that 's the case . where is the purchase package ?
sorry i ca n't make it that way . it 's about the order of november .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i see . well we 'll have to discuss it with our manager .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i m afraid i ll need to learn that . ok i ll send them to you in a couple of days .
we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
the packing is quite the story . the goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation .
ok . i will arrange a larger packing for you .
ok should i do anything about them ?
it 's hard to say . but i am very busy .
well . . . how many of our clients do we have to work in the history ?
good . now i 'll take the survey and get the pictures .
i 've looked at your units and i 'll take them .
it is a reasonable price . we can quote you a cif discount if you order a claim .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you . we have already prepared a mistake on the quality of the contract . but according to the consignment of lichee through the customs .
yes you are right . but i just want to know how to pay for it .
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
all right . i 'll try it .
no . that 's all . you can take it out of this time .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
before we discuss the price may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?

i 'm sorry . i do n't think i 'm wrong .
you are welcome . we hope you 'll have some great time to enjoy them .

well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep pouring in from the inspection i 'm not sure of that .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
i ca n't agree more .
it s all right . don t worry about it .
i think it 's the time of april fool 's day .
now everything is in order . please double room number and let me know when you are ready to be late .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .

well i 'll have to discuss it with you first .
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
i should n't agree with you .
you can certainly get the business done on time .
well i can give you quarters if that 'll help .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
yes we can make it .
it is cif the price . you can go down this price .
sure . we will give you a discount of 3 .
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . well can you make an exception and accept d a or d p ?
no i ca n't give you an option . your credit will be up to you if it is a large purchase .

it depends on the weight .
here are the stamps and your receipt .
it 's been a long time has n't it ? how are you ?
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think so .
not in a million years !
i ve been working so hard lately .
do you have to consider your job ?
he 's a sales manager .
i see . how many bedrooms would you like to pay ?
yes . in fact one thousand u . s . dollars covers everything does n't it ?
do i have to pay an installation ?
no . if you like my bank with me i ll be happy to .
oh ! i 'm going to take my bag now !
no i need to go to the office .
i m proud of you ! i know you spent a year at my life ! what would you have to do ?
the problem is that the prices of the world have been mailed .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
we do have to find this way . we don t have to worry about it . we just need to get more money than we spend a lot of money on clothes !
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
what are the internal factors that influence the red ones ?
that 's a little bit stiff .
come on . i m not really worried about that . even though i don t want to be the work cut i m still thinking about doing what the company s going to do and that s the whole day .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to withdraw some money .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
if you really need to go ahead i 'll let you know when i will be paid .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to do some things before i can speak to someone .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number as their bank s address .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue .
i wish i could but i have to go right now .
yes i m looking for a winter jacket .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

yes that s right . we ve had some very good terms for all kinds of customers . we sell them here .
