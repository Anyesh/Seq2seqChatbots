i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i appreciate that .
no but i am not sure if i can .
ok .
hi .

this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

could i pay by check ?
well that 's not to be a problem . which kind of fixed do you prefer time deposit or current ?
i appreciate that .
no but i am not sure if i can .
well you 'd better take a taxi .
can i have another try ?
i think a cab is better .
who s winning ?
sorry but she 's out .

i understand . but why wo n't you check my seat ?
yeah i think it 's time to move on .
look what a nice girl . thanks .
excuse me ?
please call the sure the number on the back of the person you want .
i want to see some of your information .
yes here you are . they are a 90 yuan .
well they 're not very fashionable you see . i think they 're ok .
i see .
fine . i 'll be expecting you around two .
i know it is the most popular drinks .
they 're probably pretty hungry . let 's go to the falls and have a look .
actually you should ask him to give you a call .
oh that sounds like a huge fan of him ! hey i know he used to be the kids .
good idea .
mmmm . . . this is delicious . i 'm afraid the silence of the play is not quite cheap .
yeah . i know . . . that 's why i thought i was thinking of buying some medicine . and i am thinking about buying some programs in my college .
where 's that ? was n't a lady with a third grade ?
what other kind of music do you like ?
we eat a lot of chicken pork and beef . you eat those meat a lot in your country too don t you ?
yes i have enough time to understand .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .

yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butchers i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
yeah i will . i have to buy a lot of things with my own eyes and a lot of things .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
get the one i 'll just go and get this one . i 'll take this one .
get the jam and butter while you are . um . . this is longer than the ones i 'll go with this .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
what else are you going to wear ?
do you have to pay an installation fee ?
yes . i am a double room on the table .
i can look at the computer .
it must be worrying about the job you see .
in that case i am afraid i have to pay a bill . please keep the better for it .
i 'm clear so far .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
let me go over there to have it .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
do you know that 's the place in the whole city ?
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
no . but now i like the price .
that 's strange . what was it ?
it was a 15 dollars .
ok i 'll take it . please wrap it for me and i 'll take it .
we have that available .
yes . . . i ve seen you as a couple of years .
how about a good exercise ?
about three times a week if i can .

we can figure that out the price up later .
no way !
it is unnecessary .

that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
i 'm so happy for you .
before we start do it then . let 's go straight and have a look .
you get off at the first shi da stop .
yes . i 'd like an italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles .
do you want it with everything ?
what kind of salad dressing would you like ?

i m sorry . mr . richard s not in town . but i d like to have a shampoo first .
oh yeah i ll have a beer please .
i am sorry . he 's already here for you .
yeah he is . he loves the girl very much .
if you were on your history you would be considered a statement of honor .
we did . but we went to a few video camera last week .
get on the phone right now . it might not be too late .
i 'll do that .
in the north there is a lot of things to be covered .
can i go during the week or can i go to the beach ?
no . that 's too big .
ok i see .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i have to get up early to get to work .
i do n't think so . it 's kind of you .
i 'll do my best .
of course . go straight down this road and turn left at the second intersection .
how far is it ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
how far is it ?
sorry but she 's out .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's down this street .
is it a long run to the station ?
actually i do n't have the slightest clue .
why do n't you try and give it up ?
no . it s only five minutes walk . you can t miss it .
i 'd like to take the train .
sorry but she 's out .
sorry but i m not really interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
really .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i don t care about that .
we all are looking for different things in an instructor . i hope i 've helped you .
are they ?
yes they re very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
good idea . i will think about it .
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the third floor . walk up and you 'll find it .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
oh yes . it 's just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that sounds good . they must be an australian british degree in english .
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes i had one of the best things to do . i love browsing through different items and <unk> having a party with them so that i can always train them to share .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing .
this one ? i can guess that s the whole thing she can look up . what about these ?
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you look very nice .
yes . i m looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee .
this is kevin .
no . i 'm not really sure i need to .
hey look . that 's a great idea .

i 'll take one .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .

a bedroom is a little more expensive .
may i have a glass of red wine please ?
what kind of salad do you want ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea .
i 'll have a sandwich and small fries . would you like to have some desserts ?
845 lincoln avenue .

yes i will .
that s fantastic . thank you for your concern .
i will see you in a minute .
why not have a visit to the zoo ?
well since you agree with me we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
well i have nothing else to do with it .
well how long do you want me to stay ?
ok i will buy it for you .
why do you hate to go outside ?
alright .
i am cooking now . i will have a cup of coffee .
what about the red wine ?
yes . it 's a traditional chinese food .
this morning we rented a car and we are on the way to <unk> falls . i 'm afraid we have a car accident near the border .
i know a place that has great mechanical design and it has a few specialty of mine .
i want to have a try .
oh around 3pm .
that 's great .
all right . how many years of places have you been in an ericsson china ?
sure i 've been there but they are n't all that busy .
i see . i heard about the subway stations in london .
what 's that ?
that 's something that you really need to work on .
i know i ca n't believe it . it 's a good thing for me to pay for the u . s . dollars to buy some stuff .
of course i have ! i just bought this house and it is really large !
the most important thing is that the first time they are on the 268 .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes on the streets .
i believe it 'll be very expensive .
i agree how much ?
the problem is that the end of the year for the first six months .
sure i 'll have a glass of wine .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
stirred or shaken ?
where is the fitting room ?
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you looking for ?
do you think you can get me there seven thirty ?
enjoy yourself .
i 've come to make sure that your stay here is on time .
actually i do n't like cooking but i 'm sure i 'll get used to it .
i like mmm . . do you have a favorite ?
well i have to write the proposal . i 'm pretty excited about it .
i do n't think i can choose any kind of vegetable .
a coffee would be nice with some dessert .
are you kidding ? i ca n't believe what are you doing !
yup they have good french fries as well . they are very <unk> .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
well i 'm sure it 's the time for you guys .
are you going to cook anything ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it is a good idea to have a vegetarian diet . i have more time to eat !
oh yes . that 's a place to go to collect food .
cool ! what 's that ?
ok . i will go now .
thanks . sorry . there s no subway in the package .
i 'm so happy for you .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you think that 's a good idea for you to try some day ?
what do you mean by something ?
not really . they will have a lot of fun there . do you know the four places of interest ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
i think its critical advantage lies in its low cost .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry . maybe you were just emotional at that moment .
you are right . the economy is great .
like what ?
okay . that 's good .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well let me check again under a different heading .
it sounds interesting .
this soup has two tablets .
are you scared of anything ?
we are terribly sorry for that . we will refund the cost and send you a receipt to your room .
how do you plan on going ?
may i know what you do ?
alright . have you been to any particular brand ?
do you know what the problem is ?
what did you say ?
my husband said he had an office that he could become an artist like <unk> .
some more chinese tea for us please .
it 's all right . we will go to see you then .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
that 's good to hear .
just let 's do it .
ok .
yes . i 've got to drive .
yes it is . you wo n't be able to make your own decisions here .
sounds like a good idea . she is very serious and fun .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
well i 'm not finished . i 'm planning to discuss the table .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
ok . she will be back later .
so you have a plan on your own desk .
what does she look like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you can wait . your name is greg and i can assure you it will never happen again .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
mr . smith please i m here to confirm the client .
is everything in the fridge leftovers ? i hate leftovers !

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah i know what you mean . that 's why i am running .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fifty dollars .
well i guess you 're right .
well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yes that 's right . we just need to give you the receipt .
no . it 's very simple . you can use a credit card to withdraw the money in japan .
ok . here 's the money .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .

no let 's go on saturday .

you 're right .
it 's a pity that i can also get a <unk> suit with my wife . do you have any ideas ?
what 's the rent ?
it 's comfortable . i 'm kind of never used an emergency system to pay . it is only good but it 's also a little expensive .
it 's beautiful .
i do n't want it to be fancy .
i said that you are a new teacher .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
a magic love seat ? oh i see . when did you begin to the gym ?
what ? i wish i could but i 'm afraid i would n't have to do anything .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i just hope so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
how about a little bit ?
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
that is a great idea .
you re welcome . the rain is quite heavy isn t it ?
yes please . is there a problem ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
well when do you have it in the afternoon ?
could you also bring me your driver 's license ?
your flight takes off at 8
we can do that .
we will thanks .
yes that 's all you have to do .
i will pick you up then .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
the machine in this store is in front of the store .
mangoes ? what are mangoes ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
i have to tell you the truth . i 'm not sure whether we could ask you that one of the best things .
20 a dozen .
what if i were you in a hurry ?
no i do n't like them . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
yeah they are quite fashionable . but they were on success at that time .
where do you think they sell them ?
look nice fresh cherries ! they are ripe and soft . i 'll take some .
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
these are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?

well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags power steering and power windows <unk> windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
sounds a very good idea . but how do you think it will be ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
all right . . .
there are some of our expenses so we will have to work in the future .
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .
don t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .
yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher and trash compacter .

i need some cash back .
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
sure . i think this kind of boring boring boring job is to change even though i 'm not sure what 's going to happen .

i did n't hear anything about that .
let me see if i can do that .

well i like hot food too .
i would like to have a try .
well you can have a look at the cell phone . i can listen to music while you 're watching it .
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes block . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . it takes us almost 1 hour to get to school . can you see the city ?
i am happy to have a good chance to taste the best .
ok .
i m not sure if you can stay in this city .
that s it .
here is the train .
that 's terrible !
oh how awful ! it 's just a movie .
that s great ! i m glad we can do something outdoors .
well do you want to tell me something about the latest ?
i 've never tasted anything like that .
i see .
i would rather you ask her anything .
oh i see . i m sure he can find it . let s go together .
oh yeah . i remember when we were in england .
are you going to take a similar trip ?
i think something must be done .
is it far ?
come on over at ten .
do you know where you 're going to find your living place ?
well . it s very interesting .
i know . but it s my hard work .
ok . there 's an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a few things about the costs of my own country .
congratulations ! that s almost the lowest price i can offer .
i should be aware of that .
do you have a car in the house ?
good idea . i ll send a check if it s not available .
where to sir ?
please take me to this address .
is it furnished ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
ok see you then .
actually i need an economy ticket .
if we get stuck in traffic again you will have to wait for about half an hour .
here 's twenty dollars .
only 2100 ?
oh i see .
here 's your change .
yeah i ll give it to you in a minute .
where will you go sir ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
ok . i need your name please .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
how much is the ticket for ?
here is 4 dollars . keep the change .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
you are kidding !
that is a good choice .
ok i am sorry .
i 'd better get back to work before i leave .
hello debbie . this is donald .
sure . take a seat .
thank you . your order will be ready seven days from now .
yes i am . i really need to learn about the things you 've just come .
what would you like for a drink ?
no way ! i m afraid i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .
ok . what did you do ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just one of those houses . if you do n't want to see the sign on the right .
ok . thank you .
i see .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's mrs . thou when she moved in .
fine . are you coming for the interview as a secretary ?
i 've been working too .
if you really do n't get the promotion what will it be ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh you are a good mother .
i would like to make one right now .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i began to went there last month .
i think we will be there .
she 's handsome . what 's he like ?
but what does she think about ?
yeah i 'm very excited .
hmm . . . that might be a good idea . but i know you have a long history to work in the field .
but that 's great !
for how many people ?
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you are going to have to clean your car before we start to use the car .
when i put what i can t because i was browsing the accident .
ok . . . i know . but you mustn t leave it too long . . .
what does that mean ?
whoa ! don t you know what ? i m awesome !
well . . . you can get used to it . i mean not to play really well . . .
mom i 'll be finished soon .
there s no use . i know the laws of the road .
yes . could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in germany ?
what ? in that case you should pay for it .
i d like to have a try . do you have a pet ?
you have a lot of money .
so you must be pretty interested in photography then .
no i don t want to be caught in a hurry .
i do n't like this kind of 9 . 5 minutes later it 's done .
oh i see . and how many honors does it have ?
here it is . the restaurant is on the second floor . please watch it for me .
i don t like the play .
wait a minute you 're from the factory .
i don t really want to have the money . but what about the mobile ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
no . i have a little problem .
what s the bad news ?
thanks . see you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . if you are sure we could get on the right bus .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> for our dinner .
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
don t worry . i ll see you back in a few minutes .
i 'd like a bottle of juice .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you like red roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we have a great time for a picnic ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
i 'm ask for a pizza please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had a very important project to be given up on we had to work with .
perhaps we could just stay in the airport .
oh good come on in please . i m leaving tomorrow . are you ok ?
i can t believe it ! it s so terrible . i just ca n't believe it ! why don t i just go and see the bookstore ?
ok come on in please . didn t you hear me today ?
i think the best way i can do is to finish the magazine .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are several kinds of seats in that size . do you have a bigger size ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now if you re in the proof i ll just sign here .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you should rent a car with a sound .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen . there s the dirty house .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
where can i find it ?
can i have the ticket please ?
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s not enough .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
well i just wasn t .
well i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i don t think i can get a better price than eating . it s always good for me to eat a lot of people don t mind .
no i have n't . i 'm sure the restaurant is very tasty . but it 's difficult to cook a good thing to me .
it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
okay . do you have anything else ?
maybe a little too .
i see . what size do you wear ?
maybe you have a point .
my husband is going to get her 3 dollars early so i don t want to get him something else .
all right . i m going to cut it off and it s no good on the way to get this .
i can ring you up at the register for you . do you want to buy one of our large quantity ?
the large one please .
all right . anything else ?
i prefer a casual style .
i agree with you .
sir your bread is brought up the <unk> bed .
i am the apartment manager .
i 'm interested in the position of pr manager .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's very interesting . i would like to have a try .
oh how much is the rent for this apartment ?
good . i will see you then .
can you show me your key and room number ?
i think that you can give me directions to the restaurant .
why do n't you go up ?
should i bring anything with me ?
you 'd better bring us a bottle of wine .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i have been thinking about getting rid of the old ones . i have to wear red dress at the store . it 's very nice .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
good . ok . i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i think that i would like to try it .
okay what s on the kitchen ?
what about cash ?
if i were you i would take a few days off before you move in .
good idea . i think that s the problem . i can manage it by tomorrow .
oh look they have a nice view of the window .
will there be any extra income that you need to deposit a deposit ?
i am sure i will .
we have a very large house . there are about 10 of them .
that is the best part . it is the best part of you make a decision .
ok . and do you want me to put it in a safe place ?
i know what you mean .
i don t know . let me see .
it 's a manmade wonder . i 've seen it many times in textbooks and it 's part of my dream to get rid of my stay here .
i love my walking ! how many pieces of hand luggage is that ?
let 's take the kitchen .
ok . i will make a note of it .
that s what i charge .
i am the apartment manager . what can i do for you ?
hello this is bob . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
oh that 's convenient . the apartment is too small for me .
i can help you pack . you can contact me up if you like .
let s go .
yes . i 've got to attend the meeting in london .
that 's great . this is your key . if you need anything just dial 0 .
no i 'm a tourist .
we have a deal then .
that 's fine . i 'll be there right now .
i do n't need to see anything else .
yes . i m looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it 's very important for you .
i am sure you can give me some advice .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . we can talk about software later if you have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
well thanks for the understanding .
that sounds reasonable .
what would you like for a drink ?
yeah i just got the money . that 's my first time to move .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just a little tired .
what would you like for a drink ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
that 's a great school .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .

i haven t seen you for several days .

too bad . i ll send someone to pick up the store .
it is hard for me to believe but i would n't have any other outside ones .
i 'd like to try to arrange a letter for you . as a rule i can do that with the clients .

under the sign for the gas station there will be a smaller sign that says selfserve or fullservice . and some gas stations have both . but if they have both some pumps will be selfserve and some will be <unk> . you have to look at the signs .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my wife and i are leaving for work on the office this week . she was n't there for the first time .

i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
can i leave a message ?
no i don t . i like bus .
you have your own vehicle ?

what s on ?
i ca n't afford it .
i 'm sure you 'll have to walk .
we can get off at the zoo station .
what do you think we should do something else ?
i think it 's a bit difficult to drive .
how long are you going to stay there ?
it 's too far . let 's drive .
why do n't you make yourself a sandwich or something ?
yes i got it .
is there a chance you get lost ?
i 'm serious .

i 've been in the bank for the last ten years .

i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
you see !
i want to tell you that i 've put in notice .
i have done a lot of work in the office .
i think i want to try a new style .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well then i will clean it up .
what kind of soup ?
i have a terrible headache .
it 's really healthy to do it .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .

did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
i think so too .
well i feel better when i hear what he was talking about .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
wow . you 're lucky .
i took a lot of things about myself and took a year to get some experience .
so what was you responsible for ?
i know . but i have to start . i ca n't stand my job at the moment . and i have to go to two hours a day to get through .
actually i have to disagree with you . all the other choices are on the shelf .
no . well it was in the third grade of my class .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting this week .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?

i heard that she is also a famous student .
i think you 've got a great idea . our decision is very popular with our offer .
she 's going to be my manager .

it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
of course . when you eat your eggs and soldiers .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . i hate to disappoint you . but i think he s really good at the long line .

are you kidding ? that 's a <unk> !
yes it 's not very far from here . it 's near the square .

i see . i remember that we used to have a similar team in a team when i was working as a team .
i can help you with that . i think we can work something out .
maybe you re right .
i can t wait to get that done .
so what did you do ? do you have some things to buy ?
i think you re right . there s nothing wrong with the design . i think that s true but i m afraid the marketing will soon affect most of the world .
that s no good to hear . you can trust him .
i have been having trouble breathing lately .
you are welcome . please press that button if you need any help .
i want to see some of the famous places like eiffel tower the seine river . . .

it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
here s the thing i ve ever had . . just go and see the shark .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
get some eggs milk and bread .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
oh yeah . the southern part of the country is just the advantage of it .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

yes . i have worked in the personnel market for five years and i want to get a promotion .
how did you do it ?
actually it 's ok .
if you make an appointment with a job counselor they can also provide you with a lot of information .
i will improve my english .

i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
if you do n't mind may we put it off to the next day ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
thanks . anything else ?
yes . it 's a very famous brand .
what 's the number ?
well i just want to enjoy the rest of the day .
what about guessing games ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me . if we go on a hiking trip i 'll be able to go in the frame of fun .
good . let 's go now .
how are you going to catch up ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
well i do n't feel so good .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
we should probably have the same with our new audience .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
yeah i 'm terribly sorry .
it was boring . i didn t just sleep until i heard about them .
must i catch a cold .
sure . what can i do for you ?
i 'm looking for a leather belt for my husband .
oh never mind . what 's wrong with that ?
my check for 100 bounced .
do you have a car tomorrow ?
i 'm talking to you .
ok . do you want your steak ?
i need a quick one for my daughter .
here 's your store 's brought you a lot of money . could you order it for me ?
<unk> bean would be my first choice but it 's too small for me .
we will have an appointment in half an hour .
ok . i 'll have another glass of wine .
that 's right . i will get them back in a couple of days .
sure . what comes with this camera ?
actually you can save a lot of money in this way .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let me see . that s after i got married there .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
that 's right . i want to go to the bank to have some sound .
sorry . you have to take the money .
yes i think so . it 's very nice of you to say so .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi this is emily wang .
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have already drove down a business connection . it 's our fault .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
don t worry about it .
you mean i am not going to be the fault of this ?
thank you for your concern .
oh that 's easy . do you know there are a lot of things to get there ?
does it mean that you can find some time to come in at 7 thirty ?
yeah i 'm glad you came .
did you get a new roommate ?
well i know . . i 'm just waiting for the job to get this pretty quick .
sure . but you know our price is superior .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening ! what about our hours ?
i just want to have a different color carpet .
my family are ill for me .
that s a great idea . you ve had a lot of experience in the office . i m sure you ll do well .
i will have to try it later .
i love you as well .
hey honey i know you 're so crazy .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
could i have a look at your battery ?
great ! oh what s that ?
will we be there soon ?
i need to get there before ten .
oh you do ? don t worry .
what about the car over there ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
i am sure i will have a good time !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
no he s just like a home .
and a company car .
well it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
how about going for swim around 10
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! now what about you ? how do you like the game ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m not too happy about that .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
hey i m sorry . i know we re going to have to cut back on our feet !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
well if you get an outside line please .
well you are changed !
what are you talking about ? you probably just wear a little scarf and some jeans . but i am also getting a little short .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m not a cheater . i know you never would never happen again . i m just . .
many people are my favourite dances .
you mean i have to dress up like this ? i just want to get rid of what i m really looking for .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i do n't know . maybe it 's just one of those things .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? what about those <unk> you ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
it 's not the end of the world .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes but i still have n't jumped off anything in my mind . i just finished the door .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i am not the only one who had the best friend . i know you have done a good job . but you should be there is always a big chance to learn how to move into the world .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . i 've decided to go to a movie this time .
ok . let 's go then !
oh i enjoy what you 've done . the study i love the job so i ca n't afford to pay for my own .
i think your qualifications is the most important thing for me .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
you 'll have to come here to the station and buy a ticket .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
oh i m sorry .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
that 's too bad .
i 've got to get dressed .
oh that 's my grandmother 's favorite . she said you were really a hard time .
you 're such a big child !
you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he has a girlfriend last week .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
his new girlfriend is running a car .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
you can keep a low profile .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what 's the matter ? you will be happy with it .
yes it is .
good idea .
on the level ?
why not ? i do n't like to go by myself .
in the middle of the summer it should n't rain today .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really like swim ?
i love you too .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to think of it for some time .
i 'm ok so far .
i do n't care .
ok ! i 'll do my best .
i promise .
how about tomorrow night ?
thanks for everything .
i 'm sorry .
some more chinese tea for us please .
why ? what 's wrong ?
i feel that the same way as those people in the first year of year .
great . i hope so .
i feel they 've got a life together .
not much . i 'm just watching tv .
i am tired of doing that boring work .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
you 're right . it 's just that the job of the company is so old . and what is your name ?
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't think i have to wear a little makeup .
honey it s done .
i 'm going to sweep the floor first .
sure the huanghe carp with sugar and vinegar is famous in our restaurant .
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
ok . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm so happy for you .
we have to wait for the next bus .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
and about time too !
yes it is . there are many people living here .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
you should n't have used an english word with it .
these books over here are a history . can you show me the catalogue ?
yes i did . my parents and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . how about you ?
i ca n't miss it .
i m not sure .
how sweet .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
can you give me a discount ?
no joke !
i don t think they are right . they re so important .
but you re not allowed to watch so that we can learn more about it .
the one with a nice piece is that the one on the left .
i do n't know . . .
well what about this one ? it 's a very famous chinese brand .
you re right . it s too bad for me to play table tennis .
uh . . . please do n't tell me about a software .
no i have n't .
i quit work very hard .
i like spring .
it is hard to get outside . why do n't you go outside and have a look ?
you re right . what kind of sports do you like to go with yourself ?
what 's montreal like ?
this is the best family .
but our summer is specially designed for the season .
you should have a good memory . what 's the matter ?
why ? are you going to try it ?
i do n't understand .
in the second week i was a bit disappointed . i really enjoyed my time together .
well done ! i can understand why you come here several year . the mountain of over there is so beautiful . i can t wait to try it out .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh no . when i left my home from work i was too nervous . by the way can i tell you more ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh do you know the ones who stole my wallet ?
i 'm serious .
if you can listen to some of them .
sure what will you do if you want to read these books ?
that 's ok . the <unk> is about to speak .
actually it 's the first two of us .
so what ?
yes i 'm just so successful .
ok ! i feel like sitting down the next day .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i was learning english when i was in primary school .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
i bet . he is only a joke about me . he 's a bit crazy .
i 'm sure it 's not a local on the internet . i 'm usually more than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
oh dad i see .
the interesting picture was very interesting but i can t find it .
of course not it should be back on .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh come on ! do n't be so pathetic .
he 's a bit nervous i guess . what 's he like ?
what about it ?
well i think you should do something else . maybe he likes it .
he must be really happy with your work experience .
maybe . i 'm from taiwan . when i was a kid i 'd better get a promotion .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we sing happy birthday and have a happy birthday party for us .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
ok . is there anything else ?
yes . but she is very lovely too .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
i 've never seen you so worked up .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
sounds like fun . then i 'll go and get a drink .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
why do n't you make yourself a sandwich or something ?
none of your mind .
oh i do n't have any plans that i have n't thought about .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at a university i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
who is the head of your family ?
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
well maybe you can choose from a really good impression on them .
ok . so you 'll be very happy to learn english to learn .
it 's a simple question . you know we usually do n't have a trademark like a very dangerous place .
i see .
well i do n't know .
what if you saw the program ?
i do n't think it 's broken . the battery life insurance that comes with no damage . but it 's not all . the damage is that the water is in this city .
i m crazy about him .
really ? i want to go too .
8 . they are all three . and they 're production another .
i see . the first round was the match between the two .
i sure will .
it was n't just that bad .
i know ! but i could not believe it !
yes . the scenery there is often falling apart and the cat is falling apart .
how could it be ?
no sir . the gas station is still in .
no . the hills ?
ok . i 'll put it on .
that 's true . and this trip has been a very productive one for us .
i guess he is . he is just an independent player and a lot of guys do n't even have to keep a better time .
you are right . i started to eat a little . what about you ?
absolutely . i love to play <unk> games like this .
you are right . for the sake of life is not all that good .
i have heard that few people say that there are always a big generation of cooperation .
i do n't know .
what a lucky man !
she 's my roommate 's having a party .
sure .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
now let 's see .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
oh i know .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello is doris available ?
my name is jessica . what about you ?
what 's your name and phone number ?
ping . ping .
i 'll give you mine too .
i 'm from canada .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t know . i took the boat race and went swimming .
how long have you been feeling ill ?
the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
just watching some tv .
not much . i 've been pretty busy lately .
that 's the only thing .
that 's really a good game .
i know . he just broke up with ann .
i must tell you that because this is going to be my first day for the night .
it 's a good idea .
it 's true . he just broke up with me .
i 'll do that .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
seventy to sixtyseven .
i do n't know . but i think he 's a brilliant guy .
oh that 's a good idea .
why ca n't we get the phone fixed ?
you 're right . this one costs less but it 's much better than the others .
yeah . but his wife was having a baby so i called her to help her with the girl .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
what if i visit them ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are having a bad cold .
i 'm really into video games . i thought i 'd come and see you then .
that sounds great . could i buy a chinese restaurant or a local one ?
i am glad to meet you too .
it 's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk .
oh i see . then you 're not going to miss the plane .
good luck !
thank you . i will .
i plan on going back to school .
you 'll never be disappointed .
no thank you !
i did n't want to be watched football .
have you ever thought about it ?
yes it was . but i missed the subway because the subway was too expensive .
but we still need a lot of people .
hello !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's mrs . thou when she moved in .
fine . are you coming for the interview as a secretary ?
i 've been working too .
if you really do n't get the promotion what will it be ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh you are a good mother .
i would like to make one right now .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i began to went there last month .
i think we will be there .
she 's handsome . what 's he like ?
but what does she think about ?
yeah i 'm very excited .
hmm . . . that might be a good idea . but i know you have a long history to work in the field .
but that 's great !
for how many people ?
i 'll be there .
i 'm trying to become music .
i like all kinds of music .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to live in the movies . there are so many attractions and they all sound interesting .
yes i like them too . i m not sure if they are good . i ll take them to the department .
it should n't be a problem .
no . i wanted to get a pair of classic elvis records .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
it 's true . however you must be careful with the rest of the day .
we had a difference of opinion .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i just saw a few weeks ago . it 's all going to be a very exciting party for my family .
which john ? mr . turnbow s son ?
what would you like for a drink ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
my god ! he 's so terrible .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
your sister did ? how old is your uncle ?
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
that must be wonderful !
they 're on the other side of the city .
i do n't know . a sister is a baby .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i do n't think so . i think it 's either you or not .
he took the money and tried to get away .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman and why mary does n't marry him since he 's much more attractive .
oh that 's a very good idea . let 's take a look .
well i 'm not good at all . we should listen to the music watch movies .
great ! i 'll sing and you can dance in our band .
he 's all good . you 're a big fan of him !
you will get it .
that 's fine . i 'll have my passport and everything is fine .
that sounds really good . i will bring the sample .
we were in the same science class last term . we had a big meeting with other people .
oh yes . i 'll be glad to go .
no . . . she looks quite depressed .
i had a very big problem with a guy but he was not very serious .
have you fallen in love ?
you know she is my girlfriend . i 'm thinking of something .
i had a few coffees while i was in the shower . he was a very good fit for me .
i think that he had a too much of a choice .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly is ! now you are my favorite !
see you later !
well it is hard to say . thank you .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . i know i am really excited .
yeah . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm ok ?
ok .
see you !
that 's the one i 'm afraid .
that 's interesting . what does your friend do ?
and it 's called counter strike . it 's the moon cake and the cake is called the moon cake !
why does it come to china ?
no most of the students do n't have to pay for food .
do n't worry . i have thought we can work something together . i think we can work together together together .
i know . but if you can get this dress that might be lovely .
it 's a good idea . i 'll have to get a ticket for you .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
what 's on this weekend ?
i have a friend who is going to be the next president .
yes . take a return bus for example . it s interesting in writing .
there is one just around the corner .
what did you do ?
the party starts at 8
fine . that s a good idea .
i just hope that you do n't have any food .
i am in the car now .
okay . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
are you sure you 're not reading too much into a house alone ?
oh yes . your wife 's car is a gift . i want to get her something to drink .
oh you like the way that i think i 've been looking for some time .
i love it . it 's a great pleasure . thanks for your help .
so i have to talk to my boss about it .
sure . it 's a famous restaurant called the china 's <unk> . it 's a very famous place for its sake .
great . i 'll have to finish this report and get it ready .
i never thought about it that way . do you know the details of our company ?
do you have any other special events in your new year ?
oh to be frank i am not now .
no way ! they are dangerous ! but they are n't even allowed to go to school anymore .
i see . but why do n't you ask them to buy a new balance ?
my father and i are a cooking expert . he says it 's a traditional chinese tradition .
the brazilian team will be driving the van .
oh that 's great . we can also hear the dragon boat race and many restaurants and ornaments . by the way do you have in mind ?
what time would you like us to deliver the balance ?
can you speed up and let me have it today ?
what about the olympic park ?
well i think ac milan is on the east side of the city .
i 've never had any idea about it .
i said he would cool me .
what else is it ?
yeah ! i got offered a new job !
cool ! anything else ?
you can use the <unk> paper or any bulletin boards .
it should be 3
well . i like to attend your graduation school and have a good time .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
my pleasure . well then see you tomorrow evening .
you 'd better tell your friend .
sure i am . who is the director of the movie ?
well i see . the difference between the two countries and the other is still a big fan of the two quarters .
it 's 150 .
it sounds interesting . is it expensive ?
yes . i need to borrow the car and draw it back .
i do n't think that place is very expensive if you live with your parents .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's up ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've never had any problems so far . is that a good idea ?
i hope you will have good luck .
thanks . i love it .
that 's the reason it was such a great game .
well . i really do n't know why you 're so excellent !
have you booked the hotel for lunch ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
you are flattering me .
i do .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
it is such a nice place .
it 's my pleasure .
no i 'm full .
it 's a deal .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh i 'm afraid that 's the time for the flight . i 'll come back to the office at 12 am .
look closely at the five men in this lineup .
i think it 's amazing . i ca n't wait to see it in the refrigerator .
oh no . i hate to go to the conference center of the day . i think it 's time to get to go to the foreign teachers .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
yeah i went shopping .
good . have you brought your credentials ?
no because i did n't .
did you join the <unk> party of china cpc ?
it was nice talking to you too .
it s nice to meet you too .
in that case i 'll be back in a minute .
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no . it 's all yours .
my iq score is slightly above average .
i 'm afraid so . i 'm staying here for a few weeks .
tim please . please be seated .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's my favorite .
no i do n't . i 'm in a hurry .
oh yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join a dance ?
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
sounds interesting !
not really . the ancient olympics originated in the world . the read in ancient olympics were used in the <unk> prince .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think this critical of us . that 's the reason for its popularity . many of the family have been <unk> for the past few years .
that sounds interesting .
let me see . . . i think the volume of the way to the production line is on the right side .
this is delicious ! we ca n't just play on the top of each .
it 's a great idea . i 'm looking for a place to live .
yes in this position i was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . with the different initiatives that we implemented we lowered our <unk> rate to about five percent which had a direct impact on revenue .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good . i m glad you can dance .
now let 's go and see what we have .
thanks . who do you think about this ?
then i 'll listen to the music . is n't it ?
yes i do . i 've had enough to get a scholarship in the end .
you re a good dancer . you know i still play video games .
you 're a good dancer .
then you must be a singer .
yes . it 's very nice .
let me show you how . you are in love .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course . but i 'm not much of a dancer . .
oh in the bank of the people .
i think it 's a good idea to relax .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
sure . i 'll take it .
yes . you know i like to play soccer games with people .
you said it .
a disco ? oh yes you know a good memory .
what about a game of bridge ?
you 're a real fan of disco .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love to dance the fast music .
well i love you too .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
i 'd like to taste <unk> chess .
then what do you think about tea ?
yes it is .
oh i see . . . this is n't a beautiful city . i do n't think i 'm a little bit of a jealous . what can i do ?
yes of course ! this is the one i have ever watched it .
what makes you think so ?
well it 's raining cats and dogs .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
that s a good idea
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
hmm . . . i think i can find it .
thank you for the picnic too . it was not like this .
me too . i ca n't wait to go out anyway .
yes it is . the sun is shining . there is a wet breeze so it is not like a hot breeze so it is not hot .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
how come ?
it 's pretty bad . but i think it 's going to be a little warmer tomorrow .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
yes it usually does .
i ve heard that it is a good idea to get some information from our office .
is it cold in winter ?
i like your fish .
yes that 's true . i 've heard that the sun is shining and there are a lot of people there .
no . i 'm from guangzhou . i 'm from guangzhou .
you look so young .
well it s sometimes not for me .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
no problem . i 'm really glad i did n't get too much sleep .
if have time i 'll come again .
i 'm glad you like it .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
next week .
you are welcome . please give me a call when you have time .
that 's fine . i do n't mind .
yes . i m going to look at it . are you ?
this is the best time for you to yourself .
i 'd love to .
please take me to the airport .
oh that 's interesting .
this afternoon .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
my wife and i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
my car is simply a daisy but they do n't do anything . it 's just as affectionate as yours .
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . my wife and i just like that . my wife would be very happy to hear that .
well my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night but he never did .
i 'm not used to it .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let me tell you why . you 're just a common cold .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he do something wrong ?
you do n't think he is talking about anything .
is he getting better now ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
i am very sorry sir . but may i have your name and phone number please ? i have to go now .
yes we never did .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? that is a wonderful gift .
yes he 's very handsome i think .
i see . please have a seat .
i 'm waiting for our president to lower the gas prices .
i guess you 're right . last time i saw a big chicken . . .
you 're right i 'll never do that .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date with you .
well . . . actually we have some good terms for you .
this time ?
i 'm afraid that my wife will be back at about seven .
we would love to but you know our products better . and our company has always been very busy .
they re both listed on the declaration .
i will tell you .
no i am the only child in my family .
yes it is . i 'm very busy now .
oh i see . when did you get your passport ?
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me any time you need .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me any time you need .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
do n't mention it . see you .
not bad . but i 'm sure she wo n't be able to find something similar in her bedroom .
i m sorry . but i don t like her .
you re kidding . she looks like a lot of girls in the do .
that is true . but i think women like like her .
ok well it s always open to our home office . i have to pick up a new home at the airport and take care of it .
i 'd like to try that back back to circulation but i 'd like to be in the back of the house .
ok . well in that case you can use the computers .
oh you 're right . but it 's hard to say .
you should attend a attend a attend monday morning and swimming . it is very important to you .
i think you can save a lot of money .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and let 's have a look at the menu . oh yes . the price is 36 . 00 .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes i did . it s a very interesting job .
dear . you should n't be afraid .
yes where do you want to go ?
of course i am . but what about the data ?
oh dear let me see .
yes . you must have seen one .
no but i am on my way to the top of the baby .
i 'm sorry .
very interesting . so it was quite an adventurous childhood .
yes . but we used to have a few desks at the annual meeting and then we found a big feast for the next year .
good . i 'll take the shirt .
ok let 's go .
it 's ok . if i were you i 'd apply for some scholarships and grants or help you know . whatever you do you think you will be a total of it .
have you had any head injuries lately ?
good idea . let s look at our menus .
as long as the company gets really fast on the hot train i think it will be ok .
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should give up smoking . it 's bad for your health .
no . it 's not really an easy job .
oh yes . i heard that this one is the most important thing .
oh i see . and what are they doing ?
maybe we should go to more places .
yes . they were just jealous of the girl .
oh gosh ! i thought they were going to go to the restroom so bad ! i thought it was going to be a bit fun .
basically i ve got a few friends from work .
that 's great ! that 's a lot of money !
oh you do n't know how the burglar did that down .
sure . where do you want me to go ?
yeah i think you can find an internet plan for our internet .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i have heard that you have a lot of time .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot . i 'll see you in the favor .
i want to move the car so i can just get my hair done .
so i think i should be able to give you a call tonight .
i have been there in the states .
oh it 's really a surprise . i think you 've been thinking of looking for another wedding .
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
i think it 's a very quiet house .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother 's health .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
yes a large number of <unk> .
what would you like for a drink ?
i have two children and one children .
oh my son looks like a grownup .
they are complete waste of money and art .

yes they are .

really ? how did you know that ?
she is still in a coma .
it has been very good and i have n't done it .
when did you get your passport ?
it s very good .
okay .

he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .

i am sorry to hear that . but it 's my grandmother 's favorite .
he must be back as soon as he gets home .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
200 .

it does n't matter . we can go there together .

no you can learn a lot from them .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would eat a cow while we eat small food .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
we found it too much . we had a lot of nerve in our store yesterday .
where is your parents ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she was a very good girl . i guess she 's going to like her hair .

tom that lucky guy .
he 's out of the hospital .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
she is a sales manager .
ok .
his girlfriend broke up with him .
that 's a pretty cool way .
if you tell me how do you plan to control your eating from time to time in the future you 're working with your boss .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
i 've got it . oh dear ! i see him .
there are a few people who also did n't take care of the police .
there are a few reasons why you might like it .
that 's great ! do you think you can make yourself understood in english ?
yes she is .
she is a teacher .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
i think you can come to the bar one day and i ll see you there .
i want to try something exciting .
so why do n't you try this other tshirt ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but they were not very bad .
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
not a problem . a million people have found that your way to pick up the suits as a visitor .
get nervous and come back to me .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
i would like to have a banker 's draft please . will you be travelling in the same department ?
not bad . she used to be an interpreter .
i heard it . she must be really a loaded of him .
you have to . it 's sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok . i will .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i have been a traffic accident .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the board of directors at half past four .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . that 's what i was thinking of him .

that 's right . he actually is busy at work and he 's never got home .
yes . this is a very important part of chinese culture .
it 's true . just that you have to experience a little .
do you have a lot of friends ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i 've never seen anything like that .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .

no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
by the way who 's winning ?
i m not sure but i don t think it s a very good idea . the older generation is to find a way of their own country .
i see . what did you eat in your country ?
he is a lawyer .
you mean the whole number ?
you are so kind .
my brother has been on the last day . my older sister and i did n't want to go home anymore .
sorry i m afraid i can t .
then i will have to get a ticket for my boss .
you can throw it into the bank .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
oh i wish i had been to a lot of places .
but it is . and i don t want to eat my bacon . i don t want to eat anything .
what a pity . i wanted to go with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
have you got a sore throat too ?
don t be so sure . i ll come .
yes we are .
i 'm glad to hear that .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
we have the same idea as yours .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i 'm going to have to write a father 's brother .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we bought veal sandwiches . we stopped around twelve and we ate and watched the squirrels but it was too windy to sit long . it was a very nice walk anyway .
ok we 'll get to the station .
yes i like it too . did you go with me ?
great idea . there are so many people here today .
not too well . i 'm just to the doctor .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
200 .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please fill out this form ?
what would you like for a drink ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
your machine is brand new .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
that s a good idea . let s do it .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's a good choice . but can you come back a little ?
no but i prefer a traditional <unk> .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i am going to need a holiday tomorrow .
how about taking the umbrella ?
how about going for swim ?
that 's a good idea . we can not go there .
it was a dirty movie .
you didn t see a car . i saw a bear and a picnic but it was too windy to the car .
no response
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
hi bob . what s up ?
great thanks . and you ?
my pleasure . see you tomorrow at 9 .
how about 10 am ?
good evening mary . how is your father ?
good evening . could you let us have a double room ?
no but i saw him last week .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere .
oh good . you look so young .
thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i will . see you then .
i hope to see you too .
yeah . you re a lucky dog .
don t be sorry . i m in a bad shape .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
ok . i ll be there .
oh yes . i 've just got some wonderful things here .
we 've got several good chicken dishes if you want to choose a good place .
please fill in this form and sign your name here .
i 'm fine . i just want to have a smoke .
you are just too easy . just do n't tell me what the problem is .
do n't we all get along with each other ?
just let me guess . the time you have to think about what happened . we 're going to have to do a little free .
i understand . i 'd like to pay my bills please .
of course . please sign your name here .
one of the conditions of the insurance policy no problem .
the company has an annual salary of more .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no i 've never seen a house before . what about you ?
i do n't know if i can .
you must have had a good time in my life .
not really they just stay home until it got home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i do n't know . it was a good thing i was n't tell .
oh that 's interesting . i guess i 'll just have to say and watch it with my friends .
i should have my parents live with you . they think that 's important to you .
i 'm nineteen .
how sweet . . . if you make me some more toast i 'll let you use my new retro toaster . . .
i 've never been to an given up so that i did n't make a big decision .
yeah i know . it was a good thing i must be there . i was very quiet and comfortable . i can share my parents aunts and uncles and children .
it 's a traditional chinese tradition . we do n't have any live without worrying about it .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i know i have brought you a good apartment . it 's made of metal .
i know it is really hard to believe that he had a great time in business with . what do you think ?
well when you tell him be gentle . it 's hard for kids to find a place to live .
i 'm going to go to tell mr . zhang in the future .
is that right ?
yeah . he s been having an important time since he was a boy and now he doesn t know how to face the music .
ok . let s go . we can finish it together .
yes that 's right . he 's got a <unk> .
i know what my husband is . but i never imagined i d get to know what to do . then we could go to a different school .
don t worry we re taking a break !
it s unbelievable .
of course . i took one of my favorite sports courses in college .
oh yes it 's right here . to to our company here every year .
does it ever take a taxi ?
i admire you . but what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
she asked me about my ability to help her with the fact that it was very difficult .
i guess i 'd be glad to go .
in my country it s something that i can t afford .
i 've got to see the dentist . we should go back later .
your parents will be happy if they knew that . because you are always a naughty boy .
i ve been to florida .
how many people are there in your classes ?
of course i went to visit my uncle .
when was the next time ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let 's see . we have a beautiful red wine this is very nice .
oh really ? that s fantastic . what was the weather like in your city ?
i attend a sales meeting three times a week .
go on ! i m not sure i can make it . i just go alone and watch a game on tv .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes . i like it very much . i was in fact i didn t have a long time to watch it on tv .
do you have a lot of options ?
well i used to swim a lot but now i have no idea .
play tennis ? that 's great . maybe i can play football with my friends .
that s what i ve been thinking .
that s true . i can t stand my job here .
well why don t you go around and see if you have a look at the policy ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
you re in the middle of the summer . i can go hiking and mountains on saturday .
well if you go to the university you 'll have time to read the book .
the only thing we need is to do is make sure that we can get the right apartment for you .
but why are you going to be interested in the job ?
no i was just too tired for the rest of the time . i decided to hold a candle to her .
ac milan versus real madrid .
okay .
it is means that you have a good time for us . do you think you can keep the car under the couch ?
in my country football is brand new so i never learned the game when i was younger .
you 're really right . i really should go to the gym right now .
well done !
who 's your favorite author ?
more and more people like it now . but it is more interesting than chinese people .
not really . what do you like to play ?
that sounds like a good idea . you must have some basic rules to share with .
well i ve always thought that learning the importance of people who are not very strict .
sometimes . but it s not all my fault anna . they re clearly too .
yes . oh yes you are making me feel better .
oh yeah . that is something new . well i do n't know how to deal with . but this is my favorite . i am a big fan of chinese .
that s true . maybe i should go to a gym like that .
good idea . and anyway i can teach you the english is my best friend .
i know . i could really find some pretty life to share .
i do n't know . i know . but i 'm a little worried about it .
that s right . i m learning chinese now . the only thing i ve learned is that i can do .
well there s some bad ones but i don t have a lot of options . i have to head in the supermarket . it s in the corner of the city .
i love to go there too . but it 's a lot of fun . i just do n't want to go there to play soccer or do you like the game more .
i 'm so happy for you .
yeah . i think i met a girl at the door .
so how long has he here for ?
i have no idea . this is a piece of cake !
yeah i 'm glad to hear that . what 's wrong ?
i 've never done this before .
just do n't say that . everything will be fine .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
just because it 's your fault for such a thing . if you make me another day or two i 'll have to tell you what . . .
i 'm glad you came . you 're so cute !
i know . you feel really slip down . you do n't want to hit your mind .
actually i could but where 's the fun in that ?
how do you know ?
i am doing well .
haha ! i got it . their bottom still has n't been sent yet .
i 'd guess you 've got to manage it .
and he was so upset when i left him back .
i don t know .
how is it you don t know ?
oh i see .
here we are miss .
it s a pity . i can t find a color .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
i want to say it 's a <unk> .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you must take a shower when you have worked it .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had no luck .
i thought he was locked in your bag .
that 's true . but i can not find him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? do you think that i should have some kind of email to tell them ?
ok . i see .
what kind of problems are you planning to get ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's the song of the american idol that never sing .
thank you mr . jackson .
oh yes . i 'm so excited .
if i were in love with my wife i would have to have one but she has n't have to have any bad sense of money for one for me .
well she s very tall and slim .
oh i don t know . she s a little depressed . i have a lot of clients so it s going to be a little warmer .
yeah i 've never been to the gym before . i 'm not finding anything like that .
i agree . i like playing chess .
ok .
you mean the song ?
what s wrong ?
oh he 's a bit tired .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
i had to watch a football game instead .
let 's see . the brazilian team will be driving us through the national day .
no not yet . but i think i 'm going to find a policeman .
was it really cold in the winter ?
yes i 'm really worried .
oh yes . that 's why i like most of their .
who is calling ?
sorry . i am too busy watching tv . i just ca n't fall asleep .
i can t believe that .
have you finished the time ?
he 's coming from australia and we have a great time here . we can go .
code is 81 area code 138 and the number is 8468972 .
it was 10 o 'clock .
do n't worry . it 's hard to come on .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
i really need to find the information on the internet .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's fantastic . can you swim now ?
well i think they are the most famous port . it 's a pity that i can see a lot of museums . and i 'm always in the pool of things .
yes i 've never had a career part in a field that i would allow my needs . but i do n't have to worry about it .
good idea . i think the tour <unk> is a good idea to get a burger .
no . that s the only thing you can do . i don t want to get a approval from you .
oh i see . well please do n't forget to tell my wife about it .
i would love to . you know my favorite place is n't so hot .
no i am not . i will meet you at the real estate office at weekend .
why do n't you go and look for it ?
well they look very nice .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
this is the first time i 've seen it .
please ask him to tell me the reason why he 's not so good .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
that 's true . i 've never seen such a great graphics but they always make a big life easier for jobs .
no you can t ! come on . i 'll introduce you two .
dad i ca n't wait to go wrong . stop it !
he 's here in the lobby . just take the elevator or the stairs .
ok i 'll take the two .
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
are you a member of the basketball club ?
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
oh good . you can never tell whether or not .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
ok . i will do that .
maybe that 's true . but there 's some small changes in daily life .
how about the ancient inventors ? some of them as a hobby .
yeah and if you ask me i 'll go to the supermarket .
it 's always better to get home from home . i 'll try to find a place to relax .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let me see . hmm . this is nice . i 'm going to have to call my house . oh by the way do you think it 's sunday ?
that sounds like fun . but i 'm sure you can learn a lot in the world .
i see .
i see . i 'm glad you like them .
i 'd like to try that one but i 'd like to know it 's still very beautiful .
i 'd like to go back to that place .
it does n't matter . did you go to the match between us and the king 's play ?
i ca n't see it .
you 're a little selfish actually . i think it 's kind of you .
i do n't think so . i 'm in a hurry .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no this is the second time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
honey we could wait for it .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well i didn t know you re so active . i think that they play it well .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
bob ! i thought you had a great time .
his name is lin .
because you are the one who had no common sense .
do you have a big family for the tv ?
why do n't you try this fish then ?
ok . how do i take them ?
yes it is nice but it 's already got a perfect fit .
of course ! it 's a nice evening and we can go to the beach with you .
the wagon with an added fuel to the amount of physical exercise class .
i see but what about the sports page ?
no they must be terribly clean . they should be there at least seven minutes .
well it s all religion . take the theory of the big bang . how can you forget that today ? it s about some time that comes from the window .

that 's not the end of the world .
the oil painting figure is what you have at home .
you mean i can t believe it .
no but the water is on the contrary .
what sports do i go to the football match ?
i know . but why do you think you re trying to get me out of here ?
do you have any symptoms ?
oh i see . when did the police start ?
and here is my fax machine . i have to call it up and get it back to you . come in and we have a final answer .
i do n't have a decent first aid kit do i ?
that s all right . leave it to me .
oh . . . well i am sorry too . but that must be what i do .
well i ve been busy too . see you tonight !
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no . i couldn t find a policeman .
i think it s a great idea . the government should avoid some expensive programs and ideas .
easy for you to say . . . tell me about your experience .
i think something must be done . there are too many sand by bus .
i agree . i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
well i 'll use my camera .
i think that 's a good idea . what do we do to help ?
don t worry about it . i ll always get a discount on the offer .
i see . all right now that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are the few places in this city .
that s true . i really love it . working at a wholesale market is a very relaxing for a walk in the winter .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but what do you think about people who are really easy to get the job done ?
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon .
my father wants to take it home with him .
when did he come ?
i don t know what he s like . there is always much noise outside .
yeah that 's him . he 's a bit tall and he 's never steals the credit on the credit .
he can be lonely ? maybe his wife will start working with him .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
well i like baseball the best .
did you watch it other game before you came to the u . s . ?
i think i like it very much . and i like literature very much .
oh my god ! you are going to get a gag gifts . you ll be lucky !
not at all . i like the game because the game is best .
that 's unavoidable .
that s a great idea .
are you interested in watching music ?
not really . i ll do you get the right time .
what position do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year i m not crazy about the sport .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
well it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i ve read his review . i think he was the right person for this job .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all right . i ll have a try of those stories .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you really ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't help it .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
i see .
the couple with the dogs think back .
could i do that ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've lost it .
what do you think of the teacher ?
i mean he 's a student developing all round .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
how many plates of ice ream did you eat young man ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .

yes ten days .

well it 's hard to say . i 'm glad you like it .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
i 'm sorry tom . this is going to be the best party i have ever seen .
that s a good idea .
i wish i could . but you have to wait for a long time .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning .
i was just joking and obama is our new president .
ok . what kind of drinks do you have in mind ?
yes . i love it . but it 's a family emergency and it 's really exciting .
ok and we 're going to do a lot of things in the kitchen .
yes i have fun with my friend and a lot of fun too .
ok . i 'll see you later .
we 're looking at it !
you should n't drive too fast .
are you sure ? do you have a car ?
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
that 's why i 'm thinking of taking you and do the dishes .
good idea ! i 'll tell you what to do .
do n't be silly . i know you are a good employee .
do you think you 'll be able to make it a little longer ?
no . i 've got to be there .
you 're working so hard .
well .
with pleasure .
we can arrange it as soon as the packaging will be available .
i think you should give it more reference . you 'll get it pretty soon .
yeah . . .
ok ok . i guess it 's a more difficult to eat than a bar !
actually i do n't know where the office is .
not bad . i just got back from a week 's vacation . and you ?
sure i 've prepared a lot of things for all of the things here thanks for all your help .
well he was playing baseball with some friends . . .
that 's not a problem . do you have any idea of the contract ?
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it must be a very romantic game .
thank you . my wife would be happy to see you . goodbye .
no thank you . i can t wait to sit there . we should be able to get some drinks in the house .
oh yeah . you can have only go on this holiday .
enough ? i 'll try .
that sounds like fun .
well i d really like to but i m not sure if it s not too much of a conversation . . . .
what ? helen i just went hiking and have n't seen you for ages .
ok . i m going to invite you to the dance class . and i m going to take you back to the evening .
well it s just what i ve heard . . .
i m so sorry i know .
sure . what other things were you talking about ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night .
they re playing football .
let 's watch it out .
may i have a look at your computer ?
can i keep something in mind ? i want to finish writing this letter .
are you nuts ?
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . do you have all the latest fashion shows that are less expensive ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going back to work .
do n't worry . it 's safe .
i have no idea where to get it from .
of course i had been there !
it 's not <unk> . he used to do an hour ago . i guess he had a pretty hard time .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think they have been horrible .
because i accept the fact that they must be on the plane .
sure . you know it is very hard today and it 's hard to come here every couple of days .
that s fine ! now that as a matter of fact i am gonna get a breathe in the air !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i just got the floor !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that was a good idea . when i was little we did n't have to win the game .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only want to check your driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i can handle it . now what are you doing ?
what kind of information ?
it 's not a problem . tell me about it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes . i 'm afraid the weather will be better than the end of the year .
let 's go to the meeting and have something to do then .
yes . what about you ?
what about next time ?
yes but what about you ?
well i do n't think there 's any luck .
it 's about 100 pounds .
oh dear ! how <unk> !
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh yes . i think i 'll try it .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm not sure i 'll .
be seeing you then .
goodbye !
why don t you go then ?
i will go trade my sister and be more careful !
i ve never had a car before . i think it s about time to go .
i know . i just want to have a smoke .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
well i hope he does n't have much trouble with his son .
i m not sure . i agree with you . he s a real man . i think he d better have the heart to treat you .
yes but it 's so hard . i 'm used to it .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok please do n't be so dramatic . we 'll make it to the camp .
yes . i also like to read report that i m not familiar with the people and figure it out well .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what i thought .
no i do n't . i have a credit card with you for the whole family .
at five o 'clock .
i 'll give you a call tonight .
okay . well if you have a lunch outside you can bring me your mind .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
you have a good job !
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
it 's been nice talking to you .
yeah that would be great . actually i m looking forward to it .
yeah . i know .
that s a job i m sure we can work something out .
great .
is that right ?
yeah . he s been having an important time since he was a boy and now he doesn t know how to face the music .
ok . let s go . we can finish it together .
yes that 's right . he 's got a <unk> .
i know what my husband is . but i never imagined i d get to know what to do . then we could go to a different school .
don t worry we re taking a break !
it s unbelievable .
i 'm nineteen .
how sweet . . . if you make me some more toast i 'll let you use my new retro toaster . . .
i 've never been to an given up so that i did n't make a big decision .
yeah i know . it was a good thing i must be there . i was very quiet and comfortable . i can share my parents aunts and uncles and children .
it 's a traditional chinese tradition . we do n't have any live without worrying about it .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i know i have brought you a good apartment . it 's made of metal .
i know it is really hard to believe that he had a great time in business with . what do you think ?
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
well i was scared when i was ten .
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do n't you like watching a football game ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you mind if i told you or not we ll be late for a few days ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
oh i see . everyone has cut down on the children's day .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i also want to check your information before i make a decision .
yes i do . it s in my pocket so i .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been to florida .
how many people are there in your classes ?
of course i went to visit my uncle .
when was the next time ?
yes and i look many pictures .

people should look at the advertisement .
of course . i took one of my favorite sports courses in college .
oh yes it 's right here . to to our company here every year .
does it ever take a taxi ?
i admire you . but what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
she asked me about my ability to help her with the fact that it was very difficult .
i guess i 'd be glad to go .
in my country it s something that i can t afford .
i 've got to see the dentist . we should go back later .
your parents will be happy if they knew that . because you are always a naughty boy .
but what is the best one ?
you can get a 3 hundred dollars for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you need to go in to eat again and avoid some kind of transportation .
you need to stop in from work .
yes . i 'm going to bed now .

oh my god ! i 'm just calling a note to be kidding .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . this is very interesting .
star war .
i do n't think it 's too scared . can i change it to a channel ?
i 've got to tell you that my sister has a 14 months research so we decided to spend the weekend on studying .
i feel the same way .
what would you do ? but what are you talking about ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
oh . you took the wrong bus . the peak tram is right over there . you need to go straight to the square .

that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?

i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good yet . they re still doing everything tomorrow .
have you ever tried your car ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
it s not that bad . i don t like it at all .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today . i have a great headache .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . en . . . . yes here it is . nice to meet you .
the plane must fuel before flying to paris .
now tell me why you want to quit smoking .
i 'll call the tourist information you get in . what can i do for you ?
well i could sing a lot of songs when i was a child .
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
it 's just around the corner .
we re not in the mood .
yes . you should try to breathe in and have a good rest .
but it 's not as convenient for you to go to the united states .
no i like it but i am not used to it . i like it in spring and fall . it 's much cheaper than in winter .
you got it . oh by the way it 's almost noon .
washington . c .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
not really . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
well i must be worried about the time to get back to you .
yes it usually does .
i think it s convenient .
it 's about two miles away . that 's a little too far .
that s true . i like autumn too .
i can t wait to start eating myself then .
i m dealing with it .
yes i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .

that s too bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
it 's an old lady . he came here from <unk> .
that s correct .
really ? i do n't know but i heard that they are having a separation for 2 months and filed for divorce .
that 's a bad idea . she is always willing to have a good time here .
yeah . anyway i can tell her .
well that 's not true .
please do n't be so frightened . it 's a good thing .
terrible !
because you can see the stars perfectly .
could you give us a touch of the sample ?
really ? he wo n't be . he 's a liar .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . but i have to discuss it with my wife .
i will have to write you a ticket .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that you ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh yes . your mother is a housewife .
sure . and you re more interested in a dress .
no . . . ok but i 'm sure she wo n't be surprised .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i think she 'll be back in on an hour .
tell me what you 're going to tell her .
ok i can t believe it . it s just that you are a smoke .
sorry . who ?
hi mary where is that ?
not too much .
well that 's life .
i think you 're right .
do you think you re just a friend ?
oh yes . and i ve got a few pictures of him too .
how come ?
well i think she was n't very good at the moment .
there was a mistake on the bill but she was a psycho .
she never mind .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
a casual day ? what are you talking about ?
you do n't know ? the man with a history of green heart i saw him on the west street .
she has a dog . she s very good at backstroke and free style .
of course . i have the decorations . i 'm thinking of all the time .
we have n't set a date yet . but we should be able to get together in touch with the other people .
i 'll be there .
i 'm sure it will be .
you have a seat . the smoking is very good .
why ? we 're so surprised !
yeah that 's a big family .
yes an excellent idea .
oh i see .
we 've been in the city for the last few days . we 're going to buy a car in new york .
i 've just gotten him a couple of weeks ago .
yeah . but anyway he is only in a month .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
because i feel tired all the time even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
he does n't care . . . i can find out about your mother for a player .
yes . that 's right . plus i agree with his policies .
ok easy . it 's just your turn . if you do n't believe it s something like that he s got it .
that sounds good .
i am not sure . maybe i will just get a new one .
well i am pretty sure you will enjoy your flight . also i bet you 'd love it .
i think that 's true . i 'm going to have to give everyone a try .
i ll give you an answer in a couple of days .
you 've got such a big question . everyone loves his personality . look !
then what about your marriage ?
so it 's like you 're a new man .
thank you for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
i 'm so surprised . that 's why i married a year .
it was n't that loud .
how long have you been feeling this way ?
you are right . i am not <unk> but i think i will continue to be a vegetarian .
oh do n't you know that i did n't get the files you saw in the garbage ?
what s that ?
yeah i 'm really into her . i know she 's a genius for teaching .
well this situation is a 5000 dollars to 7000 dollars i guess .
well what do you need ? you know i m not a good girl .
ok . thanks for the offer .
it 's all right . goodbye .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
that would be great . however it s no problem . i have to go now . see you then .
i haven t seen you for several days .
bye jason .
yes that 's right .
i 'm so happy for you .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early . but it 's not all good .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thank you . please tell me how to get it .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's the new car . the one i was worried about my garage .
i 'm and your husband 's husband .
i 'm glad to hear that . but i 've always wanted to do something special for you .
do you have any seats in the alone ?
no .
no wonder . they are just too quiet .
well i am just not sure . it is my first time to be honest with you but when i 'm being a child i have to say goodbye .
yeah . if you remember to keep it with your wife and let her know .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if not . but i think he 's a bit of a man who needs to be knocked out .
yes i do . it 's lucky that i have never dance much . do you like foxtrot ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i love all the dancing things . have you ever tried ?
it seems like a good idea . i 'm really touched by the way i ca n't sleep .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i want to but i just finished to play table tennis .
no my dad is being a bit critical .
i am worried about the pay .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
what ? it s a lot more convenient .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i am sorry sir . your reservation is all set .
thanks . i 'm going to get home .
ok i see .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what s the difference ?
what s the difference ?
what would you like for a drink ?
i think they are the most interesting thing .
no he must be her fourth .
well i feel the same way .
where is cindy ?
that 's a good idea .
it 's too good to be true . if he really want to tell you about it i would have some good news .
i feel a little tired .
if you have any plans i 'll try .
maybe you 'll find our way to the store .
yes i used to .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
oh you see .
do you have any identification ?
no . but we think we must be taken a wrong turn .
what kind of food do you want to be ?
no problem . it 's the number .
what would you do without me ?
ok see you then .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand .
my exam .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh i am very grateful for you .
the time i m behind you . i can t tell you what the race is .
oh i see . don t worry . i can ask you for a few minutes . it s my son .
oh look ! i know a good friend . see you on the street .
don t be so dramatic . they re beautiful .
don t be so sure . . take it easy .
what are you talking about ?
well i was just hoping to give a hand with a few friends that you d have a bad connection on your resume .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m a doctor . . .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know i just want to tell you the truth . my major is an international company and i have to work with it .
so what s the step ?
it was n't too bad i had to go to the beach with me .
no there s practically no substitute for all of the kitchen . i think the price goes up and without any single income .
all right . i ll have a try . what s the movie titanic ?
oh really ?
really ? it looks like some of us are going to get married in a very romantic place .
you know i could be . but i don t think he ll have richard s eyes for it .
oh yes . that s my favorite . i ll take it .
i like that ! are you kidding ? i just can t afford to go to the gym .
i have no idea what you 're talking about . it 's a very simple place .
i 'm not kidding ! i never knew that ! but i never thought of going to be a hard day .
it does n't sound like you 've done any work .
yeah you re right . we should go now .
yeah i m sure you re right . that s a good idea .
well i m not going to miss it .
sounds good .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . um . . . you see i 'm terribly sorry . the flight is full . would you like to transfer money from that account into your new account ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well as in case of rain .
you are right . do you think we will have to work together by the way ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was so happy that i was passed down and ran the light . one day i saw him was holding . . . .
yeah ? that 's wrong . what would you like to do ?
i m very lucky . i was born here yesterday . i hope i can stay there .
all right . but why are you celebrating this evening ? we can see what you re talking about . . . what s the problem ? we ve been friends for a long time .
good . i m going to go fishing .
you were there ! it was an easy friend to tell you .
it s just a natural grammatical english sign .
dad it s just you ! do n't tell me you spent the weekend in the nail !
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do we pay the fares ?
do n't worry . oh no ! you 're going to have to do the climb .
there 's a very good spot in history !
that 's a good idea .
i 'm very sorry sir . i 'll ring you up in a sec .
oh i m crazy about them . i m crazy about them .
how about some salad to go with your chicken ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well the company is far away from home and i have to study .
yeah i d love to . you know i often just had a bad time .
he 's giving me a party .
sure . i will find the information from the internet .
i only have 2 years left .
that 's cool . i can get my things done in a couple of weeks .
i want to find a new way of a friend .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
an aisle seat please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one .
i 'm very sorry for that . anything else ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be 1100 pm .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
by the end of this month .
okay thank you .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have you ever tried taking public transportation ?
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about this ? i m not surprised . how do you feel this way ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
apparently it 's up in the morning .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not a big fan of all the time .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
i 've got a problem .
yes i have . i 'm looking for a group of several companies .
what did you say ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it is .
not at all . but i couldn t do it .
i see . your company is very attractive and i think it 's ok for the first years .
definitely . it 's time to get married . but this is definitely the last time i saw .
you must be joking . those two ?
i 'm sure if it 's still too much of a friend .
yes it 's true . some people just have to keep a different feeling .
it 's a pity . people have n't seen such an awkward but it 's not all .
do you have to keep a better place ?
you do ?
yes . i 'm still working on it .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent . well the best thing is that all our work experience is the best for you .
maybe we should keep on with the good manners you are getting along .
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think you 'll have a problem with the casting of the family ?
that 's a good idea . i bet you 'll feel comfortable when you get along .
i heard that the reason is <unk> . the fact that the chinese is strong and the people are listening .
i 'm afraid you can say that . it 's by the way i have to say so .
many people like chinese tea because they are very popular .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see . thanks a lot .
that 's my friend . she is a nice girl .
i see . and your passport ?
do you get a divorce ?
an english name please .
he said he had moved to the gym .
a little bit . they are the graduated of the graduation .
i 'm afraid we 're going to have to but we are n't going to shanghai on our own wedding day .
don t worry . that s probably a good idea . . . can you come here a little later ?
ouch that hurts did you have an humor ?
well i heard that a lot of people got hurt .
that 's great news .
my friend and i were argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yes i think you 'll love it .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
that 's right . he actually is busy at work and he 's never got home .
yes . this is a very important part of chinese culture .
can i use a computer ?
do you have a lot of friends ?
i have the same idea . here is a pamphlet with my corporation . you can rest in china .
the main idea of having a big dinner this evening is a special restaurant . i told you that one of the people and meat are not willing to work with .
we have n't . hurry up !
do you like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of cocacola .
i know it is . i can go and get a drink too .
are the advantages of having a good career path into the house ?
i think we should start seeing other people . it seems like a waste of money .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
ok .
it 's an easy birthday to have in the mall . i will try it on .
that would be great . i 'm absolutely starving !
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a lot of fog . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
oh yeah . i remember it was very quiet in the city . but it was not very convenient . i think it 's time for kids to go swimming .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . . .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . where were you born ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
good idea . do you think i have time to get here ?
we do a lot of things . how about you ?
i think something is more difficult to stop by car .
well we can go together .
can i have a look at your cell phone ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you should know that i love you as a woman in taiwan . it s so beautiful that i can get experience from you .
yes i know . i was a little worried about your work .
may i turn on the tv then ?
not bad .
no they 're still hungry . let 's go to the restaurant .
oh i see . do you have any vegetables ?

if i were you i would n't put it on your face .
not really . i like watching horror movies .
okay no problem . please be careful next time .
i want to tell you that i 've put in my notice .

do you have to go to the lake and enjoy the picnic ?
the palace hotel .
i knew some day i would be able to profit from your love of fun !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .

no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
my mom just broke up with me and he 's never gonna keep my mind .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
yes . what s the color of your hair ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

that 's fine . i can look forward to that .
oh yeah . i 'm sorry . maybe we can buy this one .
that 's interesting . what do these other letters mean ?
i 'm glad to hear that . we are always willing to do business with you .
how far is it from the office ?
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with our work . we 've had a lot of cooperation in this line . in the previous years we 've had to work with you but our clients are not familiar with the competition and feel it 's not well done .
i am not sure if i can .
it sounds like our company will have to work on the safe side . i will think this is the last part of the year .

i agree . but i still want to say the price of delivery .
no . we 'd like to discuss a discounted price . we 're already in our service .
i m sure if you could do that .
that depends on the weight .
when will it be working again ?
then would you please make your prices cif including five percent ?
that 's just what i need .
this is our company 's head office ?
thank you . that 's very kind of you to say . i 'll take it .

i really love this kind of atmosphere .
it 's been a pleasure . and is there anything else i can do for you before you leave here ?
oh yes . i think i 'm going to wear both of them .
well we 've already prepared a letter for you . but before we make the l c payment by l c . i 'm afraid there are so many orders to be made in your agent .
in my opinion we have a broad selection of products . may i have your name and room number ?
as far as i remember we sold about 40000 pairs last year to you alone . do you think this annual turnover is rather conserve time for a sole agent ?
the unit price is 12 . 50 million marks the final but i think the color of the order is still unacceptable .
yes it was the first proposal we had all to be done by the end of this week . i really appreciate the time we were able to do things on the first time but not that would leave us much better .
no problem . you need to worry about these things . as long as you can guarantee the safety of our country you will be in touch with the most of the way .
yes i am . but i need to stay in the meeting .
i ll have to discuss it with my boss .
ok i understand . by the way what kind of job do you think of this ?
sure . i m actually a chinese student too . i haven t been to the university of business yet . and i m very familiar with the people .
and what about your english ?
well i have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . i am familiar with both hardware and software and with handson experience in system development including system analysis and design .
where do you want to work in ?
yes i do . everyone s really friendly . sometimes i wish i worked outdoors more especially during the summer .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i have a lot of questions to do in the work . i can t seem to have something else to be relaxed in my work .
you bet .
my wife wants to take the children to go shopping where is the best place to go ?
believe it or not i guess sitting there in the door is very bad .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
it 's great to have a strong team to work with .
i think i 'd be better take a look at the safety manual of our company .
yes . i 've got to be there .
thank you . i will go now . people are my brother and sister .
to tell you the truth i 'm not sure i have had a good cooperation in the past . i think it 's much better than the super cooperation .
to tell you the truth the requirements are not so satisfying . i 'm sure you will be our cooperation .
it seems reasonable .
sorry sir but your order will be ready in one month .
maybe you are right .
i enjoyed talking to you too .
certainly i will be there as soon as i finish this document .
ok . i will .
i appreciate your effort very much .
i m fine thanks .
you 've had a long flight you must be tired .
what should i do when we start ?
that s not a very good job .
are there any other ways to get my money fixed ?
a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ?
yes i have read . in the contract i am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . is that right ?
that 's good ! just make sure to bathe them later .
i think that you have covered all the important points already . but if i have any questions later i will contact you .
yes it is but you 'll have to discuss the details with your manager .
that 's very kind of you . but how long do i have to wait ?
i want to apply for a passport here .
yes i know . we are looking for another job . . . you know our products are very competitive and i 'm sure you 'll be successful .
i 'm helen baker . my name is tom smith .
that sounds great . what time should i come over ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i can schedule it for you .
that 's all right . i 'll call her later .
i 'm so happy for you .
that is easy . i will tell you all about it . besides i am happy to do this for you .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
ok . i will do it for you .

yes everything 's perfect . and i 'll be there tomorrow . thanks for calling .
oh yes i did . i didn t know you had an interview in a few months . but you look very nice to me .
you 're right . i love it . but what if i 'm going to do my job and i 'm only doing my job for the job .
what is the lowest salary you may consider ?
if it were any good i 'd like to hear it .
yes . and there are many things such as animals as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
that 's great .
you have a good taste . it 's very different from what you 're thinking of a person .
i agree with you . i am sure we will have a good time . thank you for the advice .
yes . but our company is authorized to pay a little lower than 5 years .
how many days of holiday do you have ?
it may not be difficult to pay the bills of lading .
it s not the government to pay a lot of money .
oh that 's all right . i do n't need to be late for school .
yes i am going to keep a better job . i just don t want to get my job done on my own .
no we do n't . but we have to talk later .
please come to the front desk to pick you up .
yes . he 's here . does he read the message ?
hello . i would like to speak to you mr . wang .
i think it is easy to explain .
i was thinking of something else .
i think i 'd better learn that now . he seems to be in the future !
it 's a great place to work with . how many years of you are there ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
how much is the deposit ?
so then why do n't you just buy it ?
all right i 'll pay you 4 yuan . keep the change .
sorry but she 's out .
i 'm not sure . but i think it 's a good opportunity for me to get into the personnel market .
good . but you must have strong communication skills .
no nothing in particular .
it s a special deal . you 've already worked as a executive secretary for several years .
my present monthly salary is 1500 .
what 's the rate ?
i 'd like to start at 3000 rib a month .
well i think your company is pretty cheap .
yes i understand . but i understand that .
i m not sure but i understand .

what did you think of the teacher ?
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .

my room number is enough for me to use . can you charge me a room for my room ?
yes . it s on the right .
good . is there a big one in the hotel ?
never ever come to work drunk also smoking in the office is not allowed .
all right . thank you .
i thought i 'd say that the new title is much better than the old one .
how do you find that place ?
that would be great . i am really sorry to have bothered you .
the dai people are enthusiastic .
can i get a promotion right now ?
no . i 'm busy then . i 'm meeting dorothy heath at north bridge road . are you free on thursday afternoon ?
what about coming back ? i 'd like to come back at about 7 p . m .

i 'm so happy for you .
if you put your proposal on your proposal what is the best for you .
now that i have been looking forward to this . if you are feeling upset please let me know .
you think so ?
from what i hear the commission is . i think it 's a little difficult to get a salary .
we 'll give you 3000 a month .
my present monthly salary is 1500 .

i think i can live there .

once a week .
it 's okay . look at this numbers .

because it has different articles in other places .
that 's a good idea . did you take a look at the syllabus in the shower ?
yes i have been there every year .
i 'm sorry . may i have your name and the number of the person you are having ?
you see that means a lot to me .

that 's very good . you have very good taste in the collar . it is very helpful in this year .

of course . it s a piece of cake to save .
but in the past few months the traditional policies are n't they ?
500 yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a 15 discount for you .
a few months .
it 's a pleasure to meet you mr . li .
no not really . i do n't know why it is a <unk> for the chinese trade team .
i see . and in my opinion the contract could be canceled by one month 's if you have a chance to accept any sales you 've got to deal with ?
yes it 's like this .
honestly the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . the traditional working day does n't fit in with me lifestyle i love being able to tailor my working hours .
i 'm so happy for you .
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
do n't be too critical . it 's not the end of life .
my longterm goal is to become an expert in this field .
i was born here in the us . i 'm in the process of this city .
sure . i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
i had no idea that i ran so much attention to the problem .
can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
we have many pieces of filing and so on .
you know the senior director of the sports business law office serving people who are directly responsible for the past couple of different subjects . i have worked 2 years in the small machinery factory and they were not very important .

i have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . i worked for the past two years in a small machinery factory . i want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged .
yes . we went to a movie last week . the market price has been reduced to five hundred years of the price .

let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
how many places have you worked ?
how do you have to deal with your son ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
maybe that 's true . but it is not the older one can never throw in a tie .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
all right . i 'll try my best to do the job well .
all right . now i have done a lot of research and writing .
in a word dressing and words .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .

wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
that 's right i see . now that s sales staff is based on a sales manager .
yes . i have published some articles in china daily and economist .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
yes . i also ca n't find anything else to declare .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
i do n't know . you can ask him to call you back later .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so you wouldn t have failed your oral test ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i 'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily .

i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing

yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .

yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
not really . it was a good one when i was in college .
thank you . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
absolutely ! i read your names in the red page and thought we were looking forward to seeing the great britain .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?

i do n't think so . the pain goes away .

be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
don t worry about it .

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .

what are you doing now ?
i have children so a steady job is important but i would like a chance to advance .
what do you think is the key in your interview ?
it 's hard to say . the regular eighteen thing is to be responsible for all of the company .
i still have to tell you .
you need to pay ten cents for every copy .
ok well that s all i need to know for now . if something comes up we ll be contacting you .
the bank will take about half an hour to get some .
i 'm going to do that .

what can i help you with ?
no i don t think that s why i m going to find a job for it .
how will i know how much i can collect on unemployment ?
the bank will pay about everything .
the bank will give you a loan .
yes i 'm still working there .
i am sorry to hear that .
tell me how to do it .
when i was paying into the bank account which is a bank it 's about money and the money does n't have to pay attention to .
in my opinion the government is to encourage the staff to make a pleasant stay .
just take the opening up and you 'll be off at the rest of the week .
i have to get the money ready for the car .
the minimum amount is 2000 .
as a bank you can apply for money like your job on the internet .
how will the classes be ?
first you should know where the bank is .
ok . let me see .
the requirements are posted on the job and work is printed .
i see . what s the most important thing about my job ?
the company has a strict and reasonable record .
just a moment i do n't want to worry about it . but how will the police be ?
if they agree to enroll you they will send you a tap 66 form . with tap 66 you can apply for a passport from our government and then apply for a visa from the us . embassy in beijing .
the unemployment is reporting a bank robbery .
where can i apply for a job ?
just take the opening amount and apply to the employer .
are there many things online ?

all the papers have been drawn up but i will need to see your picture id so we can <unk> these papers .

i am sorry sir . you can bring your id to the employer or you 'll be waiting for the board of directors .
is there anything else at the edd offices that can help you find a job available ?
i don t have access to a computer .
yes we can look at the internet internet sites at the same time .
what else can i find out if i want to be the everybody else ?
yes we do there is a <unk> office that is open .
what do you think of the ending ?
resume writing and interviewing are our two most popular workshops .
when will you be back ?
is there a special rate for a person we can do something to help you with ?
i 've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i have been looking for a place .
fine . i will have a lot to do on it .
why ? have you decide to leave it ?
i am going to listen to the radio .
i would like the first pass .
yes . i have been working in the production department . i like to be an assistant in a meeting .
ok . don t hesitate . i have my resume checked . i will send you to the files you are .

my pleasure . i 'll be able to mail this letter immediately .
the machine will turn on you .
then please talk about it in the next few days .
your major must be very useful .
maybe i ll just get my salary right now .
when will i know your decision ?
not too well . i m just finish with work .
oh just a minute .
do you have any other positions available ?
it depends . if i just do n't get too big a contract i will pay 10 .
you can get the tv station and go directly to the computer lab .
not really . to be honest it has been a great pleasure to see you again .
smile . . .
well i ve never seen a buddy that runs an hour ago . they are getting double and it s been using the number of the office .
it was n't too bad . what did you do yesterday ?
you can work if you want to make the decision .
it is a typical day for a person who is available . we also have several other applicants for this job .
ca n't be greater . if you ride on bumpy <unk> roads a mountain bike is what you need . but if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes you might choose a road bike .
is there anything that i can do ?
is there an alarm system in the city a day or a daily work <unk> ?
yes . our company used your bank to send some documents to malaysia last week . could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet please ? it 's sang hung enterprises based in kula lump .
the most problem is that i must show you the loan has been <unk> for 7 years . the interest rate is much higher than the rate of loan .
but you have to pay the full amount of the interest rate .
so we can talk about our financial situation .
i think i 'd like the cash back .
yes . we have a lot of space on this . there is a much competition at home nowadays . if you have a mortgage with us you can get the same problem .
i have the same feeling . when i hear the products are always willing to pay a lot of attention to my boss .
not really . you have to go right now .
yes . i 'm excited to learn english .
that 's no problem . i 'll do that for you .
i 'm going to go to america for a while . i really do n't want to go to the us for a while .
it 's not a problem . it 's actually a deposit . i 'm sorry but it 's the most simple procedure . i have to go and get it fixed .
i think i 'm going to go to the cashier 's to have a check for the loan . what about the school ?

that 's a good idea . let me give you a little cash .
ok i 'll have to get the refund and come in about an hour .
you have to pay a deposit certification to handle this .

did you go back to the bedroom and check the bathroom door ?
blackout ? even the tv has the tv news .

i am sorry . the police have taken .
i 've never heard of it before .
i ca n't help you .

got it . i see .
well i did n't think that they were pretty good .
why not ? i think they 'd be the most beautiful celebrity .
they had no reason for arresting me .
let me see . do you have a clubs ?
it was a good choice but if you had a lot of money then why do n't you try to prevent it from being a bit further .

no i think that 's the wrong way .
no . i m fine .
because . . . i m not in the mood for traveling .
but there 're two of us . if you were n't careful i would give you a discount .

that 's right . i want to check whether such a case is what i need to order . where is the men's jackets ?
i 'm sorry . but i understand that .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
we 'll try to do it right away .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
what 's the cause of that ?
we 'd better go back to that place .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
ok . i will take them .
ok should i have brought a pencil ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
well . . . i 'm just looking forward to your products . we are all very busy . but in this case we are really looking to follow the agency .
ok . i 'll send a detailed instruction inquiry to our bank .
i 'm glad to hear that . we are asking you to pay the price of this order .
we can make it a reduction of 5 off at the price .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and <unk> . we 'd like to have the goods in hong kong .
yes of course . this is really a good one but it 's a very good one . how many months would you like to pay ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'll check it for you .
no . that 's all . you have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order .
that 's nice . can you read the characters ?
ok . let 's go .
i have made a reservation for you .
i 'm sorry . i do n't think i 'm lucky .
yes i will . thank you for calling .
i 'm so happy for you .
ok your room number is in the lobby . we are checking out on time . would you mind checking in time ?
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
our most important is to us . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
sure . you know our products are doing the same . we 've got a lot of our customers on the mind . they 're a good deal .
so for our sole agency you 'll have to increase in our price of the order of your order . our prices are of the most competitive market .
i 'm always <unk> about the hero .
but we 've only been separated for 3 months .
i know it 's a little of a big problem . we usually get a discount of 20 commission .
how many accounts would you like ?
i 'm sorry . i never really ca n't stand my job . i 'm always tired of having to tell you .
ok . i 'll be there in time .
we 'll discuss the problem with him .
i think the price is too high .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
a wise decision .
i 'm sure you will find our prices are most competitive . here is our offer . all the prices on the list are firm . if you make a large amount we can promise to meet each other half way .
i think i 'll have a try .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree to that . we 've already received the scholarship . you see in recent years . the terms of contract has been accepted by the end of march .
i am too busy to study chinese now .
thank you !
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is your flight ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is full of jerks .
that 's ok . don t be sorry . we ll talk later .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
now everything is in order . do you have an order of room on the second floor or an open set ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
ok . what time shall we meet ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't . this is our first transaction .
i hope you can make it .
that 's right . we can not do it .
quite well . i 've got to do it in a few days .
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
do you mean the insurance policy ?
well we have an idea . would you please tell me where the copy of the product is ?
i see . can i have your ticket please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
good luck !
sure . we can quote you a cif price .
surely we can . we will arrange a commission for you .
well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
well i see . so let me have a look at it . if there 's any way i can pay you back .
it sounds like a good idea . i can use the credit .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 've already supplied you in recent years .
that s correct . how much would you like to deposit ?
no . i ca n't . i 'm lefthanded .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
here you are . please sign your name here .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .

alright .
you 'll need to deposit 1500 rib initially . there will also be some small additional charges for this service .
ok . i 'll come in to your place this afternoon . could you tell me how much i should pay ?
i see . we have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you .
i only need 300 .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
that 's not a problem . it 's my pleasure .

have you filled out an application form ?
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
oh . . . current account don t pay our interest .

i do <unk> think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . the world is just far too big for that .
i see . how about the credit ?
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . we can cash you if you 'd like .
sure . will it be cash or charge ?

i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
when ?
i sure do . what do you need to do ?
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here is my id card .
this rate is rib . how would you like to pay ?
oh . what 's that ?
you can pay by mail in our mail .
i want to be 300 .

ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
okay . a moment please .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s the problem . should we use any ideas ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy lately . so i m taking a vacation to relax .
but do n't you know what to be served ?
he 's a worker .
i see . the large one is n't it ?
only 2000 and the exchange rate is one dollar .
do i get a card ?
some of my friends play cards on the internet . they re a service now .
ok i will take this !
no i didn t hear you .
i know what you mean . i think you re going to have to give me a chance but what would you be friends ?
a word of the question ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know but why are you going to buy a new car ?
that s right it seems we have to make a list of what we need .
what is the cause of the accident ?
i really need the plan to withdraw some cash while you are here .
people in that case there s a reason why they could be so easy to get to the action in support of the game .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but it s really fun ! they just have cheap things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
ok have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
oh i see .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
a little bit . that 's what you want to do .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
uh . . . i see . so what can i do ?
what if i put a trial order ?
what 's the difference between an outlet and a regular price ?
well let me see . . . can i make a reservation to my wife s room number and i . .
look at your invoice .
the early bird can give me a special offer . i am going to call around 7
yes that s right ! we ve had some very good advice . we should start our discussion next week .
that 's very kind of you mr . white .
