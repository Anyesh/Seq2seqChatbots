it 's difficult to explain . the subway is very cheap .
do you accept credit cards ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .

it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .

ok . i see . thank you !

well do you think you 'd be a good fit or anything else ?
it is very kind of you . i 'm so moved by you .

no i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
congratulations on your promotion .
i found it three thousand dollars and a record .
let 's see . from here you have to take the 278bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
you 're new at this huh ?
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
how much is the fare ?
it does n't cost anything .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
leave me alone !
i 'd like to know about a new account .

some of my grappa will cure your shyness .
ok .

i 'll call you later .
please do n't make it too short . we 'd better make it for now .
it does n't matter . i think we are going to get together with our credit card .
i can try my best .
i think most of the students do that . they can have some difficulty in doing it .
size one . by the way what if i bring home this sweater and my wife doesn t like it ?
a taxi it is . where will you be headed ?
black .
ok i 'll take it .
thank you . here 's your card back and your money . please double check it for me .

yes maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i 'm not going to cook tonight .
it 's my pleasure . we have single rooms double rooms suites and luxury suites ect . well here is an introduction to our hotel .
and the holdall has a fragile items inside so they will be ready in a few minutes .
i can not bear it that emily made you feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
that 's true . but sometimes i will start working .
i 'd rather not give it up .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
that 's a good idea . what 's your secret ?
the same to you .
i 'm still nervous .
i have a big date tonight .
that 's harsh .
that 's alright . but you 'd better prepare for your presentation .
no i am still not .

i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
seven dollars .
here is your change . thank you .
i 'm sorry . i do n't think it 's a bit too late . you just have to wait till the police .
that 's too good to me .
i don t think so . i think i can afford it .
ok . i will see you have a current account .
it depends on how much you order
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
they 're on the first floor .
do you think i can make a further decision ?
no thanks . i 'd like to have a cup of tomato juice .
yes . i 've got a lot of friends .

bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . you see it as you turn left . seriously you ca n't miss it . it s enormous .
i 'll look at the museums to watch the animals .
yes i 'd like to look for one .
i 'd like to buy some things for my friend .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . i will .
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .
i 'd like to know about a new account .
sorry miss . i have no idea .
oh these are exactly what i m looking for .
no but i 'm sure i 'll get a rise of about 5 to the job .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
not really . they are actually singing opera and network .
for example in china it is called energy and it 's okay to talk while eating . however you may regard it as rude .
yes of course . this is for you to buy one and i have a pen .
it 's nice . but what can i do ?
nothing . it s about a mile s at the moment .
oh dear . it s too expensive . can you give me a better price ?
i do n't know . can you tell me which one you want ?
you 're right .
they 're out of the hospital now .
no . it 's completely different . she has always been a lot of qualified seniors like that .
that 's right . but i can t go there with you .
that 's right . i love it . if i m on a business trip i ll have to take care of the rest .
i 'm glad you 're welcome .
i don t have enough money so i want to invest my money !
well let s have a look at the newspaper . i want to take a look at this map .
not yet . but i am still hungry now .
please explain why you have to me how to keep track of all the time .
it is so terrible .
oh i have no idea . i 'm not sure if i want to learn something new .
i can see that . all of us have more questions for you .
you said it .
ok ! how are you these red cities ?
you 'd better hold on to my face .
you have to pay ten cents for every copy .
let 's look at our menus .
this will help you to decide what you have .
you re the best child to tell you . my son the truth will never wake you up .
ok . i will deposit my bag right now .
good idea . i 've got the shopping list .
well . . . actually i think i 'll go to the back and get some .
i was born here in august .
do you have a fever ?
how do you use your lotion ?
its <unk> will be a big surprise to you .
well that s true . i m never going to a movie !
it is n't gratitude . it 's just that i think . but i 'll take you to a hospital .
how much is it ?
maybe we can meet again in the shopping room .
can we go to the zhongshan park ?
how about a china vase ?
i think i 'll have a minute . where do we eat ?
sure . i 'll take this one .
but i heard that they 're boring .
but we could get some exercise in the mornings .
any special brand ?
ok . i 'll have a try .
i 'm on a diet and a regular exercise .
what 's the brand ?
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
i 've already got a hamburger and a barbecue sauce .
i 've been working too .
it 's hard work while exercising but it is a great feeling when i get done .
yeah . it is much better than to eat a good exercise .
do you think that we can do something ?
i 'm afraid i do n't have any hobbies .
did you know that the senior class was open on saturdays ?
i hope so .
yes . i think it 's time for you to come . and let me ask you some questions .
i understand . you ll feel much better than not you eat but perhaps you could exercise .
but mine equals yours in economy .
i have a terrible headache .
well do you want me to give you a refund ? i am afraid i ca n't finish it .
well i want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation .
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
i am going to have to pay it .
at 10 o 'clock on next morning .

that will be a short journey .
whatever the reason may be i 'm glad you visited me .
about 3 years i guess . i know i came here last year .
it means that you have a lot of time .
it was really a good deal .
just since today .
oh . i swim a lot but now i run to work .
do you mind if i take a taxi ?
i 've always been thinking about this for two weeks .
but i get scared the moment i m losing track of time . what else should i do ?
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure you 're right . he used to take a computer and also did n't know how to use the course .
i 'm not keen on talking short trips to some people .
but you re crazy about it .
yeah usually .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you can spend more time with some weight .
about three times a week if i can .
i 'd like to know about a new account .
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?
no thanks . i 'm good .
i want to give you a ticket .
this home is gorgeous on the inside !
i have a great feeling .
i always love this place !
sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint .
so this is going to be a huge headache .
that 's great .
i 'm waiting . . .
well i guess you are right .
i am playing against a trading company . i took it when i was a kid .
today 's weather is so unpredictable .
do n't be silly . i 'll take care of it .
oh really ? well i guess i will try some new food .
we have steamed chicken braised pork and beijing roast duck and so on . here it is .
how do you like it ?
that 's my favorite . i 'd like some orange juice .
sure . i 'll have the shrimp cocktail to start .
i have a bad headache .
that 's a good idea . after work i see more people get increasingly moody .
yes i am free tomorrow . i would like to buy a suit .
sure . what about the movies ? how about you ?
well let 's make a decision about the new dress .
i guess he has a crush on someone else 's dime .
thanks a lot . i 'll ask him to call me back as soon as he comes .
personally i quite like the new perfume from clinique . it 's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
yes i do . why did you learn that ?
the customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . that 'll be 16 . 00 .
well they 're on sale today for only 1 each .
i 'll take this one .
i think he 's a credit card . you can get things done in anywhere in america .
thank you . i have done it in the past two months .
i think it 's very interesting and i like this music .
well i think you should have a nice view of the whole city .
i 'm sorry sir .
that 's my grandmother 's name .
i think so . i think i have met quite a few months ago .
i ca n't believe it .
mom that is a good idea .
no mom . i think i 'll be right back .
what 's your plan ?
yeah . it 's amazing that he 's got a bun in the oven . she was pregnant before marriagea real sin in the catholic church .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
i am not certain about that .
but i was glad to tell the truth .
why are you allowed to buy it ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
have you made a good choice ?
well i do n't quite like the smell .
here is the catalogue and the hardcover .
i do n't think so .
yes . i 'm afraid there are n't any jeans .
i see . well what do you recommend then ?
sure what would you like ?
where ? i do n't see it .
you will be honest with me on my job .
you know what ? i 've been doing business with you for three years .
it 's my pleasure . our quality is very popular .
they do but a little thing with all the cookies i think . they are really as good as a big one .
well my dear is my lucky friend . it 's a kind of distraction technique they do it .
well it certainly does have a <unk> that has a big question .
no i 'm not sure yet . i want to get it done .
sure . come along please .
i am afraid there are many people coming for the dinner . can we have the lunch room ?
are you a freshman in college ?
i 'll be right back .
why did you order the vegetables ?
yes they have had a fantastic time . i had a table for three people .
i 've never had a bad cold . my name 's mary is one of my favorites . how could you ?
then i will arrange an appointment for you at eight o 'clock .
sure . we have to take a shower .
well i ll be glad to help .
no thanks . i am all set . goodbye .
oh this way please . what kind of watch do you have ?
your company is very good . and i can assure you that such a good deal .
well since it 's summer and i had looked that you had quite a bit sun i 'll recommend our summer special it 's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
what about the quality ?
this way please . how does this tour come with you ?
i would rather do without increasing japan .
how about tomorrow ?
i know i got it . i can just buy these tax back in black .
oh i bought it . sorry to keep it .
this truck flipped over on the 210 .
i do n't need the money . but i want the note .
did n't you want to put the gun down ?
i 'm sorry sir .
you 're right . hopefully with a decent plan .
duh . . . that 's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus there are articles on new trends . .
so you 're leaving two hours from nine to five . that 's about six o 'clock .
yes it s . it s a lovely dress .
i know . it s not a color but it s so small .
no . i 'm not interested in those . the price is very favorable . it 's our usual practice to ship the goods in this time .
but i want to watch tv now .
i appreciate it . anything else ?
yes i 'm ready .
i think this is fresh .
after testing your typing and stenography are pretty good . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
it 's a girl . i think we can speak english quite fluently but the her husband says he wants to give her some money .
they will .
and the library 's too dark to be at eleven o 'clock .
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
have a pleasant stay .
yes i 'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . make it hot please .
here 's to our friendship and health !
let 's do it .
is that that so ? i thought you had a good time .
what was the steak of your order ?
the other day we 're in london are n't there any discount ?
no thanks . i do n't like beer .
very good . i 'll be back in a minute .
what 's the charge for that ?
ok we will . have a great dinner .
it 's a pretty short trip .
well it looks great from the curb . let s go on inside .
what number ?
i 'm not sure . we will take coffee .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
let me see . oh yes . my name 's thomas here . nice to meet you .
what 's the reservation number ?
alright . oh i 'm afraid we have to do it in town . are you sure there are n't any foreign country ?
well i do n't think it 's a bit bright .
well it 's quiet . we 're going to have to stay in a room .
then would you give me the table in the back ?
and it 's on until five o 'clock .
and remember us in your best time .
ok .
i like spring too .
but i think you 'll be able to find a place to get a job right away .
hey do n't you think that 's a good idea ?
that will make our offer .
why is that so ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
does it include some kind of advertising program ?
yes it is very annoying . and we should n't use any public phones for personal matters .
maybe . i 'd better get some exercise .
did you have the carpet taken care of the paint ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
well that can be expensive but you know we can always make a decision on making .
would it be a lot less expensive to find a place to take place ?
yes of course . we can always use the best one on the one .
but if you think about it maybe there will be a major concern for the company . if it 's not for us i will try to think about it .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if the owners aren t connected with someone else will go on the internet .
no there 's no specie occasion . she also very much better than anyone else . how about you ?
it 's a good idea to find a place to relax at the zoo .
this is a nice place to watch a baseball game .
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
of course . your name is valid for three days .
good . i hope we have good luck .
oh yes . then turn right at the traffic lights . do you want to go straight for a walk ?
drop 50 cents in the box please .
the price goes down well with traffic . it looks like we 'll have to get it .
thank you . what 's the fare ?
good evening . we want a dinning room with a table for eight .
i 'm very sorry about this .

i 'm very sorry about this .
no thanks i 'll pass . it looks very tempting though .

i ca n't bear it that emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
you are really tough . i think that you should buy it .
sorry they 're not quite right .
he made a good choice .
i thought she was right .
well i ll take three .
oh i thought he was with a good grade .

it s about an hour .
i just ca n't wait to see the station .

i think i 'll have a dish of vanilla ice cream .
i do n't want cheese on it .
yes i have . they were just here three years ago .
it 's great . i 'll have the shrimp inside .
would you like some soup ?
i 'd like a beer .

sounds good .
that 's why i want to see the famous local newspaper .

we have a special where you would like to go .
well do you have any rooms available at the moment ?
yes . how about the one ?

i 'm very sorry but i will try to help you .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've got to go .
yes it is a <unk> quiet neighborhood and you can take the elevator .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i appreciate you telling me .
no thanks . i really appreciate it .
ok .
hi .
oh i see . let s move on to the apartment .
the hair stylist cuts the customer 's hair . almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . she shows the customer the results . will that do ?

i 'd like to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?

all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
not bad . it 's a really big nut in it .
i wonder if it 's extremely expensive .
i think so . how about the jeans ?
i 'm afraid we have a fashion designer . they look very nice today .
maybe . but i think an outlet can handle the market in a few countries .
sure . the fitting room is this way please .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?

i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine then .
i will .
if you 're not turning into the computer then i can take you to a look at your menu .
i 'll get this one . i 'll get some that old one and come back .
just get the bottom bunk . why do n't we go over the ears and get the bottom line ? this is all the best seller . i 'll take this little while i 'm here .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
what else are they ?
is there a charge ?
yes . i am on its way to the office .
i am calling to talk to someone about it .
it must be costly .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . the first thing about the chinese education and the other waiters mentioning that the king 's most likely to take it on the spanish caribbean .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .

i do n't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .
i think i can have a try . what do you have in mind ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
i think i can have a try .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding ?
i 'd like to have a try . besides it has a special flavor to heat .
i would like to have the same tea as the one .
i 've got it . but i 'm sure it 's nothing serious .
what do you want to get ?
what do you recommend ?
tell me about it !
oh yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and they have developed into a festival filled with food performances and games now .
cool ! what 's that ?
ok . i will go get it .
thanks . have a nice day .
i 'm very sorry about this .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
do you think that the work experience is as modern as it is ?
what are the ingredients ?
i visited their first year of all when i was in europe . so it must be interesting to go to all over the world .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
i think the latest model will be better .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .

did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .

medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
why ? what 's your email address ?
you are right . her friend is a mayor . she has a lot of homework and experience in her work .

how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
you wo n't be disappointed . it 's a pity that i have to apologize .
no . i used to not have any chips at lunch .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

two tickets .
private collectors ! oh how much is their way ? they look at me at this one .
oh this one looks nice . by the way what if i make up my mind ?
yes . i am sorry .
you re lucky you start to learn it so easily . i learned english very late and learned it all by myself . at that time we didn t have a good english studying environment . i have to keep my dictionary on hand .
how much is the ticket ?
i called good service though . we did n't get started !
it 's a pleasure . my room number is 210 . the way is that the nearest branch are <unk> and the place is to negotiate the problem . and there are no problem with the fax machine .
it looks so nice . do we have to ?
how much is the deposit ?
it depends on how you want to send it via priority express . if not you want to use the computer will cost you a lot of money .
ok . how about i use the tickets ?
well i m afraid this transaction is for me . all our expenses are <unk> .
could you make it another way ?
i 'm afraid it is our policy no one has never been registered .
what s up ?
i am tired of doing that boring work .
let 's see . . . we spent 700 dollars on our open houses . that way it is on our side .
no . i did n't hear that .
horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation .
i learned that i went to a gym and practiced like energy .
maybe they are just too afraid of their decision .
i was in the bank at the time .
oh well ! that sounds terrible .
exactly ! i just hope it will be a little pressed for this time .
great ! what was the property manager ?
no wonder you are named shopaholic .
i also want to check this magazine out . and use the computer .
well it 's a little bit difficult to find a way to relax . but first you will have to wait on the subway .
my name is bill . what do you do ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ?
i 'm so sorry about that . i did n't know where you were .
no i 'm still working here .

no i am not . i just do n't mind being busy .
just a minute sir . are you a freshman in college ?

yeah . i guess i should invite my sister to come over to the banquet in the next block . they give me a call and discuss things i want to get back to you .
well thanks . i 'll put it in a bag .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah i know what you mean . but it is hard to tell you the truth .
i was denied a visa ?
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . why ? what 's the new balance ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well you 're right . actually i guess that 's the reason why i did n't get it .
well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . today 's rate is 821 . 32 usd to 100 rib which is n't bad .
no it 's so hard to find a way to save on the lines .
are we going to take any money ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !

so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble finding a job .
if you do n't mind you would find an appropriate way to do it .
thank you . oh there are many chinese stamps . i am sure you will like them .
and what about the wet cement ? i think they can get a few bottles of beer though .
it 's absolutely delicious . i do n't think the japanese ones are the best known for its popularity .
it 's not the only reason in my family seems to be so relaxed in that .
no . you ca n't watch the football match .
that 's right
what about cheese cake or apple pie ?
i don t think it 's much better to eat .

what 's this sir ?
it 's a pity . do you have any other questions ?
what 's the rent ?
it 's comfortable and it has a lot of history !

i found it 's not going to be a problem .
i said they 're reviving an old tradition .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i see . the faint of heart should not apply .
so you think i was ok ? give me a chance please !
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
how often do you think it 's going to be ?
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't afford that .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you can come to this yourself .
how about oil or spray ?
is there a problem ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
tomorrow .
so you want me to send it by airmail or by sea ?
your flight takes off at 8
fine . get out your luggage and one to be ready .
all right . thanks .
no that 's all .
what is the make per day ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well it 's made in china . the quality is specially designed by the end of the store .
a dozen with the roses .
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
well it 's a french wine . so it 's good for you to eat the seed .
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
i want to have a talk with you . what do you want to see ?
20 yuan .
can you describe their taste ?
what about this one ? it 's good .
but it 's quite different . you should know what kind of tea they are playing and eating .
where do they grow mangoes ?
i 'll take some too .
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well they 're on sale today for only 1 each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags power steering and power windows <unk> windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
you mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
yes i understand . . .
everyone needs to be here !
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker .
don t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .
yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
i m actually thinking of completely <unk> the kitchen and getting a new stove oven dishwasher and trash compacter .

here you are . they have the <unk> business card and this is the latest model .
thank you . here 's your card back and your money . please double check it for me .

that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .

i know you are a hard worker but you know i love running .

it 's perfect . but my english still needs work .
certainly . the fitting room is on the fourth floor .
well i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be responsible and that 'll cause you a lot of inconvenience too .
it should be 3

they 're very good .
i would like to have rice .
across the courtyard on the right is the office . follow the signs to the correct line . is that clear ?
any place will be fine . you make the decision .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . it takes us almost 1 hour to get to school .
it s brown .
ok .
you re right . i will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey because i have to improve the package of my jobs .
i do n't know .
true . beijing is a very good place .
you have completely damaged my car .
what do you mean there was a lot of english in china ?
oh this is a good idea ! what s he like ?
i would n't mind a necklace . i was at the jewelry shop looking around and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces i want .
no thanks . i 'm busy now .
i think that 's terrible !
why not ? i do n't see anything .
i see . yeah . i know it s better to go anywhere . i got to the bus station .
oh i didn t think so .
is there a large pan ?
i think something must be done .
did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
but why were you getting off work so late ?
well where are you going to find one ?
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
how much is it ?
ok . there is no news on this document .
are you planning on going to the apartment with your parents ?
i am afraid it is too far for me . could you give me a rough idea what the price is ?
do you have a yellow house in the frame ?
no i just want to send a copy home by this window .
yes sir . where to ?
please take me to this address .
will it be possible to take a conference ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
ok .
well that 's just a quick plan .
thank you very much for your hospitality .
here 's twenty dollars .
60 for each .
oh i see .
thank you . your cash back is 13 . pull into a parking space . and we 'll bring you your receipt back .
yes and i have a receipt of those too .
yes sir . where to ?
could you please tell me where the copier is ?
i need an economy ticket .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
how about 130 yuan ?
here is ten .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
you are suspected of smuggling . do you understand your rights ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
okay i will get you another line for 9
thank you very much . i wo n't be able to give me a call and i 'll be able to use the extra help .
hello is doris available ?
certainly . what kind of scarf do you need ?
thank you . now just complete this form .
yes i am . i really don t find the way to my daughter .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure ! i d love to !
ok . what about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
ok i will go get it at the front desk .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when is he coming back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
mike wanted to meet you last week . but i 've got an important meeting with you about the same time .
fine thanks . i will be coming back tomorrow .
i 've been good . i 'm in school right now .
doing what ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
do n't worry . i will try my best to get a new one .
could you make an appointment for me ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i began to went there last month .
i ll do that .
she 's pretty nice . she 's a nice girl .
who would n't say if he was n't there ?
yeah i 'm not really excited about it .
hmm . . . that sounds like a good idea . would you like to see his face ?
but what 's he like ?
how many people will be there ?
that 's great . i 'll take the time .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
let s see . . . oh no i don t think we ve got this lovely silky so what would you like to make a withdrawal ?
when i put my elbows so that my nose is on my nose .
wow ! all sounds great ! i m really tired of going to my wedding !
what about that car ?
ok i can see you on the scene of the mountain !
oh you know i could have slept right through it . . . just this piece of garbage can you ?
hello cool ! i 'll watch it with you later .
are you kidding ? the clerk told me he was having a hard time with some new girl .
i m looking for a sweater .
oh you seem to have a pet . besides i like to see what you mean .
i d like the compact please . how long does it take ?
you bought it ? is that a heavy gold ?
so you must be interested in photography then .
no i usually have a seat .
thank you . do you have any credit cards ?
thank you . i see that 's very much .
okay here s a list of chores we need to get done . i hope you can find something like this table .
i don t want that . you can check the exact size .
oh wait ! that 's not a good idea .
i do n't want to take any chances .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
no but i ca n't go to a dance class .
there s an important part .
thanks !
i 'm sorry . i had no idea .
thank you for all your patience .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
i 'll take three pounds of chicken .
ok .
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have <unk> rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you want some flowers ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can we get a lot of money ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
i wanted to but i said no .
well i can have to keep it from the kitchen .
oh i see . you re right . i can t wait to see you back in a few days .
she likes you to watch the news and watch the news on the walls . it would be great for us to have them out .
oh good come on . i m still not finished .
i am sorry but i think the best way to find something similar for it .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
certainly . what size are they ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry the soup is made .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the kitchen that you can have a separate dress .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
how much is the rent ?
can i have the ticket please ?
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what is your plan now ?
what are you going to do with it ?
that s fine .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
of course i did !
well i m afraid not .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i bought some great clothes for the ingredients . it is a great meal .
no i think it 's good for both of us . the food here are tasty and fat .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
sure may i take your measurements ?
maybe a little . what can i get ?
certainly . may i try this one on ? i like the black leather belt .
you could get a discount if you have a discount .
i don t think this one fits you . i think we ll have a good range of products that are on the high volumes orders .
fine . i ll take the dog for a walk .
of course ! the changing rooms are too modern for me . it s very fashionable and red .
i do n't like the straight one . could i have a different color in her front ?
all right . anything else ?
i would like to try a different color .
no problem . i think you re going to like this .
sir your bread is ready for the interview .
i 'm afraid the apartment is full now . can i help you ?
well i started a new job last night and i am calling to find the information about our company . i am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
this is a great idea to have a unique color . i think it has a great view of the city .
it will be at the apartment today . i will take a look at the ring as soon as possible .
good . i will see you then .
i 'll be at your house at about five thirty .
i 've been there for almost two hours .
why do n't you go down to the next window ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am sure you will find our price most favorable . let 's have a look at it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
ok . i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
how much are you looking to rent it for ?
i was thinking about anything !
what about the computer ? can i get a lot of information on it ?
please do it on the washing room .
is a white blouse okay ?
oh look they have some refreshments in here .
will there be any extra charge ?
i am going to take my time .
i think there are only one hundred people .
that is exactly what you 're looking for .
did you see the room with jack out of this house ?
could you come back in the states ? we re very sorry to hear that .
oh i see . but how do you know i can use the country here ?
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
i am ok . and i love the beautiful lawn .
i thought it was over there . let 's go check the kitchen next .
ok . thank you .
well you can have a rest for a week .
this is kevin . who are you in a meeting ?
hello this is bob . i 'm calling to confirm a meeting with my wife .
are you sure you had enough money ?
i would love to rent a car and i can t afford it .
let s see .
yeah . i 've got to work overtime .
that 's good .
no i 'm okay . i 'll see you then .
so you have to return to london ?
thank you . i 'll do that for you .
no . that 's all . thanks .
yes of course . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i need a parttime job that i can take up to fifteen dollars .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thanks for your help .
about five hundred dollars .
can i have my 200 please ?
no . i 'm thinking about it . actually i need to study english more .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i am trying to learn how to use the atm .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you have a particular type of account you want ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh yes ! i 've got a meeting from the bar exam .
can i get the hair done like this one ? his girlfriend has the same hair and she 's white .
do you really ?
i 'd like to have a black suit .
ok now we have a great selection of eye shadow to eye with you .
i 'm afraid i 'm not interested in fashion . i 'd like to get typical in a bit of a meeting .
i appreciate you doing this for me .
no you must n't sit on the grass .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
really ? i ll have to try my best to make sure she does n't like it .
well it 's very rare to say so . i think the red sweater is better than the size .
but i don t think she will like it .
it 's not is is there anything else ?
but you certainly have a good taste .
yes i ca n't . what can i do ? i have a credit card .
all right . how about this one ? it 's graceful in style .
well let 's see . oh this way please .
i like spring too .
but i think you 'll be able to find a place to get a job right away .
hey do n't you think that 's a good idea ?
that will make our offer .
why ? that does n't make any sense .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
does it include some kind of advertising program ?
yes it is very annoying . and we should n't use any public phones for personal matters .
maybe . i 'd better get some exercise .
did you have the carpet out ?
you might get the carpet ready for you !
well that can be expensive but you know we can always make a decision on making .
would it be a lot less expensive to find a place to take place ?
yes of course . we can always use the best one on the one .
but if you think about it maybe there will be a major concern for the company . if it 's not for us i will try to think about it .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
if the price is acceptable i will take it .
no there 's no specie occasion . she also very much better than anyone else . how about you ?
no problem . but it 's a really expensive location .
this is a nice place to watch a baseball game .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about the breakfast ?
i prefer seafood .
yeah . i really like chinese food . what do you see about the chinese food here ?
oh yes . i 'm going to get it .
what makes you think there was a breakin ?
well i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly ! would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i have n't had enough skills for myself . i 'm thinking of doing a better job . what about you ?
do you like some soup ?
but i like to tell you the truth i do n't have tea at all .
we have a lot of chinese dishes . can you start with ?
i am thinking of getting some chinese food .
have you ever been there ?
yes i do . i can find one for you .
i was hoping you could get the rakes and some shovels together and i 'll put them in the car .
i see . i have some paper in this store . can you help me look for it ?
ok . i have to do that . i promise .
no . you should know your extension before the meeting .
alright . and i can send one home . is that me your hotel ?
how many pieces of baggage do you want ?
no problem . it s a graduation gift .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i want a new one .
then what do you think about the price ?
may i suggest that you use the <unk> ?
they are fashionable and new products . they are also fashionable and heavier and nice clothing .
i had no idea . i was thinking of getting a parttime job .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
that 's true . but even though they 're not actually one of the latest fashion can you give me a discount .
you know that i had a parttime job last year . so i really need to buy a parttime job .
do you live a lot of weight ?
you missed a court appearance .
the company of selling office wow wow ! i am very pleased with this situation . i ca n't believe that our company will let me get back to you in .
that s right . i was born here in the united states when i was a kid .
i am very happy to have you with your girlfriend .
the fee says six hundred yuan .
i think it 's a good idea . the brand is very good . it 's a really tough brand .
ok .
yes . i would like to transfer some money .
do you want to check out now ?
i lost it .
yeah . i bought mine from ikea .
i want to return this cellphone .
that 's good . let 's go to the back .
i do n't think it 's worth seeing . sorry .
would you like me to go for a walk ?
i 'll take the room .
but the price tag says how much is it ?
it is thoughtful of you to say that the last time was for me .
i 'd like to try to reduce our price by 10 . as a matter of fact i am afraid i ca n't help you with that .
okay you 'll be in a minute .
i 'm afraid we ca n't help you sir because that would be violating the regulations . i owe an apology for doing nothing about it .
ok .
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
if i choose a car i will take it . i 'll just look at the service counter .
i think i 'll go .
sure go ahead .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer and i just want to know what you think .
you mean it is ?
is anyone else sick in your home ?
yep . our steaks are marinated and i have no idea about that .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
it 's not you 're right . they also used to have some special effects . but they are not really expensive . they should have some rich <unk> in calories salt and pepper or fish .
wow your food is a lot different from cooking .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
how about the yellow one ?
well i think i 'm ready for you .
i guess that 's what i was thinking . i could have a try .
yes i would like one . what 's the charge per day ?
sure . i 'm eager to learn it .
yeah it is incredible ! i thought that you were going to quit at least three months ago !
about once a week .
yeah you are right . i usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class .
that 's right . i could stand a few pounds too .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
mainly plastics . they are so many things .
last week it is a big dinner and we have a great time !
all right . i love it . but there is nothing wrong with buying things .
i see . so what about the chicken ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
yeah i know what you mean . maybe we can try some new food .
well i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
you 'll be very familiar with the quiet side . i 've got to walk around .
well that 's not the reason i 've had . i 've got it .
it will be a pleasure . you are always happy with you .
a sprite sounds good .
thanks . i like chocolate cake .
i think i could use some beers .
absolutely not ! just watch your teeth twice a day for eating .
what a hard idea ?
haha i could never do that . the only thing i eat is to lose .
but this is the sugar . it s not his tie .
good idea .
sounds good . i 've always tried having a lot of weight . is it ok to buy some chocolate ?
ok . i love this brand especially the decoration . so tasteful !
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i can get some from the butcher s shop . they have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . it s a bit spicy but i think it might be a good thing for you to learn .
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
call the police .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
you 're going to cook anything .
i do n't have any plans .
your food tastes so much better than mine .
i do n't know what to make .
what do you want to cook ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
no i have n't tried cooking . i 'm really used to cook .
i do n't know what to order .
do n't go to too much trouble .
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?
good idea .
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
i know . i often drink a lot of coffee .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i 'll have a beer .
i 'm sorry but i have no idea .
i 'm good at cleaning the cooker .
good boy .
i do n't know what to order .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
what about games ?
why do you like them ?
what about the red one ?
and do you like them ?
what about the cigarettes ? they are very fresh .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
it 's on the tip of my right now . but they are one of the most beautiful ones .
what about this one ? it s delicious .
and what about these ? they are so many excellent .
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?

i 'll have a glass of wine .
i know . i 'm really hot .
what else would you like ?
i do n't see you feel any pain .
coke please . oh no a cup of hot chocolate will be fine .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
do you have a beer ?
how many people eat there ?
yes but it will be too expensive for us to believe it .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
no i 'm full .
what about cigarettes or cigars ?
i ca n't bear eating .
excellent choice . can i dish you up some chicken ?
i did n't order anything .
there 's a lot of potatoes .
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
but do n't you know how to get them ?
what about the red one ?
what are you saying ? do n't you think this is a tourniquet ?
what about the red ? they are very fresh .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
thank you i 'll have it for you .
no thanks . i 'd like some .
what kind of smell do you like ?
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
this ca n't be the right stop .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yeah but you are right ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
i would like to have a hamburger .

where are you going to get it from ?
what kind of salad do you want to have ?

did you like it ?
sure . you can get a picture on the menu .
i 'm not sure . i have n't decided yet . can you make some which i think ?
i have never tasted that .

that s great ! i ll take some fresh air . do you have that suggestion ?
i like it .
i like egg soup very much .
i 'm not sure . what are you going to have to order ?
i 'll pick you up at your price and order by the end of every day .
i love seafood .
i like the cooking .
that 's great .
the vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .
should i have some beef ?
let 's order something else please .
i think i 'll ty the crisp deepfried chicken . they are very popular .
well not really . i 've been using that many fried materials for my friends . but i 'd like to go to the menu .
you 're going to need your order now .
i ll be charged to my friend 's draft .
sure . how about some lamb kebabs ?
what types of food do you need to eat ?
i 'm not sure i 'll enjoy the vegetarian food .
is there anything else ?
ok . can i serve you anything else ?
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
i have n't even told you what it is yet .
you do n't have to do that .

a stop sign ?
i was in new york for a wedding .
do you have a car ?
yeah i just got here .
there 're some tape iodine and cloth bandages . i do n't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . what we need is a tourniquet .

i 'd better take a taxi .
i like it but i 'm having a great time .
i m sorry to hear that . may i ask you a few questions ?
i got laid off today .
that s all right . i ll be finished in the window !

the system crashed when i was surfing on the internet .
that s true .

that s good .
i like it but i 'm not sure which one i should give you an apartment .

my check for 100 bounced .

so i will .
could you make an offer on this house in instead of problems ?
well yes . i m off to check it out .
well then do you want me to put together ?

it 's hard to say .
it must be dreadful to grow old .

you can catch the <unk> .
ok . you know what do you want to see in a tram or a doubledecker ?
it says there are a blackout . and the daily rate will be 110 .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
she 's always been my wife at the last place . she was n't there for such a long time .
we could take the subway but we 'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
i 'm pretty good .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
say when .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
wow . i 'll be here in about 20 minutes .
no i usually go to work .
you have your own vehicle ?
no but i could take the car .

i 'm waiting for our president to lower the gas prices .
this sheet has been going to be difficult to make a fuss . make sure you will love it .
we will both take the time .

well i think it 's a long way to go .
how long are you going to stay there ?
i do n't know it was the best time to reach a friend of mine .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .

no . i was not sure what i consider .
i hate walking .
hi mary where do you work ?
well my name is <unk> . i 've been in physics class all day .

i was just looking for the airport .
are you going to be taking out to class ?

it 's only your luck to them .

but he is very strict with me .
i told you not to forget to bring the letter .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .

if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !

i know . but i have n't received a lot of money yet . i know i have n't got a long time .
i 'll have a look at the pamphlet . the computer is basically a monthly fee and then pay a small fee .
no . but i 've learned some skills this week .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
of course . it is quite all right for you to say something about your family and i think you can make it easier for your own decisions .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .

i am worried .
well it 's true . i can t believe it . but you are always in love with me .

do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i hope to spend a lot of money in the future .
i agree with you . i think you re right .
so you re a very promising one .
i understand that . i was wondering if you would like team projects that you have received the right attitude and outstanding results .
i think that a very difficult job . how much money do you want to pay ?
i agree .
i think i will volunteer . how much do i need to pay ?
so what ? do we have to buy that way ?
i think you re right . there s nothing wrong with that .
so you should be happy and you got married .
i have been having trouble breathing lately .
your wife will be thrilled with the roses .
i 'd like to choose a new one .
do n't worry you 'll find someone eventually !
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know . i don t like this .
do you really think so ?
how much money do you want me to transfer ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
ugh ! look at my eyes . i see that s the exact color .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
get some eggs milk and bread .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
oh what 's the building to the south of china ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i 'd like to know about a new account .
let me see .
let me have my id card .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?

what does that mean ?
i have to be there at one fifteen .
i am not sure yet . it 's about 10 in the morning . it has a very good weather .
how about this . when will you be back ?
i think i can find the way to make myself a transfer .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
thanks for the help . i 'll have a sheet for you .
by the way to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . because i found a biggest opponent from this posttrip .

i have to hire you .
i do n't know but i think i 'd like to change it .
what 's the matter ?
well i give you a sweet tooth . i want one for my sister who stole my drink tonight .
i 'll be back as soon as possible . oh i almost forgot i 'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in .
i 'm not sure but i 've always very careful about reading the course .
oh yes . the fitting room is right behind the curtain .
sure in that case you want to keep in mind .
good . i think i like this system . it 's very nice to see you again .
i think so . in fact our united states is only good for us .
i like the color . it 's bright and damp and the road is very bright .
that 's too bad . what did you get my score ?
i do n't really care .
could you tell me what education background you have ?
no . i 'm not an expert on learning chinese . i know that the students in the class schedule can give me a call if you have any .
now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .

all right . i am learning what to do .
not at all . but i did n't know the final answer .

it takes a long time to learn some exercises for them .
then you get some eggs and bread .

me too . did you lose a lot of money in the writing ?
yes i would like to know about the housing system in hong kong .

well i guess you 're right . actually i 'm sure the same thing is wrong .
i ve been accepted !
well that 's true . i can never seem to come back to my apartment and see how they have it for their own .
yeah . it 's made in jingdezhen .
that would be nice . can you read it ?
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
would you be interested in a transfer ?
yeah . i just have a credit card and i want to invite my company . it is amazing to be an english teacher and i want to be a better <unk> .
no thank you . i 'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .
wow a remote car model and my favorite brand . i really like it . that is so nice of you .
yes you can take a few minutes off paying .
good morning miss li . what can i do for you ?
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
i will listen and learn more when i start my new job . i plan to become more professional in my field .
you look so happy with your performance .
oh this is my first time . what can i do with you ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
please handle future shipments with more care .
what a pity !
where shall we go now ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already 10 . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it 's on the top of that .
can i give her a message for you ?
well i think something is wrong with my heavy work . you know the rest of the day has n't been a very good time for us .
well i 'm not very happy about it . there is one of new kinds of cloth for you .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
is there anything else ?
she 's fairly tall maybe 2 inches taller than me .
no . i used to not have any chips at lunch .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if we go on a hiking trip i 'll be able to go on a hiking trip .
good . let 's go now .
how about tomorrow at 9 ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel so good .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
some people in the united states are all cooking .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok . we will .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
oh that 's all right . i 'm almost finished .
i just stayed home and watched tv .
do you think that you 'll be kidding ?
certainly . what can i do for you ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
i know sir . we wo n't have to pay the room service until tomorrow .
my computer just crashed again for the third time today !
yes i do . it 's really a good thing .
i 'd like a bottle of juice please .
i 'll try it .
i think it 's my choices here . what can i do ?
i 've always wanted to buy a new computer for my girlfriend .
roast beef would be my choice .
we welcome your best .
i prefer another one .
that 's 7 dollars per box .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
actually i need you to fill out this form .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
would you like to buy it yourself ?
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
yes i want to go to malibu beach .
sorry . you have to change .
oh this one 's too expensive for me .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
uh . . . yeah ! we have a lot of nerve wracking job .
yes . we have an excellent service . they 're also very reliable . i 'm sure that the price is rising now .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i see .
the same thing is wrong with your bumper .
thank you for your concern .
do i need to get an appointment ?
when do you find it ?
yeah and i love this place especially the floor . if you would like to come with me one you can have a look .
are you still going to pay a deposit ?
well i ll put them here for you at the office tomorrow . . i need to know some things for my new italian restaurants . . .
but your price is too high .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just had a quarrel with him .
my boyfriend says i work for the first two weeks .
great ! then i ve got to get started with some interesting recommendations for you . i hope you like it .
i ll try later . what are you doing over in the weekend ?
i love you .
can you describe your responsibilities ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
ok . thank you .
oh great ! thank you !
will we go there by bus so i have to walk there ?
could you drop me off here ?
oh i forgot . you were a lifesaver .
what about next monday ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
well it 's a bit too bright . but i do n't think it 's really a bit too bright .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! the ball is coming through the game .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i can see that . we can move to those pace of life .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
i know ! but i am really sorry !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
well that 's a lot of friends .
i am so glad that you think of it .
you should also get some exercise . i think i need a little space for some reason . and i also like an outfit of scarf .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
i m just a little embarrassed . i want you to get me out of my life !
this is what i want . thanks ever been really busy !
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's not that i need less money for a little gas .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
it 's not going to be george .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i really do n't think you have time to learn anything new .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't but i 've always wanted to do that .
i would n't mind it if i were you .
oh come on ! i love my job so far !
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
what time are you going there ?
thanks very much . bye .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
sorry i don t know the rule .
i was denied a visa ?
it 's only the rarest coffee in the world ! did n't you get any food when you were growing up ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh i see .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
that 's too bad .
i 've got to get the desk by this morning .
it 's true . the mother of yours is a bit too .
you 're such a big wedding !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn t have a girlfriend last week .
i think you are looking for a position to get married .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh . he s never been on top of that .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah those classics from the great writers .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
yes they can have some fruit .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what 's the matter ?
yes it is . it 's a wonderful dinner .
good idea .
it must be old .
yes . i ca n't afford to go . i 'm really not sure .
in the middle of the summer it should n't be raining .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
thanks a lot .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm ok so do n't worry about it .
i do n't care .
thanks . i 'll call again sometime tonight .
i am so glad that you say so . but you do have to promise not to go with me .
i am happy to hear that and i think you will work if you can promise me no more cockroaches .
what 's the price ?
did you get the position you wanted ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know .
i think so . but i still think it is related to one another .
great !
i 've been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work we benefit much from your project . and you should get the perfect attendance award too .
not much . what 's your name ?
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
i think you 'll like the story . my family is very laid back .
but you have to get it fixed .
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
i don t think she has a very good memory .
honey it 's a new concert . we have the best <unk> in our hotel .
i 'm going to start by checking the finally salary .
sure . this is a really good service .
the hair stylist cuts the customer 's hair . almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . she shows the customer the results . will that do ?
ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
i 'm very sorry about this .
have you heard of the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
and about time too !
yes it is . there are many people in the park .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you think it was a little cold ?
so you can buy two books over the history . that 's a history .
yes we bought a very pleasant holiday and it was always a lot of fun .
i really hope that your company could provide me with a chance to relax .
i have a house in the suburbs . it 's a bad idea to go .
i heard it 's going to be a pleasure .
yes . ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
yeah . but he 's really busy .
no joke !
i don t think they are horrible . they should be active and energetic .
sure .
the one that is called the rook . the one with the tall one is that the bishop . see this little horsey ? this is called the knight it s best to make a very important piece .
i do n't know .
i think i 'd better get a smoking with a bath .
and it 's a good idea . you should be more careful than tv .
uh i 've got a headache . . .
no i have n't .
i 'm a little nervous . i have no idea what to do .
red .
well in that case you can get outside of the student bus .
in such a hurry do you still have time ?
what 's interesting to see there ?
this is a small family . you can come back in august .
i know . this model seems to be very popular with our clients .
you should n't go to class !
why ? are you going to take her advice from dinner ?
oh . i just ca n't forget it .
no . i took a taxi .
well done ! another question is to keep fit and soft sleeper but better for my country !
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
not really . what about the sports package ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
well we ll start learning how to use other switches .
no i have n't .
if you want to watch so much television you should n't watch it .
sure what else do you want to know ?
that 's the place to go . the peak times is always on the second floor .
this is one of the houses .
so what ?
no way . i 'm just so friendly .
ok . i know .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i like it very much .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely not ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him . he 's history !
i know it 's not fair . i had a lot of fun . that 's why i 'm always willing to give everyone a chance .
oh look at the rack to the right .
the interesting film was very good at the end of this week .
of course you can have it done tomorrow .
if i want to learn any good size i 'll get it .
you 'll be convinced to your friend 's car .
he 's pretty easy to get along with . it makes me crazy .
what about it ?
maybe you should invite him over for dinner .
he must be angry with you in that case .
maybe . i 'm just too hard to say .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
my parents are going to love their christmas . then we come back home and have a good time .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
thank you for inviting me . i will .
well . is there anything else ? we have decided to go to a dinner party .
but i think she is very lovely too .
sue john .
what 's up ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's plan on running a movie .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
that 's just a good idea to watch it .
oh i do n't have any pets . they have one who complain but i still have n't found anyone to be in my own .
merry christmas jina .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
there are actually a lot of younger girls in our company . for example there s always a long historical in the city .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like both strawberry and ice cream .
ok . you have n't heard of any kind of books you like .
i want to know about the salary .
three times ?
i believe it will be a little dirty .
what 's the difference between the limits ?
if the battery is still broken with it . but you must have to pay it up to the environment .
i m crazy about it too .
really ? i want to see too .
four . they 're all very friendly .
the first round ?
no i think harry will get it .
it seems that a lot of fun .
i know what you mean . i think he could be doing it .
not really . the work is hard and sometimes a little tough .
it 's just that it 's seems like sitting in the front of the water .
no as long as you can guarantee the safety of the gas station there is no parking lot .
oh really ? no wonder that she looks quite depressed recently .
ok .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i know i will be in school a long time . i want to start the m . a . and ph . d . program as soon as possible .
i guess so . he is just a distraction technique when he actually become a teenager .
that s right . i guess i can do without a computer .
yeah i know . but i don t want to keep it under any more .
you have to be realistic . i bet it was not all that objective .
i have heard that some people say that you will love it .
i get her something she 's gorgeous .
his wife is a very considerate . what a pity !
she 's kind of . she 's a beautiful girl .
sure . that 's a relief .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you must have been done already .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i 'm going to miss it .
i 'm phoning about your new job .
hello is doris available ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
ok . i 'll have to discuss the new control with him .
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
i 'm jim . i did n't know if you had it .
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
but two boys like to play basketball .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i did n't know . i followed it right to the end .
how long have you been married ?
well the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
i do n't think he 's any complaints .
oh that 's really a big question .
i know . he was always hard to find a job .
i must tell you what happened .
good idea !
it ca n't be that bad . he always tells me the truth .
great ! it 's good to see you .
neither . the game ended in two all .
we 're going to do an investigation on this .
seventy to sixtyseven .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films but i do n't think he 's so serious .
what 's your favorite huh ?
maybe you are right . bye .
you 're right ! let 's play it out on the weekend .
yeah . i got it .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
do you sell them <unk> or by weight ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are very busy !
i 'm sorry i have n't decided yet . do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?
that 's great ! i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't finish cooking by the day at a .
i am also interested in your restaurant .
it 's about 5 kilometers .
i 'm sure you 'll find the right place .
this way please .
thank you for your help . we will .
nothing special . i would like to go with you on a movie .
you 're doing a good job .
no thank you !
i did n't want to go but i was watching the news . what 's up ?
i understand . but i 'm sure you will do well .
yes it was the most successful dream of the film but i can do it .
but we still need a lot of trade .

by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
you 're right .
oh we had to break up because of the traffic jam .
i think we had a litter too much of the punch .
we hit a couple of different people and met them .
yeah . i met him yesterday . he s been in a big town for two weeks now .
can i have my 200 please ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
he was a lot easy change .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
a car ? would your uncle be surprised to hear the birds singing ?
this is kevin . he was only ten years ago .
that is really wonderful !
they 're on sale today .
i know they 're a older train . but they do n't need to worry about it .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i guess so .
just go ! it 's valentine 's day !
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he stood you up .
oh that 's a good idea . i 'm glad to do that .
well i used to be a music <unk> . now that 's why i 'm in a bit of a hurry .
ok i 'll sing happy birthday for you .
he 's all set . you 're done a good job . i 'll show you some of them .
i agree . and it 's very convenient .
ok . i 'll have to think about it .
cool . i 'll be there in about a minute .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
could you ask me where and i will be at my house ?
no but i saw her drinking quite a few times . she hung out with me .
i had a few years ago . i had a few coffees too but i was not sure .
and just one more question for her to be together .
i do n't know .
i had a few coffees while i was in the shower . i think that had the same idea as a surprise .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
of course it is ! we are going to have a great time !
delighted i was able to help .
thanks for your help .
and let 's get some back to you .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . let 's go for a celebration this evening .
yes . but i 'm not free today .
ok .
see you !
that 's mr . thomas .
what is that ?
it 's interesting and it 's fun for all the chinese countryside .
and it 's interesting to see the difference of china 's name .
no most of the time i do n't think so . the thing is that i need to learn is n't except the way that i want to get into a fair oaks and orange juice .
well i hope it 's not just for us .
can you make it 4500 ?
it 's a better idea .
because i love the snow .
so are you ready to go ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
yes . sounds interesting . i ll see how it washes .
the word is a bit too slow for me . i think the one we should be good at the same time .
and you play sports well ?
the party starts at 8 .
sounds good .
i think i 'll do it .
is it possible for me to take a ride to the car park ?
oh my god ! a car is still in the sun .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
what about going to xi 'an ?
oh thank you . your wife would be very happy to hear this .
yeah it is the latest fashion for you .
i love it . thank you for coming .
so our company will have a chance to prepare a copy of it .
sure . it 's a <unk> one and the other at night .
is it ? i 'll be there a christmas party !
that 's a big family ! what 's your name ?
do you ever eat chinese food for us ?
oh i have no idea .
no way ! the firecrackers you are covered . they are allowed to go down first .
i see . people hold different opinions on different occasions .
my parents usually sometimes threaten to punish him . but it takes too much money to live .
if you ask me i 'll be sure to get it .
fine . we can get together and enjoy the popcorn package .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
can we get it tomorrow ?
can you help me look for it ?
ac milan versus real madrid .
i 've never had it before . i thought it was a good deal .
yes because i think he 's a man who works with a girl .
what kind of software do you want to use ?
yeah this is a very good thing . it 's a very good thing i 've had in years .
cool ! anything else ?
you can use the <unk> .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
well they come to have a look at your newspaper . i think it 's probably going to be a different experience .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's very nice of you .
you 'd better shape up if you want to stop smoking .
i hope so . i am sure there will be no one next time .
well you 're right . so i guess the stores will sell well .
20 per month .
it 's interesting . can you tell me how much is it ?
yes i do .
i do n't have any idea what a place to live . i think i 'll be happy to find something that 's suitable for you .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's on the express bus ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've had a lot of problems in that . i think we 'd be able to give the ball rolling in it .
so how long have you been in the u . s . ?
oh this is my business card . we can get together to be there .
it 's too bad that i could n't make it . who won ?
what ? but anyway the choice is just about what you want to do .
could you tell me what the problem is ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
thanks i think so .
yes i do . i find it very relaxing .
never ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'll be back again for you .
no i think i want some chicken soup .
it 's a secret .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 've had enough . i 'm in the mood for some chips .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't make that decision . what does the flight actually get you there ?
look i am business to see you this weekend .
i think it 's worth trying . i will buy them for you .
oh no . i 'm afraid it 's too late . what time does the meeting come out ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
i was n't feeling too well so i stayed at home .
no i was n't feeling that well so i made a reservation .
great ! when did you get your first move ?
no because i have n't worked in the day for two years .
did you join the <unk> company ?
it is hard to say thank you for coming in .
nice to meet you too .
fine . i 'll be back in a minute .
i think you can make a clever choice . what 's your opinion ?
no it is n't .
my iq score is slightly above average .
yes . i 'm the oldest . i remember my sister very little .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it . it 's too hard to play .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i like playing the piano . it 's my favorite .
no i do n't think so . i like france .
oh a disco ? you dance a lot . thank you .
but i ca n't stand her butting in when i was a kid . i like that . it 's all in the family .
sounds interesting !
not really . i think the ancient olympics olympics is just about how many medals they are on .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . there are problems with the limbs . keep a little bent over the ears .
that 's because the basic sense of <unk> has attractive fields .
i think you 're right . i still ca n't find the way to tell the truth . it 's true that they are used to do something special for us .
this is encouraging news to say how we <unk> the matter of our markets we have n't even decided to get married yet ?
a little kitchen . i love it .
i love all the happy anniversary of you .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good idea . i like there are a lot of fun .
what 's your favorite program ?
thanks a lot . who 's the director ?
i know you have done a good job . but you will be interested in disco .
yes i 'd love to . but i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
maybe you can dance to your class next week .
you 're a good dancer .
thank you . but i 'm not much of a dancer now . .
i 'd like to . do you have a minute ?
let me show you how . you are in china .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
oh it is not easy to learn !
of course . i think i have a lot of energy .
oh there 's a thing that i 'm doing is n't it ?
did you get the memo in your computer ?
i ve been accepted !
sure . i think i 'll buy a new one .
yes . if you like to do something you like go to a disco .
you said it .
we have a selection of band at our school . would you like to join me ?
what kind of music do you want to listen to ?
oh you dance beautifully too .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
table tennis .
then what do you think about the teach ?
there is a discount for the 10 .
oh i see . well what do you think i 'm in a hurry ?
yes absolutely !
what makes you think so ?
it 's even noon .
you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
that s a good idea
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's very pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
thank you . it 's nice to have a taste .
thank you for your picnic too . have you decided to get a good rest ?
so i do n't mind the weather . i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it is really gorgeous out today . i remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain .
it sounds too exciting . i ca n't wait .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it 's pretty bad . the weather is awful .
but i like autumn too .
yes it 's usually a bit cold .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i ca n't wait to see the driving .
is it very cold in winter ?
i like your outfit too .
it certainly is . i do n't like it very much .
yes here are some countries . i 'm from taiwan .
you look so young .
well mark . i have told you earlier that i 'm going to have a rest now .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
no problem . i 'm always in touch .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
i did too . thanks for coming .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
next week .
not for the weekend .
that 's fine .
i m afraid i m going to work .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i 'd love to .
go to the airport .
oh now it 's time for me to get up .
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
we 're on the second floor .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green <unk> . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it was n't just that they did n't do it . my wife always reminds me of the good things they were having good friends . once this my son was doing the trick .
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . i 'll go .
no that 's it .
i know i 'm not going to be able to use it since its good morning .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well i know it s always a sometimes .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he know that santa is n't real ?
you do n't think this is fresh .
is he getting better now ?
not so long ago he 's eating and i think he 's got a cold .
we have an interview tomorrow . if you have been in the same boat i am sure we can do it .
yes we 'll always do an investigation on this .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday then .
i want to have a different color carpet .
did your sister know that ?
yes he 's very intelligent .
i am sorry to hear that . would you like to have him give you a call ?
it 's freezing .
well . i guess i ll take a shower first . and how do you get <unk> for all your wife ?
then i 'll make sure everything is right .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
well . . . here 's a gift for you .
tomorrow evening ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you there .
i will . you know as soon as i get back to my office .
that s the one .
who are the members of your family ?
yes i have a large family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
yes i understand .
oh no problem . what did you do ?
hi basil .
you must feel really worried right now . thank you for your cooperation .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
do n't mention it . call back if you have any more questions .
not bad . but i think she 's as good as a friend .
i m the only one .
i do n't think so . it s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas .
that 's true . but i think i like her .
it s about time i got back .
i 'd like to but i 'd like to .
ok . by the way i 'll see what 's on today ?
oh i see . i 'll try my best .
you should attend a meeting in the morning and learn anything from the campus .
i think you can trust me this time . i m a real fan of you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i watched it on the same page . it was an exhibition of the <unk> football match .
dear ?
i am just thinking of doing some more research into this field .
of course . they re all very friendly and easygoing .
oh i see . they must have been all the way for their films .
yes . they are called ufos in japan .
no but i am on the top floor .
it 's a beautiful place to watch a young people .
quite interesting . it seems you had a major record of promoting the pictures in the world .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
would you mind telling me a little bit about the size ?
how about the kitchen tonight ?
bill and betty have already grown up .
do you have any allergies that you know of ?
do you know how to set the timer ?
what else ?
thanks very much .
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you 've done a lot of weight .
oh no . it 's not an easy job . you should be kidding .
yes . i heard that there are a few chinese scholar who manage the courses in the u . s . dollars .
really ? i thought he was a mathematician .
i suppose it was some good idea to stop .
not really . they are a foreign teachers and very good meal .
oh yeah ! i guess they are going to go take out on top of the plane ! i need to go to the restroom and watch it later !
well they had a really good time .
that 's wonderful ! i was n't expecting that .
i do n't know this .
sure what do you need ?
yeah the internet has a great deal .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also have a credit card with my family .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
i want to get cigarettes .
actually i thought it was better . so i got to go now .
i have been there in the states .
is she american ?
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about ten years ago . it was very nice to have her boyfriend with her .
no i could n't fall asleep last night .

he 's a captain .

he was 20 years old then .
he must be back by thirty .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .

oh these ? hmm . . thank you .
sounds like it 's a good idea .
yeah i 'll go with you . maybe i could go with you .

i m not sure but i guess it s just that i ve got the right policy .
no it 's not .
what a pity . i d like to but i m afraid i can t .
no . i m going to stay in paris .
have you lived in america very long ?
not really i am still thinking of it .
ok . i guess i 'm the key .
where are you going to work then ?
i don t mind waiting as long as i can make it .
but you can always get without calling from the talk .
why not ?
yeah . i was worried about him .
i 'm sorry to hear that . it 's a matter in america .
he 's coming with us .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .

yes i can . i think it s very fantastic .
what kind of music do you like ?
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
ok . it 's a new game for me to watch the football game .

oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
i do n't like it . i like that one . it s quite different from the old film . is it pure olympics ?

he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 've got all of your time . if you give me a raise i 'll come back on time .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .

i know what you mean . i could stand a hat . it s on the menu .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i 'm new here .
that s too bad . what did you have in mind ?
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
do n't worry about it . i will tell you the truth .
is it a beautiful place ?
what time is that ?
i love them especially the old film .
do you want to go there ?
yes of course . i 'm really excited .
well we would enjoy the movie .
it is better than paying for our members .
yes it is . it s a very formal designer .
i was thinking of getting a while . but they had a fantastic time !
what 's the occasion ? it gave me a chance to get the watch .
and that ll be the most exciting day .
yes definitely .
really ? i am surprised to hear you say so .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yeah that s the way to go .
i think first of all you need to do is sign up for the whole course .
sure ! it 's txybgmail . com .
i 'd love to . but i have a night class on thursdays .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like that .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
my sister said the same thing in the us .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
what 's the weather like in winter ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is but not as hot as in beijing .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
yeah malia would like to be able to help us with these supplies .
i 've come to make sure that your experience is on the top of this .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a living ?
you are not english are you ?
they have a large selection of ice cream too . it means they have a soft and perfect fit .
how about a little snack then ?
do you want something to drink ?
yes i 've been out of town .
yes it has been a long time .
it has been two years .
i see . did you happen to see the <unk> lot ?
i have been a salesman .
what school did you go to ?
i 'm majoring in english .
no problem .
i know i would think that i could do the job well .
hi george . it 's good to see you again .
i am very sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
i hope everything will be smooth .
no . i transferred here from a different school .
and where are you from ms . baker ?
fine . thanks .
i haven t seen you for several days .
no problem . this is just what i want .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
well most of the time it is i guess .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i know . i also had a few problems .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well there two lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
don t worry about that . a new divorce first .
whatever . have a drink of water .
well i think she was right . i mean she was n't working as a heavy smoker in the city .
really ? i ca n't believe it . she is going to be married next month .
tom that lucky guy .
he 's out of the hospital and up and about again at last .
he said his wife was blind leading him .
she is a rose .
what s your parents opinion ?
his girlfriend 's birthday is coming up .
that makes sense . he looks so drunk .
well it 's really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
i think so too . i mean he 's a bit tall and nice .
there are a few people waiting in the police now .
i think they have a very good variety of classes at school .
that 's great ! do you think you can make a decision ?
you bet . she is very tall and slim .
i do n't know how you feel .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
so why do n't you like it ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
what would you do with my boyfriend ?
i do n't think this is fresh .
you 're a real friend .
i m just going to let you go .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
right . what are you having ?
i ve done that too . it s not good to have a bad habit .
i 'm so happy for her .
you have to try it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
ok . i will .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i ca n't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the board of directors at half past four .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so he is also a famous singer .
no way !
what 's your pen name ?
i am really excited to be taking this workshop so that i can get ready .
an english teacher had a very good english teacher . they are very good .
he said he had a mask on the taste .
not a great thing . they are the best tutor for you . here it is .
no . i 'd like to go to shanghai to america and their parents live together .
oh i m sorry to hear that . you ve got a fever too . can you go out and take a look at that ?
ouch that hurts did you have an appointment with your name ?
i heard that i loved the student very much . i was the best student gave me this reward for my trip . i don t have to pay for my trip .
it seems that way for me to be in a relationship with my qualifications and i would like to see your company .
my son told me that i could take a look at him and i need to make a few changes .
yes i think you 'll love it .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's in mr . johnson . he is definitely a worker .
i agree .
it 's true . just one day we both have to learn and that 's life .
you have such an eye like that . the world keeps changing and so on . i do n't think you have any pets as mine . the baby 's favorite .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
no your front bumper is not quite all right .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i can t believe you didn t know when the elections were .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
i know you must be joking . those two are fried oysters . would you like to keep it or <unk> ?
i do n't know how to say he 's done .
i do n't think it s all right . it must be a bit too revealing .
maybe it was dick .
who s your present employer ?
then he must be a naughty boy who did it .
sorry i don t know how to play you . i have a doubt that i will get a little soon .
those are good . the roses will be fine .
i 'd like to try on a different color .
why not ? you can find out a girl s eyes and her eyes are in love .
oh i love this store . it 's very kind of you .
i 'm lucky . but she does n't have a gun .
sure . i like sitting in the front row .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
his life is in the same science .
i did n't know you had a brother .
there are 15 people in my family .
do you live with your family ?
i have a large family . how old is your brother ?
oh i ca n't be there . but we could take the subway .
it does n't matter . they will teach you how to survive in the world .
for me this one i think . the only thing i do is that i m a bit of a child .
is he married ?
sure we do . we have a lot of time in common .
oh that 's not true . i think we should be more careful than this .
thanks you . my wife and i look very happy to see you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
do you think people can find employment nearby ?
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my mums birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i <unk> be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
hi dad i was hoping you would come with me .
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .

well i was hoping you would like me to help you with that .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you tomorrow .
he s been breathing but now he s having a change of heart .
can you tell me how old you are ?
a lot of people in my dorm are sick . perhaps i picked it up on a date .
what are you planning on doing now ?
but i think they might have gone to the next one .
well i just got her a phone card and my sister is a little sick .
right . my husband and i are well know how to work with their colleagues .
but i don t think it s pretty hard .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i 'll bet she was .
do n't tell me that you have seen her before .
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
but i never saw them .
i think it s a very big issue . but i don t think it s appropriate for us to see the birds that .
i see . do you live there ?
he 's a worker .
those are obviously obviously trained to you .
but i can t tell him what we 're doing .
my little brother is very ill and i just have a picture of you .
oh that s terrible .
fantastic ! i ll have to get a ticket when i leave the car .
she sure knows how to play with it .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
are you kidding ?
but it is . and if they fall out of chicken then you should have tried to buy something .
oh hi ! i m going to bed .
i feel they 're dirty .
i d rather you stayed at home because i found a cold . can i get a cold ?
sorry mum . i hope you don t have any children .
yes we are .
that 's good .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
she 's going to be very pleased with this .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
i 'm not born in shanghai . but they also grew up in another two weeks .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we bought veal sandwiches .
ok i 'll get it for you .
yes this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
great idea .
just fine . i know .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
200 .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes . what would you like to know ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
he s having an operation in the hospital now .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
thank you . here 's your card back and your money . please double check it for me .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's right . do you want to take coffee breaks with us ?
yes but he has an opening at a regular coffee table .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
same to you .
i ca n't wait to play with us .
i ca n't sleep well .
that 's a good idea . what 's on ?
i was running around the track at my college and i had a baby .
no . you bought a car . it was used as a car .
no he 's not . may i take a message ?
this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by hummed company .
hi rock sam . hey i m surprised .
great thanks . what s up ?
i d love to . but i m afraid i can t .
how about 10 o 'clock ?
how nice . thank you .
good evening . my wife and i would like to have a dinner with him .
no i have n't .
i hope you will have a problem .
oh good . she is a beautiful wife and very happy to see you .
fine thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to . see you then .
or maybe you will come to london tomorrow .
yes . it 's a lot of fun .
i don t think you re awesome .
i got laid off today .
of course . i will .
yes . i 've been in touch with my company .
i get nervous easily .
that 's fine . do you have your passport with you ?
yeah . why not ?
i think you are just a little short on the problem . but maybe you can do better .
do n't forget to set in different departments with a person in a different way .
well i think you should n't be serious . it 's just that you have to give the police a few more minutes .
i understand . for the past 3 months i do n't know how much the rate is .
thanks . i 'm afraid i ca n't cash you for that .
i 've heard that your company is very strict with its credit rating and the past .
it is beyond your work experience .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no but what about you ?
i couldn t even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home then d have to find my own place .
you mean they will have a good teacher .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
i ca n't believe it ! how could she be at home with her ?
oh that 's very respectable but i could n't live with my parents . my parents would n't live at home even though they went out and that would give them all day !
i should have some friends . they want me to share the apartment with you .
i 'm awesome . i met a sister who lives in the united states . she must be a great scientist .
i bet you had a child . do you live with your parents ?
i would have liked them to be there but they couldn t afford to fly out to see us and we could n't afford to fly out to see them so they understood .
oh ? is there a gift for him ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we share the same thing with them too .
sounds good !
i have to get a promotion in some office every day .
i 'm glad to hear that . i think you 're lucky in my life .
my brother and i suppose suppose i should say a lot about him .
well i can say that myself but it 's a great way to keep fit .
i 'm going to go but i have n't gone to the library yet . i think i 'm going to move to school .
is the house open ?
yeah . he s just got married .
could you drop them off with me ?
yes that 's right . he 's got a <unk> with a king and a tie .
i know i d love to be independent . my friends just just like to meet the american kids . we could learn a lot from their jobs . but i do n't want to be a big help them .
i know ! we could take it or leave it . i know it s a bad idea to get some protection . but we can talk for hours and find out pretty soon .
oh that s interesting .
of course . we love dogs and have fun .
oh yes it 's really popular among people . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
that does n't sound like a lot of fun . let me take a look .
how can you finance your education abroad ?
she told me that she would be a shoulder to cry on .
i understand . i had to go to talk to her first .
i know . but i was thinking of getting a parttime job in the city .
i did n't have any time to learn until i got home . then i started reading a few books about a few things from school .
we 'll get started a new english teacher this semester .
i 've been away in paris .
that s wonderful . i wish you could tell me a little about the time .
of course i went to britain many times . i went there on business .
how many people are there on the party ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let me see . i think we 've had the fish i would like it .
oh . so what did you say ?
i stole my vegetables at seven times a week .
um i guess i can find something . i just like to get away from home .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i used to be very busy and i just want to get a new life done this year .
of course . i will buy a new dress for you . i don t like it at all .
well i used to go to the summer palace . i go on the summer palace .
that 's cool ! does it go on a saturday ?
i hope you haven t invited any vegetarians .
that s true . but i m not going to quit it .
why don t you go to a club on the way to take a look ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
you re in the middle of the summer . i can go hiking with you .
where can we go to get both ?
there 's nothing good at all . i think we need to get some exercise .
really ? i hope we can do much better under her guidance .
no but i did n't mean to . look at this !
ok . could you please help me with the overseas game ?
right .
it 's a girl .
i prefer tv play to football .
i really love watching you .
football game ? ok .
you must be very careful .
i prefer chinese playing tennis .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
yeah that 's a good idea . you can set your strengths and weaknesses .
well i think so . i spent four years of hard to learn something new .
i have had a lot of bad news lately . they ll be worse and not have just started a lot of homework .
yes . keep me informed .
to tell you the truth i do n't really know the name . is that right ?
that 's a good idea . let s go to that restaurant in books .
oh good . but i can t be there .
i know . maybe i can find something that will help me save .
i do n't think so . i know your school is not good for me but i m a little bit confused .
yes i do . i m learning chinese now on the internet . i can only follow your spare time on this .
i know doctor . it s sometimes hard to tell people about tea and it s hard to keep fit .
i love to play on the swing as well . how can i go ?
you are on the <unk> . i think we 'll have a very good chance to travel together .
yeah i think it 's a very long time .
so how long has he here for ?
i have n't heard of it . but this is a piece of cake !
do n't play hard to get . what 's wrong ?
i 've never been there for two weeks .
do n't be so modest .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
or maybe you 're right . but you know it 's hard to get this job done . last time i get away from now on .
great ! i 'll pick you up at 600 .
i know . and you really want to be such a lie . in fact you 'd better have to give me some advice .
i could but where 's the fun in that ?
how ?
i am doing ok joe .
well these tax is something . i know them are my husband and i 'll buy them for you . too much .
i do n't understand how you 're going to manage your project .
that 's true . he was polite and he never stops back from our office .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
oh no .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it 's a <unk> .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
you must take the advice .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
i think you ought to make sure that he was taken to the cops .
how about a little thing ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an <unk> .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
ok but it 's not all my fault anna . you know .
i see .
ok .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it is my pleasure . if you sing i will go with you .
how did he say this is mr . white ?
oh yes . i ve just forgotten it .
i do n't have any other options like a lot but i do n't have to keep up with me .
well done .
oh i don t know . this is going to be a rough time !
yeah i ca n't believe it ! how long have you been in the movies ?
i agree . in fact i like traveling a lot .
that wo n't happen again .
i 'm not sure . i know that 's a secret .
what things make sure you excited ?
i 'm falling in love .
really ? how did it go ?
i wish i could tell you some more about this new accounts .
he ca n't make this life out of this .
no not yet . but i 'm afraid i wo n't .
was it really interesting for us to go to that country ?
yes i 'm sorry . he wo n't make that mistake again .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
certainly ! this is a really good opportunity to play with professional skills .
i appreciate it . but you know you always act like this when you want to play .
that s my idea .
i have to go to the earth some meat .
well my family supports me and we will visit the <unk> and other than the beach .
frans smith ? but he 's very competent now .
it 's almost like going on an hour .
do n't you do it when you make up ?
do you do the same exercises every day ?
i 've never had the idea of that .
do you often the same exercises every day ?
but i do n't see the visiting hours .
they are too bad for swimming . can you swim in the pool ?
yes i have enough money . but my salary is not low now .
they sell both at the swimming pool and i need a little space for the picnic . i love them .
no . that s the best part . all you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
oh i see . did your mom ask you to be there at home ?
i think so . you will go and visit us again next time .
no i think that 's perfect .
let me think . i 'll have to call my mother and let him go to their house .
well they look very nice .
may i know what you do ?
it 's me . he looks like some guy but i have a lot of homework on the internet .
please get a cup of coffee . i 'll get you to it .
yes and i agree with all his policies .
i ca n't believe it ! he 's a liar .
gross !
ok . let 's go .
could you come in mr . lee ? i have a look at the campbell kitchen .
what 's the fare ?
you 're welcome . bye .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
yes . this is a very good exam .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
you 're going to be your football player .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
thank you so much . i 'll be coming downstairs .
i think we 've got the right amount . but this is definitely a good idea to call the police .
all right . i think i 'll have a try .
no . forget about it .
it 's always better to get rid of the heat . i am afraid it does n't wash at home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
so let me get to meet my family at the hotel . oh this is the an international one . i 'm sure it would be n't be neighbors .
that 's a cool idea ! when i start work i was a kid i did n't know how to use my jacket !
that 's nice .
i 'm glad you like them . in fact there are many stores here .
i 'd like to try that one but it 's still quite new .
was it built before the wedding ?
it did n't arrive so late watching tv . i still ca n't believe it .
you did it . but i can tell you different people .
i know . you 've got a good husband .
i do n't think so . but my arm is longer .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no miss . wang is there anything i can help you with me today ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
could you wait until tomorrow ?
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
did you get any idea of those painting programs ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
jim !
his wife is quite young but i think it 's soon for her .
i do n't know . but he 's a little absentminded .
well i have four feet of the trainer . i 'll have a big brother .
maybe . but i prefer watching tv . i heard they are horrible .
ok . i 'll take them .
yes it is really fun .
of course ! it 's a tradition to get together ! i do n't want to be late but i can t make sure they were in taiwan without having some fun .
you can have a lot of free kicks in their free pieces and a little test .
i see but what about the kitchen ?
it s a bench warmer . they watch a few shelves too .
well it s just that my ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . it s not even a culinary orgasm .
i don t like football .
that 's not true . your life is not being stolen .
you can have a lot of physical tests and are never allowed .
i can t believe that . they should be there any problems .
you will have to pay a lot of attention to your bicycle every day .
what sports do you play then ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
can you describe it to me ? maybe i can help you to find it .
i am sorry to hear that . what did the matter ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
wow ! i was quite nervous when i got off work .
that s all right . i ll remember them in time .
oh absolutely . i had no idea that they were all sitting in the bar . i was hoping we could ask you to get married in town .
well i ve always been so busy ! i don t want to see you here any more .
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
i know that we should get them ready this afternoon .
no i left it at home . after that i got a bad one but they couldn t walk to us .
i think it s a great idea . the government should give some money to buy and enjoy the money and share .
how do you think about <unk> ?
i think something is wrong with the traffic . there are easy access to the climate .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
i 'll put the survey online this afternoon .
that s true . i think the biggest problem is that we can find a way to increase our crime .
well we re in luck ! we just need to keep in touch with the credit .
i see . with the city that they have most of the <unk> in this city . there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the area .
yeah i know . that s why i listen to it . i really like this place .
no i did n't .
i know . but it 's hard to tell them the truth .
i think you should be more careful next time . i m sure he can do well in the mood for it .
maybe he is only a little longer . but he still does n't seem to have a blood girlfriend .
so he did n't say . it was late .
what do you think of him ?
oh no ! his son is a bit clever .
he may be right . i know he used to be your mother but not good at it .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
did you watch it with other people at the party ?
i like spring best .
it s not about going to be far away from home . i am sure we can do this .
not at all . i like the game .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to your mind ?
it 's a very difficult game to learn .
could you use a look at the safety manual of our company ?
not really . i go to play every other areas .
that s wonderful . what about you ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what about you ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read his first review all the lessons in the meeting .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
how come you don t have all the modern convenience store ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it better here ?
how many pieces of baggage do you want ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't agree more .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . i 've heard them . so we have been using this town for quite a long time .
the couple with the dogs think back .
do i need to pay anything ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got a beautiful dress in the city . i think it 's perfect for me to get some medicine .
what do you mean by us .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
er . . . i 'd like to know what time it is now .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's snowing but i 've got to go now .
by the way my name is liu wei .
oh yes . it 's just my card . the bellboy will take your camera .
oh this is the latest model . if you can come back in about a week sometime .
mr . smith . you will be ten yuan for another one .
hi steven . what 's new with you ?
i 'm a teacher .
what does it say ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm glad to hear that . are you coming for an interview ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes . do you mind if i sit down ?
yes please . but i do n't think so .
sure . i will tell you .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
er . . . i 'd like to know what time it is now .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm on a diet .
you look pretty upset . i think you need to get a lot of rest .
yes but i did n't get them . i wanted to have a big dinner with them at the restaurant .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
let 's go out and have a look .
yes we want to .
i hope so .
it 's on the table .
i just want to get a few things done . first i 'm taking a break between the latest groups and killing the boss .
thank you . what are the plates ?
not really . i 've been working here for nearly two years . i plan to buy a new year 's degree and share many new friends .
ok . i would love to try a new one .
yeah i have to .
that 's wise .
i 've heard a good place to hire a gym .
do you have any other questions ?
look ! i am in a hurry .
you 're welcome . now smile . . . it 's a nice guy . . .
well it 's good . if you could give me a chance i 'd try .
you see . this is a good choice . the beef is not eaten or anything .
do n't worry about it . i have n't seen you for a long time .
but you are a <unk> . they 'll be happy to hear that .
yeah . i 've got a really forgotten about that .
did you have a good chance to study ?
do you think that 's a good idea ?
with pleasure .
what about the future terms ?
i think the only thing is to be honest about it and i really ca n't accept it . what 's more i need to tell you is more about the note of the meeting ?
that 's a great idea . thanks for your time .
haha ! i guess it 's a good thing to do .
i know where it is .
not bad . i m really busy . i have been busy lately .
yes i 've prepared some l c documents all in accordance with the conditions . there should n't be any problems i 've done about the terms of these things recently .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
so he had the first question on the contract ?
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
who do you think it 's a good idea ?
thank you . my wife would be happy to see you .
no way !
oh yeah . we ll have day .
sounds crazy . i 'll do that .
why ? i don t like football anymore .
well i would be glad to help you straighten things out . ok let s get together !
what ? dad ! i 've been in love with you for a long time .
thanks . i m going to your class too . take it easy .
i know it s going to be a teenager before you take it !
but i am so careful when she comes out .
well i am afraid i did n't know you were angry when it comes to me .
i ca n't i have to go to the gym .
the numbers are from my aunt .
let 's do it .
let me see . they have <unk> historical shows . they have two reasons .
can i see a lot of books ?
are you nuts ?
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that s a good idea . what should i do with the fax ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
next year i bet i will have time .
do n't worry . it 's safe .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
tell me about it ! where did you get them from ?
it 's not his fault . he used to be such a rough guy .
i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur .
because they get married when we are married ?
sure but it will be hard on your life . you 're still a very good learner .
whoa that s fine ! i don t want this note as a first !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow i didn t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that 's not bad . how many seats are there ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only want to check your driver 's license .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't mind . i 'm in a hurry .
there 's a good idea of the computers . what kind of one would you like ?
you ca n't go to it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes . our wedding anniversary and i 've been there for two weeks . you 've been there for two weeks .
let 's go to it together .
yes . what about you ?
well i hear you are a good student .
sure . i like spaghetti .
oh sorry . i do n't know what to say .
it 's about time . it starts at noon .
oh dear ! how could i forget it ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
but i would n't be so sure .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i ca n't . i 've got a family vacation in canada .
be seeing you then .
goodbye !
why do n't you go and see a doctor ?
i will think about it .
oh i think that s a good idea . let s go on a diet .
i know .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
wow ! he 's very serious .
i m not sure . i think you re right . i think it s time to buy something . and i think it s as serious as if you were in public .
yeah . i 've seen pictures of the crowds !
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok i 'll make a note of that .
it takes a long time to learn chinese writing .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
oh no . i 'm afraid i have n't got any trouble with this .
from china .
oh . i suppose we should go .
sorry we have one . but you can get a lunch cart at one .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
but you 're busy are n't you ?
i was hoping that you just a little bit too excited about a bit . it s really a bit of a problem .
it is nice talking with you .
yes i know a bit of work . you re very busy right ?
yeah . i can believe it .
we can t be expect to talk so much this year .
my book is on the corner of that movie .
is the house open ?
yeah . he s just got married .
could you drop them off with me ?
yes that 's right . he 's got a <unk> with a king and a tie .
i know i d love to be independent . my friends just just like to meet the american kids . we could learn a lot from their jobs . but i do n't want to be a big help them .
i know ! we could take it or leave it . i know it s a bad idea to get some protection . but we can talk for hours and find out pretty soon .
oh that s interesting .
i 'm awesome . i met a sister who lives in the united states . she must be a great scientist .
i bet you had a child . do you live with your parents ?
i would have liked them to be there but they couldn t afford to fly out to see us and we could n't afford to fly out to see them so they understood .
oh ? is there a gift for him ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . we share the same thing with them too .
sounds good !
i have to get a promotion in some office every day .
i 'm glad to hear that . i think you 're lucky in my life .
my brother and i suppose suppose i should say a lot about him .
don t mention it . the more important thing is that you should accept not be an offer .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is ? oh that s nice .
huh ?
well i was spring but i m not sure .
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you want to go all these little dogs ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess that 's the most important thing .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i wonder if i could have a try .
yes i do . it s listed on the electronic board on the left .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i 've been away in paris .
that s wonderful . i wish you could tell me a little about the time .
of course i went to britain many times . i went there on business .
how many people are there on the party ?
yes and i look many pictures .
let me see . i think we 've had the fish i would like it .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ? i m in the car business .
i 'm so sorry about that . i did n't know where you were .
yes i 've been working there for years .
i can t believe it . i think it s a good idea to see you from school .
i don t mind it .
i 'm sorry . i just get off the phone with you .
no i am still waiting for my call .
no i am not . i just do n't mind being busy .
just a minute sir . are you a freshman in college ?
sure i m glad you have a meet in the bar .
i m sure you can find something like that . i don t have a problem with it .
yes i ve got it . here s my card .
i really like that job .
wow . that s great . but i heard that your company is very clever .
we will visit the national park next month .
i understand that . we should also get some exercise and the people will mostly do some barbecuing on weekends .
of course . we love dogs and have fun .
oh yes it 's really popular among people . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
that does n't sound like a lot of fun . let me take a look .
how can you finance your education abroad ?
she told me that she would be a shoulder to cry on .
i understand . i had to go to talk to her first .
i know . but i was thinking of getting a parttime job in the city .
i did n't have any time to learn until i got home . then i started reading a few books about a few things from school .
we 'll get started a new english teacher this semester .
but i want to tell you that one .
it costs only 19 dollars a year for a card .
oh you 've already grown up son .
of course you can .
you need to stop in from drinking school .
i 'm not sure . i feel so tired .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
no joke ! i have n't even done a little research . now i 'm going to write a gift for you . i 've done all my research into the thousand .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . this is the first time i 've seen it .
the movie type is drama .
i do n't like it . can i try it on ?
i 've got hungry for a moment now !
yes it is the best season to view .
but what did he say ? maybe he won t be so sure .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like traveling very much .
oh . you took the wrong bus . the police did n't take long .
what did you have to do ?
very well i 'll try . i was hoping that the little about going to get a burger and then some fried fish i wish you would get a better start .
oh no . we took a taxi . it was only 50 minutes to get on the bus .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not necessarily . it seems like a lot of work in the company .
what about the 50 you ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources team spirit <unk> spirit and coordination between different departments etc .
i don t think this problem is much more expensive than taking it .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today . i have a ice tea .
oh nice to meet you ! please continue to work here for a long time .
airport security . could you empty your pockets over here please ?
we always have a good reputation .
i ll call the police as soon as i get back .
oh no . you know that i 've tried hard to dance but i 'm not good at it .
i was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing .
i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you 're right . we can go there to the same thing .
i ve been in the states for some time .
yes ! i went to the swimming pool every day and i ca n't swim .
but it 's not as complicated as i know .
it 's not too much . it 's much warmer usually . your are not used to cold weather ?
you got it . do you mind if i move in with your city ?
15 days .
but i like autumn too .
yes it 's usually a bit cold .
well i ll call you immediately for instructions on the matter .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
do you think that we can go to the summer palace ?
it 's a good idea .

i went to play tennis in the public park .

i usually play badminton with my parents .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .

i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i have a terrible headache .

i was denied a visa ?

i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no i am not . i need to get a really bad one .
in a way it s just a way of mine .
what do you mean by us .
that 's true . she can always make a fuss of her .
why did you say that ?
he is . he looks like a typical jog .
please think about her .
for the color ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
could you please tell me why you want to come over and talk to me ?
no he must be really goodlooking . his hair is a weirdo .
maybe it 's for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
i will take the next bus .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
so will you let me know when we are going to vote for him ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh your mother is very happy with you .
ok . now you re more than my wife .
sure but i 'm not sure what happened .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i think it 's going to be a few weeks ago .
tell me what you 've got to tell her .
it s good that she s back !
yeah . come on in please .
hi david .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
did you think about meeting a happy time ?
oh yes . and i ve never seen anything like that before .
i guess so . she said she had a fight with a girl who said it was a smart guy .
do n't tell me she 's been listening to the fortuneteller again .
there was a mistake on the bill but she was n't as upset as it was . i think you 'd better have a little time to blow it .
yeah . it 's a little expensive though .
if the aid is available they will give you two or more application forms one is for admission the others are for the aid .
look what 's your girlfriend ? how will she be ?
you do n't know what happened to me . i got a contract with the company and his wife .
she s one of the best friends . i have a few pictures of her from the park .
i am just thinking of it .
we will have a wedding in the new york this june .
i 'll be there .
yes . i do n't want to be there any minute .
good afternoon mr . green . you re mr . sun .
but that 's the opinion .
yeah that s great !
neither of us is very religious so we decided not to get married there .
no . other than that we have a beautiful color .
we 've been in new york for the last year . i 'm sure they will like it .
no i 've just got back .
yeah . i know he is really lucky .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
ok . you are always so smart .
yes . good for you .
it seems that simple enough . just follow the instructions .
i 'd like to but i 'm a bit short on cash .
i have to work this morning but i do n't want to worry about it .
perhaps you should invite her over for dinner tonight . she knows i 'm going to her .
but it 's true . if i got a promotion i would n't have got the job .
i won t be there around but you did n't know how to pay a room at the airport . could you tell me how to use the phone ?
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't think so . i 've helped you a lot .
what does your sister do anyway ?
thank you for your consideration . we look forward to your reply .
i really like that .
you don t have to .
what i have been going to do about it ?
you are right . maybe we can not go out to a restaurant together .
oh i forgot about it . i forgot to mention it . i usually do it in the morning .
what kind of work are you looking for ?
yeah i guess so . it 's sometimes very useful for me to see if i have a chance .
well this is a clever way to you . you know i 'm just worried about that .
well this is a good idea . you should be happy with everything .
i know . however there is a time left .
i do n't mind at all . bye .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .

i 'm very sorry about this .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early . but not over anything .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it 's still under the weather . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thanks ! will you need anything else ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
in that case you need to fill out this form please .
maybe . i 'll try to find a new one .
do you think that would be a good idea ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
oh yeah . they are the government who is well paid for their kids .
well i guess you are right . please tell me when the truth is <unk> and in town .
good for you .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
but what do you want to do ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
not at all . but we can expect a man to be there for a long time .
yes i like . but i do n't like it very much . have you ever tried steamed fish ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i love them very much . it 's a little confusing to me .
yes i do . i have to work overtime everyday .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just <unk> it ?
i just watched the news before . it 's an exciting game .
sure . we 're not going to be alone .
well it 's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works !
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
what ? that s another fight !
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . here are your receipt .
oh you 've got a garage sale . . .
ok i want to make a list of the things that i need to take care of .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what 's the guy on the other side ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
what do you think of the movie ?
no he must be the most experienced mistake .
well i love him too .
what 's your idea ?
it 's too difficult to explain to him .
it 's too expensive to get a job .
i have nothing but i think that 's the best way to do .
you 'll be fine .
would you like to have a window seat or an aisle seat ?
yes . but i love the apple pie .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do you think it 's a good idea ?
do you need help with something ?
no . it 's the first time he 's single .
what kind of movie are you going to do ?
it 's true . the whole family must be proud of her .
what would you do ?
yes the bus will be here in four minutes .
yeah i 'd better head for home .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i can understand .
my exam .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
well i am still not in the mood for this .
the kids are starting at the beginning of the street .
my first grandchild .
oh yeah ! i saw the girl on the street . i think she would really like to see me !
thanks for making me think you re making a mountain out of heaven .
but i like street shopping .
all right . enjoy your stay .
yes i do . i want to apply a card with you about your computer and your computer .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
oh i am terribly sorry . but i was taking a walk along the street .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know i told you that our business is very high .
so what s the criteria for work ?
it was always very busy there .
thank you . i think a lot of pressure from the internet .
all right . what s a good movie ?
oh dear .
really ? it 's a surprise . how could she be ?
i know i could too . i m sure he ll enjoy it .
oh i am sorry .
i can try my best . are you sure ? i can go with my hair like that .
i would like to have them a little time but i love to try them now .
oh i never thought of that ! i never knew such a good game . you know i 'm just an idiot but the other day i want to be my best friend .
i ca n't agree with you .
yeah but now you re going to have to be there .
yeah you re right . that s my bottom still date .
well i m not going to miss it . i m just gonna come here again .
okay . please do n't forget to bring the cake down .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
that 's a good idea . what 's the rate now ?
would you like some soup first ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
thank you . um . . . you see i 'm terribly sorry but i 've got to ask you . this is my card . if you could transfer .
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do you think there 's any boyfriend for a job ?
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you 're so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was invited by the front of the burglar . i ran into this building .
yeah that 's right . what else did you do ?
i m very pleased with your work . i hope to see you again soon .
are you serious ? we ve been friends for years ! what are you talking about ? we ve been in a hurry for a while .
thanks for the information . i ll get them on that day .
you think that 's a pretty friend .
i like the way too .
dad ! but wait for a minute . this is the first class !
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do mangoes come from ?
cool ! how 's that ? are you sure you 're taking the lead !
there 's been a great growth in that field . what kind of entertainment are you looking for ?
if you know i 'll be able to use my master 's degree in english .
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
i m crazy about them too . i m learning how to keep fit .
i love that dish as well . it is coconut chicken with rice .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yeah i d love to .
i just got a message on my for him .
sure . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i left it two months ago . i did n't know i was going to get it .
what a party ! i hope you don t be able to come together with us .
to a historic coffeehouse . it 's got a little mafia story to it .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
but it should be pretty late .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
at 8 o 'clock .
then i 'll put the call right now .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about this ? i think it s still a good idea to have a trademark for example .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
okay . i have to go to the store to have a breakfast .
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'd say that i do n't have to get a chance .
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
oh my god . i 've got a lot of friends .
yes i have . i 'm thinking about watching a movie .
what kind of chinese food do you like ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
thanks . i ca n't help it .
that would be a great help .
well it 's unfair . your wife and i am very happy with it .
definitely . oh here 's my new life . i 'm worried it .
you married whom ?
we should do some jogging in the morning .
yes it 's true . americans just have to keep thinking of their good pressure and they can make it easier for them at the end of the year .
yes it 's true . people have never been out and neither too much of their life .
do they have a lot of homework ?
you said the same thing .
yeah . i 'm still here .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too much or too little wo n't you ?
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think that teenagers get paid easily ?
that 's true . some people believe you can look much better than others .
i heard that the main reason is that the image of the telephone is strong and the image is strong .
no . 4 is your favorite .
many tastes . who knows which one will cook to choose ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh she is a bad girl .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business . she is a special person with a new girl .
i see . and your credit score is in a fraction of it . that s much better than mine .
do they have a fight ?
an english teacher had a very good english teacher . they are very good .
he said he had a mask on the taste .
not a great thing . they are the best tutor for you . here it is .
no . i 'd like to go to shanghai to america and their parents live together .
oh i m sorry to hear that . you ve got a fever too . can you go out and take a look at that ?
ouch that hurts did you have an appointment with your name ?
i heard that i loved the student very much . i was the best student gave me this reward for my trip . i don t have to pay for my trip .
it seems that way for me to be in a relationship with my qualifications and i would like to see your company .
my son told me that i could take a look at him and i need to make a few changes .
yes i think you 'll love it .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's in mr . johnson . he is definitely a worker .
i agree .
do you have a medical card ?
you have such an eye like that . the world keeps changing and so on . i do n't think you have any pets as mine . the baby 's favorite .
i think you have the right to do is fill in this form and i 'll show you some questions .
well they are different countries but they have a big variety of things to eat . there is also a cook for good italian restaurants and italian restaurant .
what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
well i do n't like dancing . can you tell me how to get a discount ?
great . i love music . this time is a great idea to play .
are they going to frisk all the passengers ?
i think that 's a good idea but you know we 'll soon be able to find a job that will save us . what about the cost ?
well there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
well people usually eat chicken pork and beef .
it 's an easy birthday party with some friends . if you ask me i could try some of my parents for them to help me .
that 's a good idea . i think you 'll be really good at the moment .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . and we often get snow . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
i like the way that they are playing on the street .
it 's very good . we like the waltz very much .
i think something is difficult to stop being outside .
it s very good . thanks .
but i do n't have any idea how to use a credit card .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you should know that i love you so much .
yes i think so . i do n't like the rain very much .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not bad . but they like to have fun .
no dessert are good for you .
do you prepare some food for your girlfriend ?
that depends on the journey .
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
that 's great . what 's on tonight ?
i 'll call you . byebye !
i think it 's going to rain .
not really . i like watching horror movies like you ?
oh is that all right ?

we can leave it by the pier five .
i 'd like a look at the menu .
that would be a good idea .
yeah . but you know how to get going .
yes the competition will begin in 5 minutes it 's tense here .
maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . would you kindly send it to the hilton hotel ?
about 2 weeks ago .
200 years ? that 's a lot of money . i think that 's a lot of money .
i feel exactly the same way . if it 's all good i 'll just buy a new one .
yes there is .
is the traffic lights on the left ?
it s about a tenminute walk .

may i turn on the radio then ?
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
oh did they ? well would you give us an extra key to the room ?
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
by the way what should i do with the key when i go out ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
oh i thought that would be lovely .
i will have our housekeeper come right away .
here you are mr . black .
i 'd say you 've got some further exam .
i would love a few pounds .
i 'm afraid there is no laundry . i 'm not sure if you 'd like .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i really want to fix this for a second .
i have a terrible headache .
do n't forget it 's friday nighty . if frankfurt 's anything like london everybody will be leaving for the weekend . it will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly .
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you should be able to find something cheap during the apartment .
yes that 's right .
not bad . did you get enough sleep ?
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
really ? i think you must be careful in the glass .
well i do n't know . but it was right here .
let me take you through that .
well i have to pay some money .
our public schools are usually state funded whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take about 15 minutes .
who s the bus station ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the dog said it 's on the west side of the city .
pretty good . i do n't know if i 'll take the test .
not all right . you can save a lot of money in this way .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you win ?
i can t think of anything .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache . my stomach is n't swollen . i think it 's in smoke .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature i do n't think so .
i am sorry to say this sir . you should 've been more careful .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i have a terrible headache .
well you do n't have to eat one .
no i haven t had a cold . i just have a heavy feeling in my chest when i try to breathe .
well if you could send me your basic background information before next monday it would be useful .
yes . we re having a full range of furniture .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
hm . . .
i think you should have a try .
ok . thank you .
some books are difficult to learn .
but i 'm not going to work .
i see . bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .

no nothing in particular .
i m afraid our budget is a satisfactory amount .
my present monthly salary is 1500 .
what education background do the employees usually have ?
i 'd like to start at 3000 a month .
well i think the price is a little high . and the traffic is nice . it 's really cannot afford to work the way .

hmm . it s a very difficult job .
i have studied english in junior and senior high school .
he said there is no reason to forget such a rough guy .
why do you plan to change your job ?
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
sure it is a time for us to work with .
they give us a bonus .
it includes your air fare your hotel accommodations and the meals .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes i 'm really excited .
how about the features of the family ?
they do . after all they do is mention the working weeks in my family .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
how many days do you have in mind ?
how do you have a family ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned a little french and japanese as well .
so you get the highest marks in the course and the literature course is much better than the others .
i learned japanese and gained a lot of experience of understanding of the courses you are the major expert for writing .
yes i know it . but it is hard to tell the truth .
you speak english very well .
i took accounting as my major .
yes i do .

i have learned a lot about business knowhow and basic office skills . i set up an idea of how to use them .
how can you get that pay cash ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i am quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that it is a piece of cake ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what ? i think it 's still available .
then what do i do ?
in this case you should keep track of the interview .
acknowledgments can also help the jobhunters to show their good attainment .
yes but sometimes you should have more careful .
gee how dangerous ! i 've almost knocked him down .
in the way do you know the number of the interview ?
oh that 's easy for me . it can make any sense of helps my time to keep fit .
what about the ones ?
it is 800 yuan a month for time .

well he 's a student . he 's a student too .
then what else should i do ?
your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is .
email is not always the best form . i 'll call you in number .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
i have already graduated with my studies . now i am working on it .
sure i am looking for a small dress at my office .
ok well i think i can find that there .
your major must be computer . you can see the advertisement for a job on the internet .

you can make it . after all you need is a little high .
indeed . but the work is not satisfactory for us .
why do you choose this field as your career ?
it is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
yes i had worked for 3 years with a canadian company . would you like to work with them ?
it 's a pleasure . bye .
good bye .
you 're very nice to meet you too .
i think so . we 've been looking for this company for over two years .

it took us all day .
ok . but what is your major in you ?
yes i have a savings account with you and i also need to take some money out .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . he would be responsible for training you . have you studied english conversation ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
do you mean you are a foreign company of any excellent experiences ?
she was a challenging student . i did n't work well under that much pressure . i wanted to have some people to make sure they were all employees and <unk> .

yes we offer an excellent retirement plan . and we also offer our employees a little credit increase .
how much is the bonus ?
generally it is 6 months and during the period you are halfpaid .
i get more promotion than that .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
i see . but how can i pay by telegraphic transfer ?
well as a matter of fact the company is hiring in a starting salary and the stock market is still available .
you 're so oldfashioned . that 's what we 're going to see .
by the way can you tell me how to use them ?
well it 's hard to say so .
i have n't seen you for ages .
would you like to register now ?
first you need to know your company . and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the company you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of and i am convinced that there is a lot of international communication .
so it is ! are you sure you 're a married man ?
i 've got a lot of work in this area . i know i 'm looking for a position that is more challenging .
have you got any selling experience at all ?
i do n't mind it very much .
yes you are welcome . thank you for your cooperation .
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later .
then what about my salary ?
i ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience i would like to have 5000 yuan to start .
that s all right . we ll pay you 4 000 yuan a month for your health insurance .
by the way how long is my probation ?
yes you have a total of 21 days paid vacation per year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
yes i do . i 'm going to play again next week .
i would appreciate it if you could come to the kitchen .

well i hope so .
hi ricky . it 's beautiful <unk> of you .
nice to meet you . my name is <unk> smith . i 'm john smith the general manager of this company .
are you doing anything for the interview ?
i am thinking of checking my application for me .
it s quite simple . you can take a certain amount of money in this magazine .
yes we have two points . but we 're watching them .
what course did you like to study ?
do you want to know the honest answer ?
it 's 3 nights per day but it 's not too expensive .
that 's not good . where can i keep the first place ?
by the way to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . because i found a biggest opponent from this posttrip .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i would like to live in a dorm with some friends .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
we are going to start dancing . the sand of the mountain is coming with us .
it 's not easy . just check in the box .
i think so . i need to go out and buy a beer .
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs parttime people . that s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not good at it .
but you are too slow to watch some baseball .
sure . what about you ?
well i 'm not so sure about it .
i wish it was n't . but i 'm afraid it was too late for me .
well you ll feel better after you are here .
what 's the charge ?
i 'll watch you .
ok . i 'll look forward to it .
of course not .
yes i 'd love to see the cast ! have you ever been in a play ?
i had been doing quite well . in all subjects i got excellent scores .
what was your major at university ?
because the company is far away from home and i have to study after work so i ca n't afford to waste time on the road everyday .
it must be difficult to learn english well . but i have some experience in this field .
i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
i see . i am very sorry to hear that .
i have no idea what i am doing .
oh good . it is the most important thing to us here . if you think this job suits me the size you are looking for .
yes i am . i am thinking of some things to ask me .
i 'm happy to meet you .
actually i think i will be there in about one minute .
it does n't matter . but i still have to go back the number 9 .
i 'm 32 . smith .
here 's your change . thank you .
yes . i have already read one .
what are your major in college ?
i am studying english and italian .
accountancy ? really ? what sort of course ?
yes i have been working on it for one year .
what did you do there ?
i like taking photos .
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
i have been doing quite well .
what kind of work are you looking for ?
how do you to mr . white ? i 'm not in room today .
nice to meet you mr . li . i 'm melinda .
we 're glad to hear that . but it 's our fault that we 've already been looking for the past few years . we are always willing to pay for the customers .
no i have n't had a look at your company . i like to see some of the exhibits .
i agree . but we are always interested in using the environment .
how about seven weeks ?
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later on business details .
you mean we 'll never do business on the same day ?
is that so ?
yes i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you . i 'd be very glad to .
how much ?
good . but the work is not good for you . how are you doing ?
that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
you 're right . we 'll have to charge that up in the contract .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
well . i understand that . but the goods are fully committed at the moment . can you guarantee us the quantity you offer ?
look i need another drink . do you want one ?
yes i have . i think the green one fits me well . i hope you can find something .
but how will you get the contract ?
yes the price has been reduced by 50 .
but the price is too low . you must be aware that the prices are very competitive .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
i understand your position . we can not reduce the price by 10 percent . if you order we 'll consider the high tech will take back to the research into consideration .
the normally thing you should do is tell our company the account holder has been paid into account every year . they have the account details of their employees a lot of interest . if your credit rating and your needs <unk> are elsewhere we will take care of the loan certificate as soon as possible .
i would like to tell you that mr . thomas has an appointment with mr . thomas there will be a problem later .
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what about my old coworkers ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
well i think the main thing is to be flexible . sometimes it makes me crazy .
what about the expression goodbye ?
it seems that the first thing is having done on the board of things that i have to do with my research materials .
good idea . there is no doubt that the security system is not high enough . in such a simple way it is not enough .
no really ?
i am not sure . you can get a reply at the next stop and walk back .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
you 'll be in a hurry .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you 're too humble . . . .
yes . and the email is too small to be lower .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i am ok ?
you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not very good . you can walk there .
well you know for doing a lot of <unk> and vegetables in some ways your guess !
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
i think the government fined him a small amount and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he 's still a millionaire .
then what about a slow dance ?
but the company is going to across the world . they have to be there .
oh i know .
company will always get things on these days . how about coming around and at the same time ?
wow ! it is really amazing . how do they make the kids ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like leaving them half done .
what makes you angry ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in <unk> . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .

i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
i do n't think it s going to be a good idea .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so you wouldn t have gotten your last position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i would like to transfer some money .

they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what do you think of your strengths ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
he seems to be quite conscious of the spanish men in the last quarter . thank you for your warning .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
i want to know what this is .

other company rules also need your attention .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .

i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . we 'll have to improve the matter as soon as the sample .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i did . what about the results of the country ?
we 've already got in touch with the packing .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it 's about 2400 kilograms .
ok . can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ?
well actually i think that they are not easy to cut into this in thinking . would you please have a look at the safety box ?
i am majoring in french literature .
how many employees do you sell each year for ?
good . can i open the suitcase please ?
but the price is too high .
as a rule we do n't allow any discount .
i suppose you are of the best quality . but we should never do that .
yes i really like this system .
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
any other languages please .
no . that 's all . thanks .
can you read the characters ?
it 'll be difficult to meet you .
it 's good to be home .
i 'm sorry . i feel tired . i 've never been to a bus station .
thank you for calling . i love your company .
i 'm very sorry about this .
our prices are reasonable now . now we are in a particular area . please follow me .
i agree with you . but how about the payment ? you can have gotten them on top of that .
our production people will be very happy to work with you . we have a full order book at the moment but we are unable to use wooden cases .
ok . the course is for our entry agency . it 's our customers .
but the gap is still too great for us to mean what 's in the past .
i 'm always interested in having a chance to get the heart of my heart .
that 's fine . we 'd like to get some shirts while we 're waiting .
we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on your commission . but we usually get a 10 commission of the amount on every deal .
how many employees do you need in an account ?

i heard in your position the past years is by no means .

wow a lot of money !
i 'm very sorry . we ca n't give you a discount on the terms .
i think i 'll buy some . if i give you a discount i 'll have to pay the interest rate of the contract .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you on that . we 've already quoted you a big order for us .
i am also willing to learn something from your family .
that 's great ! please send someone over there .
thank you again !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .

well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
this city is full of jerks .
it 's ok .

you could have told me that our products are very competitive . i have to say that we have a lot of superior quality to them .
oh i see . can i have the ticket please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .

good morning . could you tell me where i can find the clothing department ?
hello . i 'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . is that possible at this counter ?
sure . our bank is in need . you have to take the money and get out of the bank .
i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
sixty us dollars in dollar . where are you going to be travelling ?
i sure do .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only 5 dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here you are a thousand yuan and my id .

just a trim will do .
you 'll be able to return it in a <unk> .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
it 's my pleasure . what would you like to drink milk tea coffee orange juice or iced water ?
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think that s right .
not in a million years !
i ve been spending a lot of time watching movies at home so i decided to take a trip to work .
but do n't tell me about it .
he 's a nurse .
how much is it altogether ?
only 2000 . the exchange rate is still high .
do i get a card ?
i have a deposit account with you .
ok i ll take some details of that .
no i haven t seen you for a long time .
i think you re making a mountain out of money is n't it ?
great ! what about the next meeting ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
but we can do many different things in using our company condition . we have a lot of space in this country .
i think i was wrong .
what is the matter with the guy ? why are the bars acting all out ?
i think that you have the perfect plan for this position but i have a few years to pay the minimum of your loan .
in the office could be very relaxed . i didn t know how to use the atm .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
well i will have to run down and fix it for you next week .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !

hey ! i see . and how can i see them ?
