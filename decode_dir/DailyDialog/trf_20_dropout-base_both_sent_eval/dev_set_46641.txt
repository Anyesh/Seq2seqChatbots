but i do n't think it 's a good idea . you can ride the car for the air to the air .
great . how much is it ?
well it depends on how you want to travel .
no . i do n't think that 's the best way to lower the price .
it 's my pleasure . what are you going to do ?
ok . that is no problem .
i 'm glad you let me know .
let me get the check . you could get me a 20 percent discount .
sorry but my car is having problems .

thank you . have a nice day .
i am sorry but i would like to help you with the 10th .
oh yeah . i remember now .
yes . if you want to ask me .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i had to blow my nose .
no thanks . i need to change .
all right . i 'm finished .
hi .
well i can t keep you waiting . let me get you something to eat .
i m sorry . mr . smith is out of order .

i think the guarantee is the warranty .
i was hoping that the house could be a little more expensive .
i m sorry . i can t do that . it s my fault .
great . i will take it .
yes there is . and what kind of room do you want ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
no that 's all i can do .
i 'm sure you had a good journey .
you have to maintain a minimum balance of 100 .
ok . i will apply for it .
ok . i see . what kind of music do you like ?
i had to blow my nose .
no thanks . i need to change .
well that 's just a few minutes walk to my office come around and see me now .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
hurry up . the bus will take about 20 minutes and you 'll be able to get there at six thirty .
you 're welcome . this is my duty . anything else ?
sure . it 's just a bit .
can you make my hair short ?
well . do you like this one ? it 's a bit expensive but it 's a bit pricey .
the color i use now is natural .
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in the sea .
how about this one ? it 's the latest fashion .

all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
not bad . it 's a bit tight .
i would recommend it would be very expensive .
i 'm sure you will like it .
i 'm afraid not . the large dress is too small for me . it 's too plain on its own .
maybe by the way can you have a try ?
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
i m afraid we re not allowed any more .
got it . to whom should i report ?
yes . and you need to know what the matter is .
what are you talking about ?
what 's the difference between having a band and a regular price ?
i understand .
yeah i think it is easy to find . anyway the problem is that you are a girl .
what if i check my email addresses ?
excuse me ?
sure . and what kind of camera do you want ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
yes . if you like . they are all available now you can take a picture of me .
they do n't fit you right . the clothes are very fashionable .

yes i have i tried once when i visited your country last year i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
i think i will .
i think that is really a piece of cake .
i get the shopping cart . do n't get out of this .
get the jam and get some milk . i 'll take this up with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with .
just get the basics . perhaps you can get the hell out of here . this is a little smaller . i 'll go with these two .
what else are you planning on ?
is that a good idea ?
yes . i am .
i can do it .

my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
it 's hard to say . the kids are very friendly and loud . you should try to ride a car that goes on the street too .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's why i usually choose chinese women usually do n't like that .

oh yes . what 's that ?
it is ok with me .
i know i know . i mean it 's hard to believe . but here are some leaflets .

look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .

it 's my pleasure . if you just want a cup of tea coffee you 'll receive a refund .
you 're a good idea .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly .

it 's hard to say . the green dress is soft and comfortable .
well i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities we 've got to be extra careful . otherwise if the things we do n't want to see happened we would be interested in taking about them .

yes you 'd better take a hot shower .
well i like hot food too .
we need a lot of things .
would you like to have a drink ?
well . i recommend this medicine . it 's very same as it is . it 's very similar to people and make a list of all the things you want .
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . it takes us almost 1 hour to get to school .
i am happy to have a chance to use english . and also i d like to have a cup of tea .
ok we can take a taxi .
that s the traffic bad .
you mean the traffic bad ?
yes . there are many people here .
we are now running late .
oh there 's one at the end of the world . let me see what else there are .
yes let s get something to drink . i think i ll go dancing .
i want to get a pie .
no thanks . i 'm full .
nobody told you what happened ?
i do n't think so . i just want to get some food done .
i see . i ll get you another one . i m afraid not george . he s going in the house soon .
oh i see .
are you nuts ? what would it be ?
i think something must be done .
we can t .
what were you thinking about getting ?
do you know where you 're going to find your living room ?
because i m a newspaper columnist for the newspaper . i have a living in the library .
that s a good idea . thank you .
ok . there is no doubt that many people have chosen that day .
i see . the flight number is cz353 . it departs at 1710 and arrives at 45 .
i should be surprised to hear that .
it s a bit . can i buy the new bicycle ?
i think it s the best way to go .
yes sir where to ?
please take me to this address .
is it a long run to the station ?
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
that 's good . see you then .
that 's fine . is there a subway station near enough ?
i 'll take care of it .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
only a little .
oh i see .
thank you . welcome to our hotel again .
yes and i have an appointment with a credit card .
yes sir where are you going ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
well i can t think of any airline here . but there is a flight available on the sixth floor .
come on mary . i know you 'll be a good man .
it depends on how you want to travel .
here 's ten .
it 's a private garden .
you are going to be able to take a taxi ?
that is a deal .
ok . i am putting you down for 9
thank you very much . i hope i can make a good impression on my own .
hello angela it 's dan .
sure . take your measurements .
thank you . your order will be ready seven days from now .
yes i am . i really do n't know anyone .
can i have my 200 please ?
sure . i d be happy to . we are always in a different place .
ok . what about next time ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just one of those things .
ok . thank you .
i 'm sorry but this one is on the right side of the room .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time does it start ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
it 's a little high .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if you do it it it one would be very expensive .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
i prefer to go to work during the day and sometimes i go on to the summer palace .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
maybe . . . we can not give him another call . i am sure if he will return . .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven !
hi linda . i want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening .
it 's txybgmail . com .
very well thank you . i m meeting him at the airport tomorrow morning .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well if you get the promotion what will your new title be ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
you are welcome . but this is my first time to work in .
what do i need to make a appointment ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
it has n't been working the past few days .
i will be there .
she 's handsome but i think i 'm getting along with her .
but what does she think about her as a boss ?
yeah . the food was excellent but it 's already crowded .
well that might be a little too rude . did you tell him about it ?
what 's on your mind ?
i m sorry sir . we can t accept reservations for next friday morning . would you like to have lunch with us on saturday ?
well how long does it take to get there ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
here s the receipt . what size are you looking for ?
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i am afraid you will have to wait for the next two weeks .
when i put it in the front of you .
wow ! this is a good opportunity to see if i can ! where are we going ?
when is the gas station ?
great ! i m gonna get a dozen !
well . . . i used to go to the mall but then we can go to a <unk> ball . . .
what 's so cool !
i know . if you do n't drive you will have to wait for a few minutes .
yes . could you tell me how to use the atm for a transfer ?
you have a big fan of computer !
i d like to have a try . i think i have a good one . it s a very good idea .
and you can t have a bird <unk> ?
so you must be interested in photography then .
i m not sure if i can but i ll be back in a few minutes .
thank you . do you have any other questions ?
oh i see . you have a good one .
it does n't matter . here is the money .
i d like to buy an inexpensive camera .
uh where do you go ?
i don t want to buy that one . i d like to have the same logo as the atm is due .
what 's it like ?
no . i 've actually been wearing my jacket .
well maybe we should have a furniture store .
thanks . i think we ll be better off if we are in a hospital .
i 'm sorry . i 've already been out of this town . i might like to see some other solutions .
you 're welcome !
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
the chicken breasts are 4 . 05 a pound .
ok .
no that 's all . thanks .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
what do you think of the traffic today ?
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
do you like biscuits ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk .
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
i see . what do you mean ?
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
now you know what i think of this !
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
that 's very nice of you . thank you for your help .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
i 'm ask for a pizza please .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes of free groups of free groups each month a connection with a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free ! that are really serious !
are you serious ? i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had an appointment with a finance department meeting this morning .
i m sorry to hear that . we ll just cancel it and see how it is .

i can t wait to see the kitchen . . . . i guess it goes on the 17th .
oh come on . i m sorry to hear that . would you like to come to a coffee table ?

i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
do you have a size 8 ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you 'll have to wait for a while . here 's the money .
that 's true . i love the living room especially the summer .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .

maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .

yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i like indian food as well . i usually taste chinese dishes .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i do n't think i can . i have some good local specialties .
yeah it 's good and it 's good to know . my wife likes cooking but no one needs me to try some things . it takes me to find the best way to shop that is n't too expensive .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
oh do you like working in a particular brand ?
maybe a little too .
i 'm sorry . all the fitting room are taken . may i take a look at your black leather belt ?

i do n't think you can make it . why do n't you have a pc ?
what ? are you serious ?
i do n't think this is fresh .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh yes i 'm from taiwan .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i know . but i 'm not sure federal express picks up free .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
i can get you some coffee .

i 'm afraid i do n't think so . i 'll try to find the new one .
i 'm glad you could help . in what way can i do for you ?

i got on the wrong bus .
oh susie . didn t i tell you over and over again that you wouldn t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ?
no i don t . i think i m a very good driver .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i have n't .

hi lily .
i just got back from my sister .
really ? that 's great !
i 'm not sure yet .
of course not i am sorry i did n't think it would be so nice of you to come .
no i m not . i accept the moment .
you like the food ?
that depends on the topic the teacher .
yes i think so .
how about taking the dog for a walk ?
can you bring it to me ? i am not sure what you like to do .
can you help me move out ?
i saw someone walking like you but i 'm not sure how i 'd ever seen him .
how are you going to be so sure ?
i d like to but i m not sure .
i know that 's the problem . it 's a good thing .
it 's only a couple of years old . and you can do what they 're talking about ?
sure no problem . now what do you want me to do ?
but anyway who ?
i told you not to forget to bring the letter .
what did you want to know ?
i m afraid i can t . i ve got a parttime job too .
my father wants to go to the movies .
you seem to realize that we have to visit our game .
i got it . and are these two things that we hardly know ?
how about oil or spray ?
i just opened my own business not long ago .
yes we are sorry for the delay .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
you know !
it means that we have to cancel the reservation .
i agree with you . and i have done a lot of work in the company .
i think i want to try a new style .
i promise you do n't have to call me again .
i have been studying hard all day .
i know what you mean . i thought you were only doing what you would do .
yes . i find my heart is now rising
can i have my 200 please ?
next monday .
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for me .
what other foreign languages do you like best ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just a twoseater you know .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i do n't .
maybe i should call the police if you want .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i have . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
how much is it all together ?
what do you need ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
it 's a good idea to think about it .
i 'm in a hurry . how long will it take ?
oh i 'm so sorry . i know you 're right . but we need some more space for the environment .
i hope i can get a good idea of what i think .
i 'm doing really well .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
my class is in the c and i 'll go to the us .
i do n't know . it 's a tradition to ask the old people in the future .
we have a great apartment .
you 're right . we 'll get some exercise .
how about cash ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you were made up . how about a drink tonight ?
it 's a private garden .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know that .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
that 's a good idea . but you should go to the right school to visit the <unk> .
i think you can read english well . i can also speak to english fluently but i wonder if you are fluently .
yes i know .
oh i see .
what do you suggest i do ?
i will tell you where i am going to find my friend .

yes . we can also take a couple of sandwiches and also .

i hope you 'll do better in the final .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
i took a parttime job last year .
you speak english very well .
i 'm not a dancer . i do n't mind being able to take any topic as long as i have a parttime job .
i 'll give you a special shortly .

it 's convenient .
i know . i just worked on my english .

it seems that it may be a bit difficult . but i know they will change .
great . then i 'll think about it .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
i feel the same way .
i had no idea that it was n't my fault .
i 'm sorry . i did n't realize it .
yes but you should have told me before .
i know . i didn t realize that .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? that 's wonderful !
you do ?
sounds interesting .
i think that he ran a red light but not in the cold .
i wonder how much it is .
i 'm afraid what 's wrong ?
you must have seen her around ?
i said it 's a lovely day . why do n't we go for a walk ?
it does n't matter .
i got it from macy 's .
what do you think about it ?
why ? what happened ?
oh this pair fits me well . i 'll take this one .
yes it seems made to measure .
i know it 's a pity that i can t wait to hear it .
what is the price ?
okay . but i want to finish this report first .
can you introduce him to me ?
she is a young man !
don t you think you would miss having other people around ?
i got to be back from the spring festival . i was so tired all the news and the news on saturday of saturday . i heard that the weather forecast are coming to pick up a new leaf .
i hope that you have a good journey .
i was a teacher .
i have to file a report at the police station .
a lot of people like that . i 've put on my notice that i 'm not sure of the same guy .
hi . i 'm nancy . nice to meet you .
she 's a friend of my boss .
that 's a good idea . do you want to know something about the spanish course ?
she 's very nice .
ok i 'll try to catch her later .
i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy that she did n't make this decision .
her name is david white .
a lot of people like that .
yes she 's in a meeting with her .
oh my god ! i 'm just going to call you back .
i guess it is not your fault .
oh i hope you 're right . i 'll tell him you 're always so busy .
what 's it like lady ? oh what 's it look like lady ?
would you mind taking a few days ?
sorry i did n't realize it . i did n't know it . but this is my last time .
then i 'd like to have some fresh vegetables and chicken while you have hot chocolate .
maybe . but she did n't say i did n't know what to do .
we 'll play the cd loud is that all right ?
that 's right . i thought this was a nice opportunity to watch a movie and sit on the bed for a while .
that 's right . i 'm pretty busy . how about meeting in my office ?
they do n't usually make their fuss . they are the ones here .
oh it 's jack . excuse me .
yeah . a friend of mine took me to this one . he owns a digital one .
poor guy !
i know .
what 's he like ?
yes . he 's in the office and there 's no problem with the future .
they were supposed to do that but they were not very good and they did it .
what a bummer ! i guess you 're going to wear this evening ?
yes but how can i get a phone call ?
maybe . i do n't know .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . i 'm sure you 'll be able to keep it .
listen john . . . . well i think you 're going to like him .
it 's not just that . the goods are in the flyer with the shortly .
it 's nothing . it 's just that we do n't have a headache and it 's lucky too . i had to stay in the hotel for a while .
i 've got it . i 'm so sorry to hear that . you 're found out she was going to be around and you did n't know that i 've been missing out .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . you 're such a good catch !
there 's a fire in there . what happened ?
yes he was . i brought him a lot of initiative to get the ball .
where 's new to meet ?
if you do n't mind they 'll take care of it .
here you go . i 'm going to have to give your a credit card .
let me know if i can do anything for you .
please wake me up at 6 am .
we all know that .
no that 's the only thing we do .
that sounds pretty good .
what ? where does he go ?
just a minute . i 'm supposed to the mall to pick up my ticket . can you come ?
a little bit but i 'll have to ask for a while .
thank you . i have to prepare a supper for the barbecue .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
yes but i went to the store and bought it .
here are some nice brown hats . try this hat on .
i 'd like to .
oh my mom and i 'll be back soon . i 'm sure i 'll be back in a minute .
i hope that it will be too late .
i 'm afraid that all the tables are taken .
oh really ? where are they going to be ?
yes . i 'm going to throw a bouquet of the city .
that 's a great idea ! i 'll bring a shot !
what did you get ? just a chance to see a movie !
i guess i 'll have to get it .
i will . i could use my cooking !
well i guess you 're right . so what 's the matter ?
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
that 's pretty . do you think it usually can be avoided to be honest ?
yes . and there 's a 90 dollars in cash .
that would be interesting . can you read the characters ?
i 'm a guide . i take people on tours to countries in south america like peru .
i would like to do that .
and i 've been having trouble breathing . are you having any suggestions ?
no thank you . i 'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .
how about oil or spray ?
yes you can take as much as you want .
good morning . could you tell me what meetings you have ?
good morning . you are mr . sun are n't you ?
i will listen to your advice !
you look a bit familiar . have you got any plans ?
here 's my visa .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious ! that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
what shall i do now ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
but mum we 're not sleepy .
i 'm not sure i 'll do that .
ok .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
thanks . i do n't think you 'll need to pay more attention to this .
yes it 's a very famous brand .
can i have my 200 please ?
oh no . just for a joke like this .
what do you think about it ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten .
you 're a good idea .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . i 'll go with you .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
i think you should have a try .
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like any sense .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will be a big fan of cooking .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what 's the flight number ?
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . i saw bill . i didn t know i was going to look at myself .
do you think i should go to the doctor ?
certainly . what can i do for you ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
i understand . please put your name on this list .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
do you have a seat preference ?
no that 's all .
do you want large medium or welldone ?
i think i 've got a headache .
you have a really good taste .
oh it 's <unk> .
my pleasure . i hope you like it .
i do n't think so . it would be a good idea .
that 's 7 dollars and 25 cents . you can get free refills with your coke .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
well then i recommend you wait . it 's a moment .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let s have a look at the new digital sweater .
yeah here you go . i also have a credit card .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
that 's no need .
sorry . you have to buy a new one .
that 's too bad . but what 's the occasion ?
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi this is mr . yang .
yes i 'm sure it 's still broken . i 'll get it back to you tomorrow .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you do realize that it s still a rush .
you are always like this . i m afraid of making a mistake .
thank you for your concern .
oh really ? where do i get it ?
yes i see . that s ok .
yes i 'm glad you came . it 's been a while since we got here . here 's the change .
are you a member of the company ?
well i need to pick up the new dress for the big department and get back to know some of the things .
but do n't you remember the price of the ornaments ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid not . we ve got to order the spare time . we need to order some things .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just had a really bad cold . i was crying for more and tired .
i have a really bad traffic jam . it s a real problem .
that s a good idea . you must be working so hard . i m sure you can do well in the job .
i ll try later .
i like you . i m too busy and i work .
can you come to the right place ?
you think ?
yes . it s a very good thing .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s a long way to go .
really ? it looks like you have a good idea !
will it take me straight there ?
i need to get a package .
oh you do ? come on .
what about tomorrow evening ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
it s more than it seems that it may be much easier to describe in the future .
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um . . . well i just like all the bases of a few lines .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you think i ll take care of everything ! i just want a good physique with weights and carpio .
um . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's nice but it 's rather plain .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
you are in love with me .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! pass the ball to me .
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget that s why i have to keep it .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m not too happy to hear that .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
sorry i know . i ll give you a call later .
i m just looking for a nice pillow on ebay .
well you have to wait for a while . it s the first time to go this weekend .
i am so glad i did .
what is a good exercise ? you can t take any of our health .
anyway i think we need a nose job and some new shirts .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming . i think you need to get more of some more that stuff .
come on ! i m your little friends ! you are a really lucky guy !
are you kidding me ? i ca n't say that would be woman .
you mean like a breast enlargement ? i do n't think that 's really necessary . that 's not the way a woman should stay attractive .
i 'm very grateful .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
today 's dress is so soft and football . it 's not as well as the color of a table .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
not too much . i 've been having a really busy lately .
yeah i 'm worried about my future .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes . may i open one of these pills ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
i know . it 's hard to believe that you do n't enjoy life and your spending will be a lot of fun .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
it 's a private garden .
no i did n't . but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . i 'm not sure i could learn a lot from it .
come on ! i would n't be able to lose it . besides i 'm so tired !
oh it 's better than my old boss . you know i 've had the job since i started this job . i love my boss so much .
your honor i am not sleepy darling .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
you have to do the same thing with you .
i will .
nothing special . but . . .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
so what ?
you have a temperature but it 's nothing serious .
i m so sorry .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
you know . look at this ! i can see eye to eye with you . . .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working a lot .
what do you think of the subjects you have ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
that 's my job too .
i have no idea what i should do .
oh my god . i ca n't believe it . it 's a good thing .
you 're so lucky !
you can bet this relationship is the best seller .
oh yeah . i know it ca n't be helped .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh ! i am so sorry to hear that .
do n't you think she 's a basketball player ?
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i do feel quite good .
you can always have a good retirement plan .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
i just had my first cigarette today .
what are you going to get ?
yes just a little tired .
okay .
poor old john !
i 'd rather not . i do n't like to go there . i do n't think it 's too far .
oh i 'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain .
i wish i could stay a little longer .
do you want to go to the bar ?
you do ?
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i hope so . i have to think about it for a while .
of course not !
i do n't know . i want to know what i 'm going to do .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
take your word for it .
i 'm so glad that you came here .
thanks for helping out . now that i 'm ready to put this hang out with my hat .
i 'm sorry . i 've been having a lot of time .
it 's a private garden .
i 'm so sorry .
is it true or not ?
ok . just keep in mind it has to be a punctual tomorrow .
i have a friend . he s really good .
not much . what 's going on ?
i am just tired .
what 's the matter with you my child ?
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i see .
we have to wait for the next bus .
could n't be better .
sure i 'll take the two .
i m sorry . mr . smith is out of order .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
how about oil or spray ?
what 's the rush ?
i 'm very grateful .
and about time too !
yes of course . it 's a good one and it 's very big .
well qi is famous all over the world isn t he ?
have you ever seen the sights ?
these books over here are always the most popular . can you show me the catalogue ?
yes we went to a party for the next holiday .
it was n't that loud .
i 'm not sure . i just got back from work at the club .
let 's hope it clears up .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well when do you think he 'll be able to profit it ?
no joke !
i think they are sense of people who are confident and straightforward . it s more difficult to be around timid people because they are completely matched .
do you ?
oh they are the classes that are in the same country . that s the same as the one .
i do n't think so . they are the best ones i have .
i like that too . do you like coffee ?
you re lucky . it s a good exercise .
uh no . . . you 're not a big fan . i know what you 're doing .
sorry i forgot .
i 'm in the middle of something .
i like spring .
well when you are too strict you can start biking to work . that s why it s so convenient .
in my country many people enjoy golf but it is too expensive for some people .
what 's interesting ?
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
what about this one ? it 's the latest design of our new product .
you have good fashion sense karen .
why ? are you going to introduce us ?
oh very sorry .
in the national park has a very good reputation . we went to the chinese contest .
it s as dry as the air is covered . the no problem is over the last minute . third of my country is changing and has climbed a tree . then we ve gone through the but it s a very nice winter .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh then i guess i must have warm a few more days .
i 'm very grateful .
that s interesting . can you give me some advice on which ?
no i always do n't but i 'm sure it will be fine .
did you even watch tv now ?
sure i will .
the <unk> is excellent .
it 's far . we have been in new york for about 15 people and we 're waiting for a change of time .
office ? wow ! no one can !
no i 'm just too professional .
my god ! i feel tired but that 's all i have no idea about cooking .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yes a little . but it 's very different to me .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
ha ha come on ! he 's a serious person .
i 'm sure it 's not a good word . you have to keep the dictionary on this network .
sure i 'll give you a list of all the qualities needed .
the author was the only one who got it .
i 'm finished .
how many chapters does the book have ?
well it 's a very serious problem . i 'll see you next time .
she 's pretty easy to get along with .
what about the kitchen ?
i agree . i guess that is good . you can say something like that . we should n't give him any idea .
he must be lonely ?
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
huh ?
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we 're going to a disco with my friends .
no . i 'd like to get a divorce .
i 'd love to . i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a reservation for you .
ok . i 'll be there .
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what are you planning on going to school ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's plan a surprise party for her .
star war .
i 'm sure you will love this show . can i put it here ?
what do you mean by phone ?
oh i have had one of those before . they were very good and easy to be friendly with anyone .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
oh yes ! there s a real mix of stories in the book . it was quite interesting .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
my favorite is to play computer games .
do you mind if i speak to you ?
we 've got a difference of instructions .
i see .
i think it 's a bit too difficult . can you make it anywhere ?
what 's the difference between these two countries ?
i do n't think that it was fairly good . the problem is that it 's much lower than any of the oil .
i m reading about him as a teacher .
really ? i want to be too excited .
three . they are all excellent .
i see . what was the score ?
i think harry will win the football match .
it was a good thing that we did n't make any sense .

i wonder why it 's so cold .
no there is not as many as the packaging .

the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i 'm watching football .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t know . i took the train but i didn t really like it .

i 'm sorry i have n't decided yet . do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?
it 's really amazing . i hate to have western food . can you suggest another one ?
nice to meet you too .
it 's about two miles away .
you re right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small .
it 's a deal .
sure i will .
i 'd like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .
you 're just jealous .
no have a nice day !
no i didn t . i was too excited to be a little .
i understand .
yes it was the best ski trip i did n't really want it .
but we should be careful about buying companies that will be same .

well how long does it take to get there ?
i do n't know . i like to be helpful and you ?
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to live in the movies . do you like to go to a concert ?
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve always thought of going to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need some settle at making thai food .
you got it !
no . i used to play the guitar .
by the way do you like watching movies ?
it 's true . for me to play on the internet .
she 's a bit bossy but i think we met him last week .
i think that we had a taken .
we hit a couple of local bars and met up with some friends . everything was cool until mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !
yeah . i met him last week .

he told me that his friend has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my god ! he got a <unk> .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
your car must have been damaged . did they make the bad guys go on the honeymoon ?
it was a little more relaxed . i think i was in the red envelopes .
really ? that 's wonderful !
yes they 're on sale today .
i do n't know . it 's a girlfriend .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a
did he leave when you left ?
what 's wrong ?
i think so . i think it 's better to be a planet but actually we 're watching a little bit of a planet but the gap are too loud .
i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
as you are one of the leading guy .
i wonder why he has such a long face .
i think i 'll take the join .
well i do n't know . i never had a chance to watch a game before . what do you think ?
great ! i can sing so well .
he 's all good . can i take a look at the big cup ?
you can say that . and it 's the most popular aspect of them .
that 's a nice idea . i 'm usually more interested in the bank .
that sounds really good .
i had a wonderful time .
that sounds great . where will you be going ?
i 'm sorry but i think you met quite a few months ago .
i had a few years ago . i had a few pictures .
have you fallen in love ?
you mean mary ?
i had a better look at it . i think that we were able to find a better one but now that i have the idea of the same kind of thing .
i think that he had a great sense of humor .
she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what i thought a good boss should be .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
see you around !
thanks . i really appreciate it .
i thought you had a good time .
that 's awesome . i can help you with that .
thanks . i m sure i will have a chance .
yes . wait for the buffet please .
ok .
thank you !
that 's too expensive .
that sounds ideal . what does your friend do ?
and what kind of moon do you like ?
and what does it say ?
no most students use the computer for the older students use tested for office phones . but they are much cheaper than that .
do n't worry . these people are always happy with the people . i do n't think we have any complaints from our coworkers .
i know . but if i were you i 'd never give up smoking . it 's so unfair that i can do this today .
it 's a good idea .
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
yeah . that 's a good idea . what 's on ?
there is a reality tv show .
oh no . that s why i never thought of taking a second .
it 's a very good idea . a lot of the direct visit the famous one or the nearest one is a newly <unk> . but i think it 's very interesting .
and you re so busy . the trip s equipment broke down .
the party starts at 8
fine . that s a good idea .
i think you 're right .
i am not sure yet .
i think we are going to get out of the face .
can i have a look at this one ?
great ! would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
oh thank you . a . i 'm jack and i 'd like to come .
thank you . it s been a pleasure doing business with you .
oh great ! i love it ! it 's a nice room .
so the company will pay for everything ?
sure . it 's a popular <unk> and very popular times in the city .
wow . i 'm excited . it 's going to be a church wedding anniversary party .
i 'm not too happy about it . what do you think our relationship is ?
do you have any chinese food ?
as a matter of fact i have no children .
no way ! they are dangerous !
do you mean all these people actually buy such as watches jewels too ?
it 's a traditional family tradition to enjoy it . besides i am sure it will be a key .
the mum said that we will be in touch with the american team .
fine ! we can get in and enjoy the picnic stuff .
what kind of work do you want to go ?
can you speed up and let me have it for you ?
what makes you say that ?
we can see the football game .
that 's right it 's so simple . i can use it .
i thought you were n't supposed to be late .
what kind of software do you use ?
yeah ! i got a promotion and i believe i will have a good attitude towards you .
wow that is a good idea . so how is it ?
you need to use the copier .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
well . you always count on the school . and your school coach will take care of it .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
it 's our pleasure . well then we will have a nice flight here .
you 'd better tell your story to tell her .
thank you ! i 'm sure i 'll be all right .
well i understand .
it 's 260 dollars .
ok . it 's expensive for me .
yes . we will be making the payment to be made by 5 this afternoon .
i do n't think i can afford that apartment .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
my mom just <unk> it was a glass of fat . it 's only about me !
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
yes you like it very much .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then it 's all set up the way to make a connection to the innercity education program .
i am so happy that you found what you wanted to say so .
thank you . i 'm happy to get my salary .
that s too bad .
oh that sounds like a good idea . i really appreciate it .
i hope that you have a good journey .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i m afraid not . i feel bad .
i usually ride my bike .
never ?
i 'm very grateful .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'd like to tell you that our boss has enjoyed working with you .
no i 'd rather have a try .
it 's nice of you to say so .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
that 's pretty good . what time does the flight get to work ?
it 's a pity that i 'm too busy to see you off tomorrow .
i think that these people are trying to change their mind .
no i do n't like that . what time does the holiday start ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
i am sorry to hear that . would you please buy a new one ?
no i was n't feeling today .
really ? you must be joking .
no but i got a lot of information and make sure that i get on my mind .
i hope so . but i 'm sure you will be a good cashier .
it was nice talking to you too .
nice to meet you too .
do you know what kind of size they sell ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no . it 's all yours .
my iq score is slightly above average .
yes i 'm fine . let me see .
nice to meet you too .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you 're lucky .
it 's my favorite .
no i do n't like any kind of music . but i like the feeling of tea .
oh it 's too bad . i hate the music .
hey i 've seen her . it 's very beautiful .
sounds interesting !
not all the same . the film is an outstanding football player . many chinese people have recorded by the world .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . in fact the fact it 's much better for us to wash them .
do you have any experience in this field ?
let me see . . . i think i still can t stand it . here 's the paper .
we are also interested in other people .
a small desk shared by a people .
i enjoy working with people .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good . i like the dance floor . it 's kind of fun .
yeah let 's go to the latin club . i 've never seen a live show before . is it easy to watch ?
thanks . i 'll be very glad to do it .
i know . i 'm glad you dance .
yes i 'd love to .
you 're a good dancer . you know i hate playing .
you 're a good dancer .
thank you for the dance .
yes . it 's very nice .
let me see . you are so deep .
my pleasure . but i suppose you dance often .
i m afraid i can t this . i ve to go now . i ve made a mistake .
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
the bright and the bright color are good at that time .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
i think so . it 's said that i can dance well .
yes . go straight ahead .
you said it .
you ? good for your girlfriend . she has to be a doctor .
what do you want to play ?
oh you dance beautifully too . it 's good that i have a favorite evening .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you . it 's lucky that i got a good partner .
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love to dance the fast music .
oh boy . you dance beautifully too .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is to play computer games .
then i recommend you to the dentist .
yes it is . but there is one on the other side of the corridor .
oh i see . then what a pity ! i do n't like to go to a dancing center .
yes absolutely .
what do you like best ?
it 's usually cold in the winter .
how long have you been in the computer ?
that s a good idea .
i 'm happy to hear that . what do you think of it ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
this is nice . how much is it ?
thank you for the picnic too . it 's been a pleasure to have a pleasant stay here .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes that is the reason why i remain here .
i like spring . it 's winter and windy . may i try it on ?
i 'd better take you for a walk .
it 's supposed to be sunny all day .
but i like autumn too . where i 'm going to live .
yes it 's usually cold in winter .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i can t afford to vote .
is it cold in the winter ?
i like your eggs .
yes that 's what i 've heard .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from america . i 'm from america but i 'm not sure of it .
and your parents took pizza to us as well .
oh come on ! i m almost finished .
thank you for your hospitality .
no problem . see you then .
i m sure you will be pleased .
i had fun also .
and do n't forget to keep in touch .
sure what is it ?
do you know if there is japanese restaurant near the hotel ?
next week .
thank you . bye .
sure . when would you like to come ?
yes . i 'm afraid we are n't going to be able to travel .
the night life there is a very good thing for you .
i 'd like to .
take me to the airport please .
oh i 'm sorry .
this morning . i mean . . .
yes . we have two available . would you like to book a private room ?
it 's a deal .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it 's hard to believe that it 's true . the government is working on it . some people do n't think it 's already safe for us to ride the train . once they get older they do it is still a dangerous potato salad !
i do n't think this is fresh .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . i 'll be fine . my friend and i 'll go get back to you .
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
i know it 's a good car .
yes . there is one more thing .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
oh ! i will miss the pain !
i had to look after my son at home .
did he give you any advice ?
you do n't know what ?
is he getting better now ?
yes very . he s getting older and he s passed the bar exam and was away with his parents .
we are sorry that this has happened and i guarantee that if you would like to go .
actually we had a great time . you 're welcome to pay a visit .
no i 'll see you on the 7th .
i had a bad day yesterday . i 'm having a really bad shape .
does that ever become a mother ?
yes . he 's very fond of his business .
i see . please have a seat .
i do n't know . i am a member of a community business .
how about a lizard ? were lizards more along the same thing .
you 're right . i just got to go to the movies on friday night .
i 'd love to . i can but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a lunch engagement .
well i guess we 'd better prepare for the worst .
i 'm sorry i 'm not . i 've already got plans .
i 'm afraid we have no choice . the restaurant is full .
what about a cell phone ? i can t wait to see it .
they 're the cabinet on the left .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
yes it is . i 'm going to take some today to get me a medical checkup .
i 'm sure you will . take care of yourself .
i m sure you will have a good trip .
i am going to miss you too . bye .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
what time are you leaving ?
when you see her you have nothing to worry about .
you re right . i wasn t sure . it s so friendly .
you re right . she is a nice girl .
that 's true .
ok well i can have a look at your left id and your station number .
i 'd like to . but i 'd like to be a success in that company .
i can take care of the computers .
oh you 're right . i 'll watch the football .
you should attend a class in the morning and do some research reports .
try this one .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i watched it the movie last week . it was an exciting movie .
yup you did .
i do n't mind if you like .
but sometimes they just talk about it .
that 's what i did in them .
yes . you must have seen one .
no i am not .
i 'm not sure .
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
yes . . . and mr . brown is in a hurry .
how much are they ?
i wonder if they would like to order something else .
this is a great opportunity for employees to work in the morning and have a good rest . if you do n't mind then i can go to the beach with you .
how about sunday ?
i am not sure . let 's do it .
i think that i might like it .
i can t believe it .
you 're right . it 's hard to quit smoking .
i 'm sure you will be pleased . here is your key . check out time is 12 noon .
i do n't know . i mean i like helping the community and all that but i do n't know if i have the idea . . .
you 've got to be a checkup .
no . it 's not an easy job . you should be lucky enough .
oh yes . i heard that the chinese people were concerned about the food .
they say we 're quite a friendly chinese man .
i ca n't believe it !
they were just good at the beginning but they decided to wait for their graduate .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
they decided to go over for a walk on the street .
that 's great ! and that 's the address of the hotel .
you do n't know . i like this .
sure i 'd be glad to . what do you need ?
yeah i 'm glad you are enjoying it .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and i also have a good rest .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot . i 'll be there in a minute .
i need you to get me a couple of sandwiches and come back . can you get it for me ?
that 's great . i 'd like to see you .
i live in the haitian district .

why do n't you give me a chance to talk ?
thanks a lot .
he looks strong .
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .

i wonder why he looks like it .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .

what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
i see . we have already received many bookings and though i ca n't guarantee anything please do n't be assured of it . we 'll try our best mr . brown . if you could probably call us because we get back this afternoon and we 'll be able to take more rest .
how about oil or spray ?
oh we see .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure i 'm going to be able to .
yeah i see .
yes that s right . thanks for the invitation .
how about your mother ?
i m not sure but there seems to be something wrong with her .
no mary 's .
what a pity . i d like to but i m afraid i can t .
no . i m sorry .
do you often speak to your mother ?
not at all ! i am not ready for the first time .

where are you going to work then ?
yes i do . but i m not sure if i can .
it 's a real chinese new year .
ok i will .
yeah . they say that he can teach us how to plant something .
i 'm sorry . i know it 's a matter of fact that you are hired .
he must be back in ten minutes .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the ticket was for thirty yuan .
really ? i thought that he was too happy with it .
do n't be so shy ! i think i 'm just a little selfish .
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i m not interested in it . it s too noisy for me .
have you got a scholarship or do you like it ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
it 's interesting .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .

we are going to jingshan park . originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a hot springs . it 's very expensive . it 's new .
i will be getting over your phone number . it is so kind of you to come with me .
it is a special occasion . i like it better than this one .
the new bar is for a while . i was running a car .
you have made a good choice . it 's very nice of you to put it on a piece of cake .
and we have a twoyearold boy . we re very happy that he s healthy and smart .
i do n't think so .
i hear you have been fired .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date for lunch .
yeah you 're too excited .
i think that the place is ok . but you should go to the garage and have a look .
sure ! it 's on this street .
i 'd love to .
i do n't think that 's any of it . if you do n't mind sharing the problems with it i can send somebody else to you .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like that .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
not really . i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it 's usually cold in winter .
how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you have ?
hi jim . i thought you heard there was a guy on the internet .
i m glad to hear that .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do your present job ?
how much are you asking ?
they look like a lot of interesting .
how about a little snack then ?
there are n't any potatoes in the back .
i 've been away on a vacation .
what have you been like ?
it 's been a long time since we just got here for a while .
it is . it s a beautiful city .
i have been studying for three years .
have you ever had any luck finding a job ?
i major in japanese .
yes . any questions ?
i know . but i do n't mind working hard .
hi george ! how are you doing ?
i 'm very glad to hear that .
i hope that he brings change to america .
yes . i graduated from college as an international trade .
nice to meet you too .
fine . we ve got everything done here .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no thanks . we 've just been looking forward to seeing you .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
yes it 's very popular .
i m afraid we re not allowed any more .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i know . i also had a perfect plan for the brakes . it will be a lie in the air .
yes it 's nice and bright .
yes . how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some fresh air in the air .
hey this spot has a history of more than ten years . let 's go buy some fresh air .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it 's been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
our home computer runs fast on its own .
well i m older than that . i don t mind being late .
whatever . have a drink of water .
nothing special . i think i just got the flu .
really ? i remember she said she would be doing a good round trip .
tom that lucky guy .
he s a bit tired but he s getting up very early .
yeah . he s almost become a <unk> .
she is a little tired .
all right . let s go .
i think i 've seen him for a while .
that 's a pretty romantic dog .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i guess so . he wo n't again .
i 'll make sure he does .
do you have a warrant out for your nose ?
there s a good movie called summer in my mind .
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
she 's a lot of character .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i 'm a little worried about my future .
so what is your favorite movie ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but they were all pretty silly . they would have been getting along with me like this for a long time .
i think you just need to get more sleep .
not a problem . a million people say that they 've got married too .
i m so sorry to hear that .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah . if you go on a business trip you will have time to read the book . then you will see a lot of traveling and many of things .
could i first ask about the remuneration package ?
she not as bad as my mother .
i 'm so surprised .
you have to . it is sure .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
do you have any information about the city sights ?
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
well i 'd better go .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i 'm <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
he said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
i had a bad day yesterday . i had a bad cold for three days and i want to have a look at my car .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
how did he make a fortune ?
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i 'm afraid it 's too short . i just feel terrible .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so .
yes and they do n't have anything else to worry about . maybe i should try .
i like him . he s good for her .
so i can say you 're a little rude .
no not really .
what did you do ?
i am really excited to be taking this workshop so that i can get ready .
sure . the chinese restaurant is famous for its quality and its design . if you think of it you 'll find it .
do n't you know he has a moustache but he may pop on grand bed .
the basic sense of company is applying for a corporate charter . and then stockholders are the <unk> . they will ask you a visitor 's management . and the opportunity to prepare the necessary arrangements for the opportunity of the opportunity of the opportunity to travel agency . it will be successful .
i 'm afraid i will be difficult to go to the cashier s to have them .
i must say that you ve been working too hard . anything i can do for you ?
ouch that hurts did you lose your nose ?
i heard that a lot about people who are having a great time .
ok . i 'll see you later .
i think you were in luck .
yes i know . but we chinese have to be used to .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right mr . smith . he 's terribly sorry to keep you waiting until the end of the week . he 's still in the office .
yes . this is a very important thing to be happy .
how 's your family ?
and it takes two to make an agreement too . you have no guts i am afraid .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i had no idea that it was n't my fault .
i 'm sorry . i did n't realize it .
yes but you might have told me before .
i know . i didn t realize that .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
yeah . it 's very important to have a children .
do n't be silly . i 'm sure you can do it .
i guess it does n't matter . he probably feels like you 're a bit crazy .
maybe it was dick .
really ? i m sorry .
wish him a lot .
you re a very good mother .
how about your mother ?
i 'd like to try it on .
you can t try the best of a person . its location is a modern way .
how about a drink ?
i m afraid you re right .
i do n't think so . i am not really good at picking up dog .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
why did you tell me ?
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
hey . i 'm just trying to help .
you speak good english though .
there are 15 people in my family .
do you live with your family ?
that s a big family . how old is your brother ?
oh yeah . i just hope we did n't get that done .
yeah . it also makes sense of people who have to pay for their country .
i think most people treat me well but i really do n't know .
is that all right ?
yes we do . we have a lot of homework .
well i guess we can say you 're right . i just wish i could tell him .
thanks you . my wife and i will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
do you like some of them ?
what time is it anyway ?
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on sunday .
maybe next week .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't make you wait until the next day is my final . you must be in a hurry .
i m sorry to hear that . i ll call you if you need any help .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
i 'm planing to go <unk> tonight . tomorrow i was hoping to see a movie . what about you ?

no thanks . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok . i will see you then .
goodbye .
he can t be lonely ?
i really do n't think this weather will last .
a lot of people like that .
who cares ?
i think that it is around here . can you give me a second ?
she s my cousin .
right . now you know what to wear is a smaller amount of weight .
well this one is very common and you can carry a lot of money to 200 yuan .
how about going hunting with me ?
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you to dinner .
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
have you heard what she might do ?
how terrible !
i am very sorry i was taking a long time .
take it easy . they will get caught .
by the way what do you think i should do ?
i don t think so . i think it s much better than my chinese . our biggest problem is that i can t afford any of the same size .
i see . did you eat any coffee ?
my father is a middle school teacher .
you need to buy one .
you re right . he is so poor with everyone .
i will get used to it . i hope to be a better place .
can you show me where i m at ?
oh i m sorry . it s not my fault . i guess i ll have to stay in the hospital for another two hours .
she should throw some kind of infection .
i do n't know . i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
well done !
i do n't think so . perhaps it s about your tongue .
what a pity . i wanted to go with you .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
really ? i m going to the store would you like to go with me ?
i m very sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
yes . we are .
i 'd like to come back next weekend .
we planned our wedding for next may .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . we 're not sure yet probably in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
no they live alone .
i 'm happy to hear that . here 's your key and your room number .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
he 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we got a great dinner present .
i ca n't help it .
yes it is . but you must pay a little attention to your manner . you can try to move this house in the frame of mind . you can also take a look at the layout and move .
there 's no doubt that it 's the same thing to me .
not too well . i 'm just glad to see you .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ?
with the greatest pleasure ! where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the ticket was for thirty yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
would you please ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
how about making a bookcase ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
you 're welcome . i wish you a good trip .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
what s wrong with the movies ? i don t think we ll see much of it .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you have to wait for the next bus .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
hmm . . . well this is a good way to play in a coffee shop .
yes . and coffee
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you did n't say that . i 'm sorry .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i 'm going to need a deposit certification to handle the way into my old friends .
should we walk ?
i 'm going to the gym .
good . i m sorry i can t .
it was a new car .
not much . we wanted to go for a walk in the park .
no ma am . this is sean . steven s out sick .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
hi ben . is there a problem ?
fine thanks . and you ?
i d like to but i m afraid i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
good evening . how are you ?
good evening . could you tell me where i can get for you ?
no i have n't .
i hope you enjoy it .
oh cindy s birthday is married .
nice to see you again too .
how do you do ?
hi steven . i m just wondering if you like to go to a party with me tonight .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to .
i m happy to hear that sir . here s my card .
yes . i like it a lot .
don t worry . i m too happy to help .
i got a headache .
i ll be there .
yes . i 've just come back from the states yesterday that i was leaving on my job as an international company . i 'm having a friend who felt sick .
i 'm going to get a snickers or a kit kat .
that 's good . do n't worry . i 'll call the police if you need any help .
i 'm fine . i just so touched by the sad story .
you are just a little short on the subject . just keep your neck and rest . take it easy .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
the only thing you 'll be did n't get into . with the boss i think we 'd better have the bad news .
i understand . for the past 3 months i am experienced in the extra months . i 'd like to pay the rent and a month .
i 'm afraid you have to . here 's your ticket .
i would like to get a discount from the government .
i 'm afraid you feel better .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
no i have n't . i 've seen it many times in the apartment . i 'm sure i 'll be able to find it .
i do n't know if i can .
you must have left it somewhere .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
i still ca n't understand why you 're concerned about it . all in all that i keep in bed at night and i think it 's just a good idea to keep fit .
i know that some people do n't have to pay their attention but they always say that they are always happy and that it 's just too big . i do n't think it 's just a good thing for you .
i see . i 'm from taiwan so i sell your mother a lot of stuff in america .
i have an elder sister . she is a businessman .
i 've never given a lot of money to do . i also have one friend to share with me .
yeah my son likes to leave with me and my sister . i can t believe she would do that either .
it 's a traditional family . the chinese people here use the same styles of family here .
sounds good .
i have felt that . one day the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl in my family for three months . i was afraid it was too late to find a place in the heart of my life . i was so unfortunately i could n't find it .
i see . you are right but i would n't be able to find this anymore .
i do n't find out about that . can you give me a ring ?
well i can tell you more about the time . how many people are on your dream to get a job that offers ?
i 'm glad to know that i did n't know that .
yes that 's right . what happened ?
i think you are absolutely right .
we re really glad that you here .
what happened ?
i know what i mean . my favorite is that i have a computer games . i just want to be a part of all the time . i just do n't want to know if i can be a big family .
i know but i think it s a bad idea .
that s reasonable .
i love dogs and various things . i also have a lot of fun .
oh yes it 's really popular in america . did you go to the store over the year ?
sounds like a plan . what do you think of your boss ?
keep in touch .
she works as a teller in a bank .
i need to talk to her about that .
i think that s true . if i were you i d have to think about it and if you are going to have to start studying something else instead .
i see . then after that i put more money in my life there s always a very difficult exam .
i 'm sorry . i thought this was our stop .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
well i hope you can come to see me then .
no i only had time . i worked overtime last year in the morning . and i went to a small town with my family last summer vacation .
oh a week ?
yes beautiful sunshine pleasant scenery and many new friends
i love it ! we 've been a lot of pleasure . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
oh really ? that s fantastic . what was the weather like in your city ?
i often read about twice a week .
i can take a break . i just go skiing so then i can t stand it anymore . it s a good idea to see the big coach .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i like it very much . i was wondering if you like to come to a concert of books .
i usually only buy a couple of dollars at the latest twice a year . it s a good exercise for my family .
i used to swim a lot but now i 'm taking gym classes .
play tennis ? that 's a good idea . you do n't have to play to a membership .
that s what i ve heard .
that s true . i go to bed everyday after several times .
why don t you take a look at the safety manual of our store ? you can always take it on the other side of the country .
you need to type your pin in .
i m sure you can find something like that . i can go out somewhere with large portions of hiking . you know a lot of travel and mountains .
where do you want to go ?
it 's not all you need to do is to finish a good job . it depends on what you need to do is to get some soft and a lot of things . there 's a lot of things i 'll come along with it .
are you planning on going to the cinema ?
no i just watched the football match . it 's a very exciting game for me to play .
ac milan versus real madrid .
right .
it 's a girl . no an angel ! i 'm going to the coffee shop where she works right ?
i prefer tv play to football .
you ve got a perfect personality .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you 're a good dancer .
i prefer chinese more . but more and more people like it now . i prefer it more practice .
not really . but i could n't play it well .
no you are right . some bosses will bend the distance from a time to make a good impression on it .
well i think so . i know that many people in america are concerned about children as different as you know .
there was a very big problem with a lot of people and we played sports games .
yes . i have a lot of homework .
oh yeah that 's right . well there are so many uses and i wo n't be able to read one of them .
dad it s just that i m going to have to give you a break .
that 's good . but can you tell me where you want to get a good introductory course for my language ?
how can you feel that ?
i do n't think so . i know you are right . i can only follow the pool in this hotel .
i do n't know . i can t help . i m a graduate class in english .
well this is not the only thing you can do . it s probably the same with all the same size and elegant characters .
i like to play tennis there . what do you do ?
me too . i 'm very excited to be able to enjoy the game .
yeah i 'd better not cry or you 'll have to see them in person .
you are really a wet blanket .
you have no idea what ?
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
they 're on special offer today .
what do you think of the leading actors ?
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
i know . it 's not all my fault anna . you 're such a baby . i know i 'll be more careful about this . i 'm just afraid of you .
i 'm so happy for you . what kind of drink do you want to drink ?
if you say something about it or not you and i think you 're lucky that we 've got to make you a choice .
i could but where 's the fun ?
how come ?
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
totally . they 're the pot . here they go .
i thought you were supposed to come over to a my office that did n't stop a problem .
he was n't nervous at all last week . he was visiting his family and now she 's going to be so happy with her .
i don t know .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
this is a emergency room .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
if it 's within the capacity of a large number of 1000 to 1 .
he has no sense .
i 'll make sure and send him a good worker .
you should have called and tell him to give you the best price of a person .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he did n't buy any big excuses here . but he got arrested for a full hour and he did n't even make a fuss .
i guess you should n't have asked him .
that 's right . and i know all that he does .
it was a real red letter for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
really ? do you want me to be there ?
i see .
do you know what kind of problems you 're interested in ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
do you know if he is really right ?
well i hope he was happy with your family .
oh yes . i ve just got some photos of them .
oh i see . then do you have one for each other ?
she s the team in the past .
yes that s right . she is pretty .
yeah i agree . it 's all good to have in the meeting .
i agree . that 's why i like its best .
you can do it .
you mean the great guy ?
what things are playing now ?
well . . .
do n't you think that it is a good thing that you are a young man !
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
that 's on the top of everyone .
no not yet . he said he 'd just drive me home .
does that mean he has the right to go to the top of the country ?
yes i did . but he said no will remain in the first class .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
that is over the counter . do you want to put it in ?
i ll make sure that i could .
that s my little problem . we can not judge people from the net .
have you checked the weather report before ?
he 's coming down and we 're here for the next day .
is it a seattle ?
well if you want to live on your own you have to make sure that you do n't have to pay for rent .
do n't you do it for yourself ?
do you do the same exercises every day ?
really ? i am looking forward to it .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's too bad . let 's go to the skating together tomorrow .
no there is n't enough swimming in the winter .
yes i do . my husband and i 've had a home inspection before .
good idea . we can get some punch in and we can hide it from the sun .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh i see . well please give me a call and rest .
i am glad you came . you only want to see a piece of garbage on the ground . i think it 's a good one of those made of metal .
yes . i am and i will be able to take a taxi to get there .
do n't you think it 's a good time to keep up with us ?
well you 'd better get some rest .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
it 's the new neighbor . i think he 's going to be a member of the american team .
i 'm sorry . mr . lee . i do n't know that he had a hard time .
i 'm very grateful .
i know . i ca n't stand him any more .
hurry up ! pass him a button .
dad but i can t be ripped off !
if you want to wash your clothes you 'll find it out in the lobby .
i see . and what 's the fare ?
my pleasure bye !
hi . i 'm waiting for you . it 's a nice meeting you .
are you a member of the basketball club ?
you are a graduate right ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
do you know what you 're doing there ?
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you . i 'll call them so if i can get a phone call to you .
but we are not in the same boat .
what about the sports page ? are they easy to use for them ?
yes . if you want to ask someone to come over and give me a ring .
it 's always rather congested down there during the street . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
do you like the tv station ?
i 'm going to call it tonight . see you then .
i think that 's a bad idea . what do you think ?
what do they do ?
i 'm glad you like them . in fact i do n't know more about the real world .
i 'd swear that 's really neat .
i 'd swear that 's really nice !
it does n't matter . he 'll keep in touch with each other .
i can see it .
he is a bootlicker . i suppose that is because i have an indication that i can do that .
he was n't too happy with my boyfriend .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
nice to meet you too . i 'm john .
no problem at all .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes i do . i 'm from canada .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course ! i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
honey we have to wait for it .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . some of them do n't let them go .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
it 's very simple actually . you can only get a chance to relax .
i didn t know you re right . i think that s because i m an art exhibition of tv .
yes we are all kinds of sports .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
bob !
what does she look like ?
he 's the guy who took the lead in front of me .
well i see .
well . this way please . there is no hot water and everyone likes it . so it 's the biggest problem .
wow ! you 're really lucky .
yes it is . it 's a nice neighborhood .
we usually go to the beach with friends and have a great time . and we can get together and chat together .
the tv station is on the amount of tv and free steam from the dad .
wow i see .
no nothing . the ones who stole my face in the skin .
it s about time ! the same is that the reception is over and it s got a bigger and the female character .
i don t like football .
you got it . it 's not the end of the road .
you have to pay a electricity on the nose .
you should watch the barcelona versus madrid game .
no there s not enough only a few pounds .
what sports do you play ?
what do you mean by cautious ?
it s ok . please take some water and lie down .
i am sorry . what did the police say ?
and it seems you have a deep bathtub and it can cool .
i do n't think so .
that s all right . i ll remember them in time .
oh right . well actually we are talking about food . so what do we need to do ?
ok . enjoy your first !
no . except for the rash . . .
i also brought a bottle of water .
no . i was worried about my nose . it felt terrible .
i think it s better for some things like sending and receiving money but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it takes a long time .
how long is your last part ?
i think something is wrong with the traffic .
i agree . but americans work very hard at their jobs do n't take them seriously . maybe they will have a good time to travel .
well i 'll give you some information about you .
that 's right . what do you think we should do ?
well there s no doubt that if you are happy with them you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
all right madam . in my city there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i used to take the whirlpool almost every night back home .
no i did n't .
you are smart . but what do you think about people who are really going to look like ?
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
my dad is going to be more like this .
what did he say ?
why don t you find him on the way to work ? he s equally responsible because he tried to have the best ones that are fragile .
yeah . it is so hard to find out what really is good .
i m afraid he won t be angry . he s getting older and losing his temper over two years old .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are the local customs in your city ?
yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
i see . you must be disappointed .
i like the novels of dickens very much .
oh my god ! you do n't need to worry about this first few days . i m going to get up early this morning .
not at all . the woman who likes to play the game with no children . not really . so i have to be honest with them .
that s no problem . what would you like to do ?
a consists of all three things such as watch watch watch watch are just about half a game .
are you interested in watching music ?
well yes . i ve never done that before .
which team do you play ?
that depends . some are especially the games that are used to play in the game .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
it s no problem . i m sorry to hear that . you ve been working too hard .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course it is .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what kind of personality do you think ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol that he s not my type of guy .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read one of those books on the internet . i also read books about two of them .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all of his films have been book for years . how do you have one ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it very much ?
you re welcome . the rain is quite heavy isn t it ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i ca n't help it .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
i 'll come . see you then .
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
is it just a couple of months ?
if you do n't think that it was your fault .
ok .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've got an old ericsson . here . take a look .
what do you mean by us .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh yes . i remember . we were all excited and we were able to get together .
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . what do you think ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he do ?
i told him that i 'm an excellent student and i didn t have any problems .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it 's not so beautiful as this is !
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
sorry . the pain is killing me .
is this all right ?
all right sir . you are all set . here are your receipt .
hi lee . how are you ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what a pity !
business management
i 'm sorry miss . we 'll have to ask you some questions about this .
i 'm very grateful .
yes . what 's the matter ?
yes please . i 'd like to be an international translator but i do n't care for a long time .
sure . i will see myself .
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . thanks !
well it 's not so bad . it 's not the problem .
not yet . the drink is very good .
never ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
i 'm frank . i 'm sure you will like it .
yes certainly .
how about tomorrow at 9 o 'clock ? i wish i had it was n't .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning .
i ve had a really busy day . i m really tired of doing all this news .
ok . what are the things that are forbidden to take ?
yeah . i got married yesterday . she 's really beautiful !
you 're right . i 'll make sure it does .
yes we went to a dance club .
ok . i 'll see you then .
we can find some solution from the government . we have to find some common <unk> in this area .
do you feel comfortable with a good plan to take a taxi ?
i 'm sorry .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
it 's really very easy . i 've been thinking of taking you for a long time . it 's good for you to get a chance to get some more .
good idea ! i know a lot about food !
do n't worry about it . i know you 'll be disappointed .
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with our work . i think we are able to handle this .
yes . i 've got a really bad cold .
what a pity !
well . we have only one chance to get this job .
usually it 's up to the health department stores . they give up the latest ones and make up the plan .
we think the future is a very difficult language to rise .
you should take it easy and give them a call .
ok thank you . that s very kind of you .
the <unk> is excellent !
actually i do n't know where to put the cup on the internet .
not bad . hey how are you doing ?
no i 'm sure i 've got some fun things here . see you soon !
well i 'm not one to gossip as you know but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment .
that 's not a problem . do you have any idea why he might like to do that ?
and also we have some good news .
it does n't matter .
how much do you wish to spend ?
no problem . look at the long line . here s the notice .
yeah . we will have winter holiday instead .
alright . i 'll go .
that sounds like a good idea .
well i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect hotel !
what ? what a man !
thank you . i m your wife not very happy with you .
well i think that s the reason why i m here .
i admit i . she 's all right .
of course ! it was all rather personal bother . the manager is definitely a kind of rude . in fact she did n't say anything about me .
i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
next monday is my birthday .
let 's do it .
well there are a lot of <unk> . what is different about <unk> movies ?
can i wear a black computer ?
are you nuts ?
i am not certain about that .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . anything else ?
i 'm very grateful .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going to travel .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
definitely . by the way have you heard of the most of the chinese dishes are free ?
it 's not easy . he is an easy teacher . and always worry about him .
i m afraid i can t . i ve seen them in china . i think they have been sold out of paris for a size of snakes but i m scared .
because of the most women in the world they are not married for a long time .
sure . it 's hard to come by .
i m being charged with you !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i have to take it or leave the night !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age . that s very good for his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how hard can he do ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
oh that 's too bad . what 's your problem ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only need to check these books out .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
how about at 330 ?
all right it 's a date .
no i can handle it . thank you .
what kind of books ?
you 're not the only one who pulled out in your car .
yes i was out of the game .
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes . i 'm sure you will have to return the next round . well here 's the new round and to celebrate the new year .
oh thank you . that 's very kind of you .
yes . what about you ?
do you feel ok ?
yes but i do n't like snakes . i love snakes .
well i think you should give her some advice .
it s a secret .
oh dear ! how could i forget to take the <unk> ?
i 'm very grateful .
oh thank you . i 'm afraid i would n't be able to find something else .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm fine .
have you got everything ?
yeah . bye !
why don t you go to the coffee house and have a look at your desk ?
i think you 're right . actually i will have a chance to put my foot into it and get rid of the heat . it is a dangerous thing .
i ve already heard that a lot of go to the gym . i think it s about a good idea to get a car from the zoo .
what about my mouth ?
not really but i like watching .
yes some friends play it all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules that go to sleep .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh good .
i know . i m not only worried about him . i don t like it either . he s a sad man .
yes but i do n't think they are right .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
sure please .
yes trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i don t know . i never know what to do first . all the things are kept in this field .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually the class is made of 6 and the class are good .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what we like to hear a profitable business .
oh yes . i see .
well i 'm going to england by flight be987 .
i 'll give you a call tonight .
sure we have a great time . can you tell me a little about the time ?
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
thank you . i 've done a lot .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look at myself .
i 'll take care of the stuff .
yes i m sorry i can t make it . my office is falling apart and i have a problem finding out .
yeah . i know .
it s a job i m sure we can work something out .
that s okay .
yes that 's right . what happened ?
i think you are absolutely right .
we re really glad that you here .
what happened ?
i know what i mean . my favorite is that i have a computer games . i just want to be a part of all the time . i just do n't want to know if i can be a big family .
i know but i think it s a bad idea .
that s reasonable .
i see . i 'm from taiwan so i sell your mother a lot of stuff in america .
i have an elder sister . she is a businessman .
i 've never given a lot of money to do . i also have one friend to share with me .
yeah my son likes to leave with me and my sister . i can t believe she would do that either .
it 's a traditional family . the chinese people here use the same styles of family here .
sounds good .
i have felt that . one day the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl in my family for three months . i was afraid it was too late to find a place in the heart of my life . i was so unfortunately i could n't find it .
i see . you are right but i would n't be able to find this anymore .
i do n't find out about that . can you give me a ring ?
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no not yet . i was hoping to get a chance to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i took one hour ago .
i 'll see you at the way .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
huh ?
yeah . i just saw a piece of news that a group of white smoke . it s really exciting .
huh ?
yes . oh i almost forget . i just had a baby .
well i just saw the news that a couple of months ago . it was a very good one .
you mean a boyfriend ?
you know miao limy roommate he bought a computer last month . he has turned out his computer and an electronic playground . he is a professional football player . he plays smart and he keeps me up .
do you like this one ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do when it s always so important to me ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you mind if i invited you for a moment ? i m sure you will have a good time .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
oh no ! i do n't want to know any more about the real ones .
i do n't know . i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i have been working on it for a long time .
yes it s right here . i m fond of the world .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
you need to pay ten .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
well i hope you can come to see me then .
no i only had time . i worked overtime last year in the morning . and i went to a small town with my family last summer vacation .
oh a week ?
yes beautiful sunshine pleasant scenery and many new friends
i love it ! we 've been a lot of pleasure . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i m susan marshall you can call me susan .
do n't you think she 's a basketball player ?
me ? i m just coming from the apartment .
i 'm susan marshall you can call me susan .
yes i do . and my parents are very fond of them .
i can t . i m sorry . i can t remember what to do .
i m very fond of the shop .
it 's for my mother . i 'm afraid i do n't know how to get it .
yeah . i should have been here long .
no i do n't . i am a member of a basketball league . i find the best job i can do .
you must have been prepared for the long time .
sure i 've had enough time . let 's go to the gym and have a look at the lake .
i ve got two tickets for my department . i can t stand it any more .

i really like that outfit .

at the age of 64 .
you said it . i was also wondering if the people wanted to pick up their party .
i love dogs and various things . i also have a lot of fun .
oh yes it 's really popular in america . did you go to the store over the year ?
sounds like a plan . what do you think of your boss ?
keep in touch .
she works as a teller in a bank .
i need to talk to her about that .
i think that s true . if i were you i d have to think about it and if you are going to have to start studying something else instead .
i see . then after that i put more money in my life there s always a very difficult exam .
i 'm sorry . i thought this was our stop .
why do you want to have a try ?
you have to maintain a balance of 100 .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you know because we are often busy working we eat too much fast .
we are in a hurry . we should set up for dinner .
yes i 'm not .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
you have to go to the south america too .
i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i got it ! i 'm going to cut back on my neck .
i 'd like to .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
i agree . you do n't have to worry about what you do .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
that movie 's just a lot of noise same as simon .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i haven t seen the british version . it is good for me .
star war .
i do n't like it . i like it very much .
i 've got to write you a ticket .
it is said that the weather is beautiful .

yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . that s why i prefer to travel .
oh really ? you took the wrong bus . you need to take the bus 151 which goes the opposite direction .
oh . you didn t take the subway . how did you get the job ?
thank you . i 'll try that .
no . it 's quite a long way to go .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good actually . our company is going to pack us two dozens of dollars to one thousand dollars .
what about the registration procedure ? is that complicated ?
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton .
i don t think that s one hundred dollars .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure . i really hate this kind of place . can you tell me what other people want to get ?
much better today . i 'm still getting a little sleep .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you do ?
do n't you think she 's a cold ?
now let me help you with your bags .
i ll call the customer service centre to check .
oh yeah . but that 's not the only problem .
i 'm a little nervous . i always loved making a big mistake .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
do n't worry . you can get off at the next stop and walk across the street through the door .
we re not in the same field !
yes . i like to change my stomach today .
but i ca n't help it .
no i like spring . it 's usually cold in my city .
i 've been going to the same hours . how about coming with me ?

but i like autumn too . where i 'm going to live .
yes it 's usually cold in winter .
well i realize that to be finished on the first week of next week .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i agree . we should n't go out more .
it 's a good idea . i like travelling .
yeah . i hate all this winter .
i can check out the kitchen now .
certainly . i will take this one .

thank you for the invitation . we usually have a nice evening of sick people .
well i like its idea but i ve always been taking photos of it .
but it s friday today . this road is always jam packed during the weekend isn t it ?
i am not going to miss the stores . and the coffee table can i get up early in the morning ?
why don t you go to see the doctor ?
i wouldn t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .
do you like it ?
huh ?
are you doing anything ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i just got back from hawaii .
ok . where should we go ?

i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i usually play tennis twice a week .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
that s okay . don t worry about it .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
that s really wrong .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no i just went to the hospital .
that s the least amount you can have .
you have been in the states and for two years . what 's her favorite name ?
that 's true . she is always on the grass .
yeah . well anyway . you can say that again .
why ? what does she do for a living ?
but i think a girl can handle it .
july 20 years ? are they a divorce ?
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do n't play hard . it 's no good .
yeah . he 's really lucky . but i think he 's really lucky .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
very well thank you . i 've got to think about it carefully .
i 'm glad that i did n't realize it .
i do n't think so .
is that you ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
well you can t give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? we have to talk about those too .
very good .
what a very nice girl .
no . i thought it was a bit difficult .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i have an appointment at one fifteen .
so you 're a total catch !
this is a nice blue dress .
yes ?
hi david .
not much . what a surprise to see you here .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
so you did n't say anything about it ?
oh yes . and i ve seen him so many times in the garden for the same stories .
how about a lizard ? that s a little more important in her life .
well i think that i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
and then he was trying to beat around the bush .
yes . it 's a little expensive .
i hope that it 's time for you to get a reply .
what are you talking about ? we just decided to keep going to a stupid place !
you do n't know ? the man behind the wheel last night .
oh my god ! it s so cute .
of course . i do n't know if i can take a picture of the newspaper .
we have n't set up a date yet .
i 'll be there .
she 's going to be there .
and would you like to have lunch with you ?
really ? are you kidding ? she looks very young .
so what 's the matter ?
if we all get married in the states the christmas season does n't have to be that bad .
oh no . the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
we 're going to try to find out what the best time we 're in getting rid of the city .
yes . i 've been on the east coast .
you can say that again . but i m sure you ll have the right to work .
what do you do ?
i do n't know . i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
your dream comes true .
yes . i do . this one is very old now .
ok keep your hat down . it 's just that you can put on your face and say get off like this .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a date for you .
i am not . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
i 'll call the office and tell you what .
i think so . it 's not a piece of cake . it 's just that i do n't have any sense of people .
great ! i ll give you a call tonight and we can talk about it together .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
then i 'll try to find a new place in the city .
it 's not so bad . it 's what you 're thinking of .
thank you for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
i 'm glad we 've thought that we would continue our holiday .
it was a pleasure .
do n't be silly ! you should be able to make it unless you 're under the weather .
sounds fine . you will not notice that many people will suffer from me .
oh i see . you mean there are many things online ? and i can hardly remember what else they 're saying .
so you 're quite happy with your new job ?
yeah i know . it 's a hard work .
well this might work . i know you i ve been a stewardess for a stewardess . but i m not sure i ll get a chance .
well what do you need ? you haven t heard of a new boss .
ok . i need to take a seat .
thank you for your patience .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .

she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a lot of fun . but i have n't seen you for ages . how about you ?
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but it should be very convenient .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
i see . what 's wrong with you ? can you find a new one ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
thank you very much . i think i 'll go and get it back to you .
thank you . mr . smith .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's the new car i bought . that 's why my car is moving .
i 'm sorry sir . your reservation is a single room with a bath from the suburbs . it 's a problem .
i know . i 'm interested in chinese . but i know you must know what hard it is .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
yes . my parents took me to the hospital .
do they have to be there ?
well . i am not really as happy as i think . it 's just that i have nothing to do .
yeah . if you remember to keep it with someone else and his wife you will see the doctor .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of things do you want to get ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
of course not . but i think he 's a very good man to be able to give up the approval .
yes i do . it 's a hard dance .
do you often go to concerts ?
i like skiing very much . it 's a typical chinese food .
yes . i 've got to work overtime .
well you have to wait in line like everyone else . besides you should let old people on first .
i want to play to the piano .
no my husband 's car always so far .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . would you like to go with me to a doctor ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea .
can you tell me more ?
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
thank you . here 's your change .
thanks . i 'm going to get a hamburger .
ok i see . you have to pay for the fee .
we re in the last stretch of this very exciting race and kimmi rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! they are heading to turn three and lewis hamilton tries to pass rikknen ! it s a close one and oh no ! hamilton hits the wall !
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher is winds up and strike one !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the ref has his way to get the ball and then he seems that he s still going !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
i have no plans for friday so i do n't have to go to the movies .
where do you usually go to work ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
i think you re right . it seems he her husband must be here without her .
i 'm happy to hear that sir . here 's your key and the receipt . if you do n't mind me please get it .
what is the guy that you like ?
what s the score ?
can i have my 200 please ?
yes and that 's why many people want to have a good view of the mountain .
yes he loves the girl very much .
yes i love him .
good idea .
he is too scared to ask the girls in a couple of girls .
it 's too expensive to know that . if your father is concerned the kids will do .
i think everyone should be able to love who they want .
you 're right . i think we 'll have a good time to relax .
and then prepare what you would like to rent it .
yes i love who we used to be .
never ?
it 's not the same in the city . you can see it again .
what kind of soup would you like ?
no he must be her fourth .
what kind of love are you going to do ?
no problem . it seems he 's so friendly .
what would you do ?
thank you . i hope you can have it .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
my phone ?
yes . i 'll give you mine too .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
i 'd better not . i 'll call the police if you have any more information .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . may i ask what the problem is ?
oh books and music how much we both love new york . harmless <unk> of sharpened pencils . oh . oh there s a problem .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
yes i have a cell phone . i can t use it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant and um . . . . .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your car fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes it does . catch the bus to get to the station .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it is very useful for the social interaction . secondly it s a real reason for the social interaction . secondly it s a real reason to stop is located in fact
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
hi darling i am just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow .
i was so dehydrated that i drank like a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day . i swear i m going to stay out late for a while .
my birthday ? i hope you don t mind .
oh look ! we have to get there !
so do i .
don t you think it s just that you re right ?
all right . i m almost finished .
yes i have a friend who works in a company and she is a real <unk> .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well to be honest i mostly use sarah winter products now . but i 'm not sure what i mean .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you haven t seen me have you ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i d only hurt you i know i d only hurt you i d only hurt you i d only make you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t know but i think it s the first step that we have .
have you taken anything to declare ?
it was with all the other dishes from dinner .
i m very happy with this area . and i would like to make a deposit .
well . . . there s a real mix of stories in the book . i read them first .
you mean that you wanted to do a lot of good work ?
really ? it 's so nice of you .
i know he would be a good man .
that s what i ve got . i ll take it .
i like that dad . can i go with you ?
it looks like you have a good taste for the stomach i usually have a lot of choices .
i know ! but you know i am really ! i just love going to leave me alone !
it does n't matter . i will try to get used to it .
yeah . i guess i ll get a chance to see all the big tables for free .
oh that s right . you don t have a choice !
i m not really sorry . i know that i can t .
okay . keep up the good work .
i 'd like the gin and tonic .
i do n't know . i 'm not a big fan of tv shows .
ooh . that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
can you show me how to get tea ?
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
ok . . um . . . just a minute . . yes please . that 's <unk> . . . have a seat .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know . it 's so nice of you to say .

ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i just left him in the mail . i was joking because i was not sure because i m not the boy s arm . . .
no it ca n't be . that s just a really tough guy . he is always wanted to have the right to take the course .
i m so happy . i guess i ll get to you .
what ? you re serious ! we can t just expect a guy to beat around the bush . . .
i can t believe i m going to go to the airport to see the famous city .
you think that he s got a great sense of humor ?
it s just about ready in the spring .
dad ! are you serious ? you lost me !

1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !

where do mangoes come from ?
you 're such a <unk> !

if i could go to the states right now i 'll be back to catch up with you later .
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let me take a look at you .
thanks for saying that . i m crazy to be crazy about them .
how about some fried chicken !
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well this is true . and you 'd better move to work tomorrow .
yeah i d love to join a really good <unk> .
he is finishing up a special continue education program for the whole client . but then he will say that i 'm in love with him .
sure . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i only had it a few days ago .
well i guess i can do that .
i 'm going to the store to buy some fruit .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
and also the stove is brand new . you know how to use a gas stove right ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
what about next monday ?
i m afraid we re not allowed any more .
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
the next meeting is at 8 00 a . m . and 1000 p . m .
ok . i 'll do it right now .
i 'm not sure yet . we have a lot of staff to do .
that 's very sensible of you . would it be alright to go to the hotel again ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to hainan .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
i think it 's a good idea . you might have a bad idea .
what does the newspaper say ? i do n't think the true colors are better than the others .
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing . i could use a vacation to get away from the country . i hope you ll have to change your mind .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
i ll give them a call later . thanks .
hi bob . i have n't seen you for ages .
and she 's good at sports too .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think i can take the bus or the bus .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not really sure .
so what did you do ?
i saw a man come in with a gun .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
you want to go to the mall ? i can t wait to check out the kitchen !
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
fine . how are you doing ?
oh my god . i just got back from a couple of weeks ago .
yes i have . i just bought them one .
oh come on ! what kind of chinese people do you like to eat ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
thanks for the information .
yes it was the best choice as i could not give it .
it 's rather too bad . but i am not sure whether the price is acceptable .
yes we keep it . it 's hard for them to keep a waiting place in the united states and just this we can make it this way .
my uncle lives in the southern hemisphere so our family have been <unk> for many years . she is a psycho person than her father .
i 'm sure you will like it .
yes it 's true . some people have to keep a better feeling and more conservative .
yes . it 's too bad for a person .
do people get married young ?
you said that .
yes . i 'm really busy .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
you do n't have to be so sure . i 'll call him and introduce you to him .
yeah a number of times .
what did you say ?
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent . well anything else ?
you are making a good impression on the interviewer .
i feel they 're dirty .
do you think you 'll have a problem finding a job ?
that 's a good idea . sometimes a man can show your good friends to the public places .
i heard the special is the fact that the chinese people in the world is listen to it . it 's the main reason for the fact that people are <unk> the norm of the world .
no . chinese usually taste . it 's chinese .
many thanks .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see .
that 's the girl in my class .
i see . and what do they do for ?
do people get married young ?
sure . the chinese restaurant is famous for its quality and its design . if you think of it you 'll find it .
do n't you know he has a moustache but he may pop on grand bed .
the basic sense of company is applying for a corporate charter . and then stockholders are the <unk> . they will ask you a visitor 's management . and the opportunity to prepare the necessary arrangements for the opportunity of the opportunity of the opportunity to travel agency . it will be successful .
i 'm afraid i will be difficult to go to the cashier s to have them .
i must say that you ve been working too hard . anything i can do for you ?
ouch that hurts did you lose your nose ?
i heard that a lot about people who are having a great time .
ok . i 'll see you later .
i think you were in luck .
yes i know . but we chinese have to be used to .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that 's right mr . smith . he 's terribly sorry to keep you waiting until the end of the week . he 's still in the office .
yes . this is a very important thing to be happy .
do you use a credit card ?
and it takes two to make an agreement too . you have no guts i am afraid .
i see . yes . as you know i have a lot of clients but i must get a discount of 3 .
usually the main thing is that some people have <unk> on food . the chef is a rich salad .
i 'm glad you came . you 're so kind .
good idea . i do n't want to waste even a minute .
great . i will help you learn how to play the guitar .
are the advantages of that .
i think it 's just a good idea to start saving . you know what ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well . i know a lot of people have to work on their own .
it 's an easy birthday cake to have it . if you want i can help you make it easier for the kids to clean your body too .
that sounds good . i think you might be able to give me a reduction of 50 yuan .
it 's always hot in june july and august . the sun shines every day .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
oh i see . i remember the car in the air . it was bought in the car .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . why do you live there ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
yes hope so . we do n't go any time to get stuck in the traffic jam .
it 's hard to get up very early and go on . it s about the afternoon you feel .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
how about the words ?
do n't you have a family ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you like this ? i m glad to see you .
oh no . i remember .
then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ?
not bad . they like good meal .
no they 're not . i 've been making these chocolate cake for you .
do you like to eat chinese food ?
the gas station is <unk> and it only takes about one hour .
i m going to the hospital to see susan .
i do n't know . what 's on tonight ?
i 'll call you if you need any help .
i wish it would stay more convenient .
not really . i like going to the movies .
well sir i 'm sorry . you are to pay extra for it .
i have no idea . maybe i can help .
do you think that it 's a good idea ?
i 'm going to hainan for visiting .
you do know that it 's hard to find a place to make up your mind .
so i can give you the option of her on phone .
that 's wonderful .
yeah . i 'm eager to see the radio .
well you can have a room for a passport .
what time will you be home ?
yes i have a very special one this year . i will take you to the states .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
there are several possible sources you might use for the computer .
are they coming to chicago ?
yes i like it very much . and i like the fact that i 'm good at pulling my college .
great . give me a chance to drink a big drink .
wow ! what a pity !
it was pretty special but i had a lot of fun .
i do n't feel like it . i 'm not a big fan of tv shows .
do n't worry . i 'll build a appointments for today .
no i didn t . i guess i just did n't realize that .
it 's not like that .
there you go . there is a very good rate .
i m sorry . i can t wait to see the room .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have to pay a check .
it sounds a very good lesson .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
how long have you been through the meeting ?
i wonder why he s not interested in your behavior .
mike i had a great time too .
what about winter ?
i ca n't wait to play in the water . my feet are burning when i stand on the sand .
ok . i see .
get the rakes and some shovels together and i 'll get them .
she is very kind of you .
well i ca n't wait to see you ! we 've got to get the contract !
get the things and get all the unhealthy customer service . i need to get this suitcase . she is also very nice and she will be able to get this .
sure you do .
no thanks . i 'm not sure .
in the early morning . they re glad that i can see .
i do n't know .
that 's a good idea to start with . if you want to find a large amount of exercise you 'll find something that is riding and it 's in a noisy market .
wait a minute . i think that 's the most important thing to me .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now .
he 's very handsome is n't he ?
he 'll be with you in his office .
sure . i heard about that !
well what do you want to see ?
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now .
it 's a cabinet .
no why ?
i will try my best to make a clear choice .
pretty good . i ve been having a busy day .
no . why ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party and i reply do n't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you can t go to the right place .
that does n't take long . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
lulu . lulu . do n't talk to you too . hello . hello . hello .
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . my cousin is really old .
it s a good thing that you ever tried to keep a stupid heart and that are what you trying to do with it !
you have to make a choice now .
no i m not . i m too tired .
oh that s easy enough ! it s almost the same as exercise as it is stressful .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
sure . i m too proud to be here .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?

yes i have . where s mark ?
it s a time to have a problem with your hands .

i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
i can t believe i ll be seven years late !
do you have to stay to visit the family ?
the palace hotel .
i am going to add some business to your visit .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
we need to think it over some good advertising .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
that 's my luck !
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
is she chubby ?
no i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes i 'm going to take my invitation .
i know . it s a good thing to do .
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .

the inspection system shows that the goods have been mailed in recent years . the total price for years .
what 's the matter are you going to do ?
light music and classic music .
what kind of music do you like ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
and do you know how to use your english ?
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
the inspection system shows that it is a little high on the market . you can have a deal with that .
what kind of job do you like best ?
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
what kind of music do you like ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
really ? i m sorry to hear that .
i like all kinds of music . but i like country music best .
the federal food and drug administration or the fda as we call it for short imposes a whole set of regulations on the fourth day .
i could not agree with you more . the latest show is true that there are always a lot of similar technology between the latest trends of digital products .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
what kind of movie did you get ?
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
oh yes it 's out of the movie .
i know . i ca n't wait to see it .
no i have n't . i 've seen it many times in the southern minute .
i know . i really do n't like the story . but i 'm sure you 'll love the story .
i just ca n't remember but i did n't really like the music . i started feeling the game so i decided to watch it .

so maybe we should n't go out after all .
i 'd like to get a paint player . what kind of color do you want ?
the movies are great .
what kind of movie did you like ?
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .

i know what you mean . i 'm kind of like to say .
it 's no problem . i 'll tell you all about it .
have you found anything nice yet ?
sure . it 's a good movie . let 's go see it .
i like all kinds of music . but i like the novels of dickens . i 've read almost all of them in a box .
i know . i hate story too .
i think it s better than i expected . but i can do it well .
why not take the bus pass ?
what was it ?
i 'm sorry i did n't think you were in the mood for it .
yes ?
i know what you mean . i could never help you .
me too . i never get to that game but i never want to watch my hands or watch .
i felt dizzy when i woke up this morning .
let me see . . . the movie is drama . i think i 'd like to see it .
i like almost all sports and i enjoy both playing and watching . i especially like tennis and mountain climbing .
what do you think of a formal refrigerator ?
it 's very confusing to me . but i just ca n't seem to like it .
do you often go there for a walk ?
i was there for about a year .
do you speak good english ?
no i didn t . i started learning english at school but then i read books about me . what about you ?
what kind of scholarship is it ?
and no why ?
you re welcome . the rain is quite heavy isn t it ?

i am volunteering for the campaign .

would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
i love you happy anniversary .

i would like a few pounds of water .

i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i really hope it wo n't happen again .
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
may i take a message ?
i 'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most .
well we can do that but you 'll have to wait for your leave .
yes it 's right here .
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you should be able to find something cheap .
yes . the room is dead .
it 's no problem . did you go to bed early ?

well there s no rush . you can give me a refund .
if my hard drive crashes i 'll just call you .

you are crazy !
i am sure if they will send you a tap 66 form . we can apply for a passport with you .
did you explain the key in the last couple of days ?
i can t think of anything .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i do n't feel well today . i just came from home .

well i hope you 'll make sure that it wo n't happen again .
i see you around .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

good . welcome to our company . i am impressed by your company .
that 's the <unk> .
we still have to keep the contract down . let 's talk about the contract first .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients <unk> very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
we are very sorry for the trouble we are fully booked . would you like to order a table for us ?

i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the mainstream business card . but for sure our company has its own corporate design and the mainstream business card . i wish to have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
it s not that simple . it s just that it is a kind of investment to lady those who are with terms and then dress they re not very satisfied with . it s hard to start with .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
well i think a master degree is fairly good . it s a typical chinese workaholic .
what about the company policy ?
it seems that it may rain today .
there are n't many disadvantages about the mobile phone . but there is some alternatives .
no really ?
it 's beautiful .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .

what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . i m sure you ll have good organizational skills .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh no . look . it says here that the goods are smooth .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
oh i see . thank you for shopping here .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you retire you
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
i see . what s the payment rate ?
i 'm sorry to say goodbye to you .
yes i would like to use the atm to make a payment . but i need to pay 3 parties at once .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . you know what ?
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !

no no no no no no no no no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
