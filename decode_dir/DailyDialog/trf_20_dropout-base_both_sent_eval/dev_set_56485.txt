we can take a bus there .
does this bus go there ?
i 'm afraid not .

no it 's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let 's get on . oh no judy ! get off the bus quickly !
oh good . let me see . . . . sorry . this is the number 13 bus . the bus station is full now .

sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
tom has gone to lunch .
the have you taken your library card ?
do you accept credit card ?
oh that means i ca n't make sure for my own .
i 'm in a hurry . how about the taxi stand ?
it depends on the job . it 's actually more costeffective than buying specialist equipment that we do n't use very often .
is it the only way i can afford it ?
can you stay a little longer ?
is the bus station close by ?
how do i log on to the computer ?
sure just a minute . mark you 're wanted on the phone .
please excuse me wo n't you ?
maybe next weekend . she only mentioned this before she left .
i know .
i 'm sorry . mr . nelson is not in at the moment . he has gone out .
oh no ! i 'm going to be there .
about 600 .
by all means .
it 's a private garden .
oh do you really think it s a bit sore ?
do you know which one he would like ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
oh look ! there 's a folk concert called which i thought to go to the boxing hole in this morning .
i am not exaggerating at all . i 'm telling you the truth . that is why it 's called the air .
well i do n't think so .
and i 'll see you around .
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
it does n't matter . no one will laugh at you .
no i do n't like the style .
i 'm sure you 'll do fine .
it 's very kind of you . i 'm so moved by you .
it 's very kind of you .
what 's the matter sir ? honey you are in college now .
do n't you like it ? i did n't know it .
honey it 's my turn .
oh that 's all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .

yes i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .
how often do you meet ?
yes sir . you can take the no . 36 bus from the meter .
can you tell me when it leaves ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't . it 's for your reference .

what time are you leaving ?
oh no .
the job market is so competitive nowadays . i want to develop some useful skills .
come on . that s no problem .
no i 'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
take it easy . there are many things you can do .
i think you have to update your cv . i 'll see your credit score .
let 's see . from here you have to take the 278bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
you should get off at the first shi da stop .
ok thanks . . .
you 're new at this huh ?
no is it difficult ?
no it 's quite simple . when you get on just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
is it far from here ?
it depends on how you want to travel . if you want a soft sleeper it will cost <unk> rib if you want a hard seat it will only cost <unk> .
wow i ca n't thank you enough .
i 'm glad you like it .
i want to send some important documents to canada for my postgraduate admission .
what size prints would you like ?

a taxi will be here .
i ll call you later .
cash please .

oh i 'm sorry . you can bring it back to me back whenever you are ready .
i 'm afraid they are too busy .
size one . by the way what if i bring home this sweater and my wife doesn t like it ?
so a taxi it is .
dark brown if you have it .
ok but we 'll take it .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .

yes . there are a mouse and a camera .
i want to send some important documents to canada for my postgraduate admission .

so the guest is <unk> and table is at seven o 'clock .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital .
maybe you have a taste for it .
yes i 'd like to .
a dessert sounds nice .
could you tell me what ?
the same as the bus is coming .
i 'm really surprised .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
that 's harsh .
no way !
yes we 're meeting .

i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
happy birthday .
now i 've got it . thank you .
i 'm sorry . i did n't hear you . it 's a bit too far . would you like to wait a minute ?
that 's reasonable .
why not ? i think it is a good idea .
ok . i 'll see you at the time .
it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
i 'm afraid it 's a bit far .
good . see you later .
no thanks . i 'm really hot .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !

i 'm sorry we do n't . but i think you 'll have to wait for the next one .

well honestly speaking i d say the room is a little small for me .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .

oh yes it 's just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
do n't you think it 's a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . the chinese women and the other .
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes i could . i even lend them to my wife if you want to go with me for a holiday .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?

i heard about that . it 's a very good thing .
what 's this sir ?
that s something that you really need to work on .
i 'll go and pick up your ticket .
are you serious ? how are you going to do that ?
i know the short of the company is the most experienced and the employees in this field are not so easy to do . they are high in shape and generally however they have more than i do .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes and the tv program also has a little funny on the field .
i hope that it makes you feel better too .

i love you as well .
um let 's just trim that the egg is coming with the sand .
yes there are a lot of options . i like that one myself .
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
i do n't think i can manage that .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding me ? i do n't know what you 're doing !
italian . they are very delicious . they have n't had the fish in the mood yet .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
i know . i 'm always in a hurry .
are you going to cook anything ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it is a good thing that i have learned some chinese food .
oh no . i 'm not sure . i 'd like to go to the butcher 's and get some meat .
blah . . . what 's that ?
ok . i will go now .
thanks . see you at school tomorrow .
i 'm most grateful .
it 's really delicious . the food is delicious and the food is tasty but the meat is a little tough .
well i think that 's a good idea .
what do you mean by this ?
they all have to do a lot of shopping for places . also i will visit them .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
anything you say will have the fine .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
yes i d like to use the atm to make a payment . but i need to pay 3 parties at once .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that . please give my regards to her .
you are right .
does she know what she is ?
do n't take that tone with you .

ok .
i 've got to catch the last bus .
yes nobody is ok .
i see .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well i 'll be glad to do the dishes .
yes . there is one more thing .
that will be most helpful .
is she hot ?
what does she look like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
if you change your mind let me know .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
that 's a great idea . if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well i guess you 're right .
well i thought it was a little different .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yes that 's right . just make sure to get more .
it certainly is .
oh by the way we 'd like to get back to the bank that 's in a bit of a hurry .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?

well i 'll take the bus pass .

it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well it 's a shop in the store .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
no way . i have some questions about my lease . what do you want to tell me ?
five yuan .
what were on saturday ?
what about the divided skirt ?
yeah they are pretty lowmaintenance they eat almost anything .
do you think they are worth them ?
i 'll take them . i 'll take some too .
most of them are from america and europe .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

yes you 'd better take a hot shower .
well i want to visit the great wall .
they 're quite delicious . you can order some chicken and i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the dinner .
would you like to have a try please ?
well you can send one or two tickets to the internet . that might be a little too far from the home .
you are an excellent decision . the price is on the high side .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
good . i 'll get my coat and come downstairs .
please . and i d like to have a hamburger hamburger .
ok sir .
that s a good idea . i m not worried about that .
that 's not far . we ca n't miss it .
goodbye .
nobody told you what happened ?
mmm . . . all right how many chinese tea are there ?
that s without a doubt . i can t stand that anymore .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
no thanks . i 'm going to cut back on my clothes and i do n't like the food .
nobody told you what happened ?
i want to but i m not really sure .
i m sure . you know he will be . i don t think he ll be happy . he gives you a lot of money .
oh that 's terrible .
are you going to take a look ?
i think something must be done .
we can t make a rather journey .
how late were you getting that rest ?
well i know you have to call for a new york right now .
don t you like the way that you re on your own .
i couldn t possibly . my wife and her phone number is working on it .
ok . i ll send someone to fix it .
i would like to leave the apartment as soon as possible .
i should tell you that the price is far too high .
do you have a car ?
i ve looked at your units and i am very happy with it .
where to sir ?
beijing university . do you know where it is located ?
all right . it 'll be one of the best sightseeing in beijing .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
all right see you then .
that 's fine . is there any way i can get my money there ?
if we go to danshui in the morning on a weekday we are sure to have seats since it 's not during rush hour .
here 's twenty dollars .
15 dollars .
oh i see .
thanks . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where are you heading sir ?
two blocks down the street .
oh i see . where are you from ?
you 'd better ask for my invitation .
how about 500 yuan ?
here 's ten . keep the change .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
are you kidding ?
that is a deal .
i do n't want to hear you today .
thank you very much . i 'll be sure to get there in time .
oh hi mary . you 're back already .
i 'm afraid you have to wait for the next two weeks .
ok . now you should know the rest . do n't forget to dial taipei 's city code . do you have a pen to check it .
sorry i am . i 'm new here .
can i have my 200 please ?
no way . i m afraid i can t . i ve had a date already .
ok . what did you do after you come ?
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! i am looking forward to this place . it is nice to have you been to this place ?
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think you can find anything .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the center of the city and the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's <unk> . it 's been sitting for hours hours hours hours .
very well thank you . i am leaving tomorrow .
i 've been working really hard . and you ?
ok . then you 'd better send a sample .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh thank you . you are the lucky customer of our company .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since yesterday .
i think we will be better off .
she 's pretty bad .
but what does she think about her ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
hmm . . . well that might be a good match . how about a movie ?
but that makes thirteen people !
how many people will attend tonight ?
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
i think you should keep the car longer .
when i put my elbows that you can t cut it so that i don t understand . .
oh i hope i can do that ! i m really tired !
what happens if i use it ?
great ! phew ! that was a close one ! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
well . . . i can never really use the machines but the gross <unk> .
what a cool game !
i m sorry sir . you just have to take the plug or a light on the road .
yes . could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in germany ?
how many pieces of cake do you have ?
i d like to have a try . do you have a natural one ?
you are lucky .
so you can read that one of the course .
no i 'll give you a discount .
i have heard of it . oh by the way do you have any other questions ?
thank you . you ve got a lot of books .
the perfect drinks and food ! the tea leaves are very good . i m sure you ll like it .
i thought you buy an inexpensive camera .
oh wait a second . where do you get it ?
why not ? i want to buy the same camcorder but that it s cheap and it s not the same quality .
what 's wrong ? this is ridiculous ! i 'm going to have to call the police now .
i 've already been feeling a little overweight . i know i must go now .
well i think you ll have to put in the bathroom .
thanks . see you .
i 'm sorry . i 'm totally pumped up .
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken <unk> .
the chicken breasts cost 4 . 05 per pound .
ok .
yes . there is one more thing .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
okay . let s go in .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i need this prescription please .
do you like roses ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
yes i can do that . this is the very thing i m here .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how can you be so sure ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i bought one of your vacuums from spendwart . it s a bit now .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a wireless <unk> player and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had a meeting with a client .
i can t believe it !
oh good . you re right . i m going to see you back in about 30 minutes .
there are some possible sources you did n't tell me . i also suggest that you use the machine and the machine will turn on .
oh good . come on . tell me your friend are coming to the beach please .
i was looking at this magazine in a different color .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
is it that the color of the style ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
what size ? these are the latest fashion .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but do n't worry . you 'll be fine . just give me a little more information . i 'm sure you 'll do the best .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s quite large and has a great balcony with a garden .
that 's the best part . the bedroom is very quiet and peaceful .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
ok . how much do you want to pay ?
can i have your name and contact number ?
there are two of you at the moment .
that s way too much .
what is that ?
what are you going to do about it ?
that s no problem .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please go to smoking ?
you would think it would be a good choice .
well i m afraid not .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i 'm sure i will . it s hard to find a place that suits me because i have to learn how you like it .
no i think i 'll take some friends and buy some new stamps . i m sure you can buy them as well .
obviously it depends on how many people i am cooking .
oh you can do that ? it s certainly a piece of cake .
i want the new apartment .
i 'm sorry . all the fitting rooms are filled with a bunch of flowers . i think it 's a bit tight .
maybe you have a point .
don t worry . i ll take care of it .
all right . i ll get them ready and get ready for the next week .
of course you can . we can find some nice brown clothing and brown .
we need a mediumsized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms .
all right . anything else ?
i want to try on a different color .
you re a real pal . i 'll let you know what i would like to do .
yes sir .
i 'm afraid he is at the apartment .
i was wondering if the manager has turned me in .
yes i see . let me show you the apartment .
i think that i would like to have a different carpet .
i think i will be going to look at it this way . it has to be a lot of noise and style .
good . i will see you then .
i 'll wait for you at the register .
no thanks . i already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like .
why not ? you 're going to get a seat over there .
well i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't get on that finished .
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i am sure the price is very tight . it 's on the invoice for the wear .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
that s great . so the train station is very heavy at the train . which platform should i go to the station ?
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i think that i would like to try that .
i m very sorry .
how about the kitchen ?
if i could help you in the kitchen i could n't wait .
you 're right . we can manage the grass and the flowers .
i m surprised to hear that .
will there be any extra charge ?
i will take it . by the way can you give me a rough idea of the price ?
we have each room .
that is exactly what you 're paying for .
how about the kitchen ?
i think it s going to be a great idea to have a relax .
i see . let me see .
i 've got it . it 's a good memory .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
let 's go check the kitchen .
ok .
that s for the man i ve seen in my life .
this is he . who is calling ?
hello mr . stern . this is hao bo from the international travel agency . i have made the plane reservations for you .
it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i can but i m afraid i can t afford the house for a living .
i love you too dad .
yes . i 've got to ask my secretary to take the class .
that 's great . all i can do is prepare some food for you .
sorry we have n't managed . but we can find out a table by one .
we have a deal then .
should i bring anything with me ?
no . but if you have any questions just ask .
yes are you available on the tender ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> . what 's the charge ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i 'm afraid i do n't . i 've had this idea for my graduate .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
well thanks .
well that sounds reasonable .
can i have my 200 please ?
yes . i just thought it was better than the old vaccines .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i will do my best .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university and the university of the university of taiwan are very strict at this semester .
yes . and you 're from taiwan ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the <unk> students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
what kind of potatoes would you like ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
all right . i 'll see you later .
i 've been wearing makeup for a while now .
what style do you want ?
not too long . the haircut is n't very clean .
that 's great . by the way do you want to have a drink ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you on that . i 'm not sure whether she 's not interested in the job or not .
i 'm sure you 'll have a good chance . in fact i do n't have to take much trouble with what to do . what is your favorite sport ?
no you must not have a strong match .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes it 's part of the building .
can i have my 200 please ?
i know what you mean . i don t know what to wear every day . there is no <unk> that .
oh . you do n't look very smart today .
really ? i don t like her .
can you work parttime or fulltime ?
ok .
yes i 'll see it .
sure . by the way what kind of drinks do you have in mind ?
oh that 's a good choice .
spring is a lively season . you can enjoy the seafood .
i know that 's a place to find a place near the university . do you have any other requirements ?
yeah i 'm glad you came here .
good idea .
why ? you ca n't be serious .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i know that . it is a good idea to have the proper time .
well we can do that but if you want it for you and i can show you how the price is .
well . i do n't have any in my mind . how about changing these days ?
that makes a lot of sense . we will have to remember the new cartridges it . the problem is the case that the offices in the house alone has been very good .
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
you can check the connections . what if we order is going to have a claim ?
are you looking for a small house or large rent ?
yes we can also see if you like the house .
then how about your new job ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
what about if we order a large amount of money from the home price ?
no problem . it 's a very simple one and it has a lot of wars nowadays .
no . but it 's a bit loud .
that sounds great .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about the new bar across the street ?
i 'd like to try traditional chinese food .
yes . i am really enjoying cooking .
oh yes . i remember when you 're out of china .
i hope i do n't have any problems but i think i 'll soon get a ticket for you .
i think red is orange and apple pie .
would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i have n't . i 'm learning chinese .
let 's go out for brunch .
maybe i 'll try to lose weight .
i 'm sorry i ca n't remember that . we have a full range of chinese ingredients at home . we can have a good english dinner this evening .
i 'm really sorry . i do n't know what to do . i 'd like to know some chinese food .
have you ever been tested for ages ?
yes madam . i think the local one is very good .
well maybe you could get the rakes and some shovels together and i 'll put them in the car .
i 've tried this before . can i try it on ?
ok i have to do that . i promise .
that s a reasonable number .
alright . and i can see that myself . thank you very much .
you 're welcome . come back again .
no not really .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
no . that 's not very easy .
i heard that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years .
then i 'll go into the one .
they are too bright .
that s a good idea . i ll go to the store and pick up the rest of my things .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i know . i think it s a great deal .
yes . i had a friend who had a free time here .
i 've heard that it 's a very popular hobby .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
when was the company founded ?
she was a famous company for a salesperson but she was on a street with a very good company .
i am very happy to hear that . would you mind coming with me to my office ?
the pass is free .
we can do that . the only thing we need is to check whether we can professor this is a good opportunity .
but you know the rest of the machines are getting enough .
yes . i 'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily .
do you have any luggage to check in ?
yes here you are .
what about our mobile phones and cameras ? did you charge them last night ?
i want to change my hairstyle . what about your hair ?
go and try it on .
oh i guess i can keep it .
would you like to get me something to drink ?
are you willing to buy them hard ?
so what about the price ? how much ?
what a pity . it was the best time i 've ever received .
i 'd like to talk to you about the safety of the company .
there 's a copy for you now . what is your bill ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you sir because i 'm an italian man and a large order of french fries would be great .
is this line for nonresidents ?
good . now just complete this form .
that 's fine .
i 've got plenty of that .
sure go ahead .
i want to know what you like to do .
that 's great . everyone is different from the chinese restaurant .
is that all right ?
you are right . i have to wear uniforms at private schools .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
they are . you 're right . they are too brief . they ca n't just do anything .
i also heard that the food was delicious .
you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and i 'll make dinner !
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
i 'll go and get a drink .
well i think you 're right . i 'll just have them ready for you .
i see . do your parents live by themselves now ?
yes i did . i spent the weekend at my house .
yes i 'm really enjoying it .
yeah it is a great opportunity to learn french skills . what about you ?
about three times a week if i can .
you know what i usually do with the rest of the day after work . i m not usually busy at a loss of the day . sometimes i need to pick up some helpful information and usually get dressed in the evening .
yeah . you know i could also find a parttime job to increase my income . i have n't had enough money to buy a car from a yet .
that s good . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
usually i ll cook a lot of things for my family .
great ! we have a great variety of condiments we can add to our perfect sandwich and without any meat .
i 'm not very good at cooking but i do n't think i can manage it .
so what do you think of the environment ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
yeah i like thai food too . do you like chinese food ?
my favorite is to be raised to board english .
it 's important to be healthy . i have to make the appointment with the 9 o 'clock .
now you 're talking .
it 's the one who saved the right time . you should not be so particular .
no . i 've never had a few coffees while i was waiting for you to get a chat .
would you like them with ice cream ?
i think i 'll have and thanks .
absolutely not . it 's a bad diet .
that 's a good idea . but i heard that it 's cheap for me .
a little bit ? i do n't think you 'll have any more to spend much time with a much weight .
cappuccino is onethird espresso and twothirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth .
she is also interested in the office .
so you 're saying that now ?
sure . i 'll try my best .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was hoping you 'd have something on sale today but i do n't think i could make it . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not ? do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
curry and rice .
i m not sure which is more fun the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ?
you really like it ?
i do n't know . i 'm really full of food .
what do you want to do ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have n't tried cooking but i 'm sure i 'll cook it .
i thought you meant vegetables . i am a little overweight . you really have to make dishes now .
i think i 'm going to go rest for a little bit .
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
good idea .
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what kind of soda can i get you ?
i 'm absolutely certain .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i 'd like to drink a lot of orange juice .
i ll have beer and wine .
i hope i can spend some time with you .
you really like it .
i do n't know what to order .
well that sounds really good .
i like the novels of inches very much .
but please do n't watch them .
oh it 's hard to say . you see the ones that i mean .
do you know what kind of camera you like ?
let 's see . you can pick them up at once .
i have no idea where to get it from .
there you are actually a number of them .

i have no idea where to get it from .
what kind of soda can i say ?
what about cigarettes or cigars ?
i ca n't bear eating less .
excellent choice . i 'll be back right away .
i do n't know what to order .
and would you like to have some dessert ?
i like chinese tea . i like the most are sweet and sour sauce best . we have n't had any sweet corn from the city centre .
but people should n't eat them .
men are like the red one that are orange juice .
but you must have done them .
why do n't you use them ? they are much better than the chinese ones .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
all right i 'll have them .
yes i 'd like a apple pie .
what about the red ones ?
how about some korean food ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you ve never really turned down on your mind ! what about some coffee juice ?
yeah right ! you are right ! what about all these things ?
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have some kind of pie .
what kind of potatoes would you like ?
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
that s great ! i never knew you would do that !
where are you going to get it from ?
what would you like for dessert ?
how about the rice ?
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have some kind of pie .
why do n't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ?
what kind of soup do you like ?
i think you 'll like them .
i 'm not sure . i have n't decided yet . can you recommend something ?
i have never tasted anything like that .
yeah right ! you are all right ! this is what i eat .
that s really good ! i have never tried that one but i never saw ?
you can use a public transport system to get a lot of money .
i have n't thought about it .
i 'm not sure . i 'm pretty sure about it .
so i can order a large amount of 250 dollars for a discount .
i 'm sure you can bring the wine .
another time ?
that 's great . we will be happy to have our own hotel restaurant in town .

well . i think you 're the right size .
it s going to cost you 25 .
i see .
i know . it 's a really good deal .
did you bring your ticket ?
how ?
i got it .
yes . we have one of the most famous spots in this world .
the early season is coming down the wall .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think you 'll have to .
ok i see .
but it 's very difficult to do them .
that s too bad . how did you have to pay for the kids ?
i got it from the train station .

your cousin fay is fifteen . <unk> is older than fay . she 's seventeen .

i was running around the track at the bank .
how much is the rent ?
yes it has .
it does n't matter but i can tell you .
i have it already .
do you think you can get the bus ?
i 'm sorry .
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
you can stay in the student health center and have a good stereo .
because i have to walk in the park before i 'll save the signs to the school administration and the sea .
that 's not a very good choice .
i was in new york for a wedding .
do you have a reservation ?
it was my only time .
okay here 's the form with a nice of champagne .

i 'd like a bag of chips .
what kind of ground beef do you need ?
i 'm going to need extra lean ground beef .
i 'll go get it for you .
i do n't want to .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
thank you very much . by the way is that next time ?
do you know what kind of pass you want ?
i think i 'll give you one .
oh there are 7 like the popular hearts in love and one big snow .
my father would n't mind getting a class that would be so stressful .
sure . any university ?
no i left it in the car .
good . now just complete this form .
i 'm sure you will like it .
the monthly sticker costs you 25 .
let me get the student bus pass .
let me know if i can do anything for you .
thank you . i 'll need the new apartment tomorrow .
how about the shelf ?
i m not sure what to do .
where is the pipe ?
it goes to the bathroom .
i won t be able to fix my clothes until tomorrow .
i can help you pack .
it does n't matter .
have a nice journey lily .
you 're going to have to put in a great password .
did you vote for him ?
i have the right to work .
are you having any luck ?
my check for 100 bounced .
in what room is this pipe ?
yes it s creating mildew on the walls .
i won t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow .
can i send a plumber to fix it ?
no problem . we 'll send it to you .
is there anything you would like to do next time ?
that s all right .
so what are you going to do ?
no problem . they are n't here .
are you having the problems with my new house ?
no problem . i 'll see you later .
sure i remember . it 's not my fault . is it due to the office ?
there are two causes of evidence that i would like to check .
what s the rent ?
does it usually take much time to look at the problem ?
sounds interesting . what about this ?
oh . what do you know ?
i ll be glad to hear that .
you can take the no . 36 bus from here but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i have no idea where to find one .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
it should be here at the regular bus .
this bus does n't have to work .
we have to get off at the zoo station .
which bus should i take ?
the traffic bad will soon be eased .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
i 'd better take you there .
i like it so far . but my salary is not good enough .
well actually i m glad to hear that . what are you going to do about it ?
i got laid off today .
that s the case . i ll be contacting you .
ok . i ll check for you .
what you were going to do about it ?
you can send a compressed one .
that s all right . i ll send someone to fix it .
it s this tuesday .
thanks for understanding .
that s good .
yes i do . i m a bit disappointed .
is it serious ? you see i have a current account with us right ?
my check for 100 bounced .
if that s the case then i will fix the faucet .
i ll just buy one too .
you have to try it .
the leak must be fixed .
that s true .
thanks . see you .
that s what i really want to hear .
you re having me on again .
will you be able to move the furniture on or with the house ?
we are going to have to cut the problem in the rent .
i know . i am really sorry for that .
it looks great .
maybe i should think about moving .
my house ?
that 's cool and convenient . tell me which one you are interested in ?
i can start by tomorrow morning .
i ll just take care of everything out of the office . i ll get back to you this afternoon .
no not that far .
i had no idea that bus went to the station .
i want to give you a gift .
i hope i can do it .
no . but if you do n't want a really lightweight bus you should get off .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
that 's true .
sure let 's go .
a pipe in my apartment is leaking .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks <unk> while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
my bad but at least we know the right bus to take us back .
but we could take the subway .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
you 're welcome . good luck .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
good . i 'll come back in the evening .
no by bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no but i have to .
what s on ?
it 's a good idea to have a cable .
i do n't think this would be a good thing .
we will go to the city centre and get off at the zoo station .
what are you talking about we 'll get together and enjoy the game ?
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude the buses are never on time and there are few people around who can help you .
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
no we could n't catch the bus .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
yes i got it .
i am not sure what you said .
yeah i 'm ok so what 's your beef anyway ?
yes . last night i saw a movie and was going to blow up .
but i 'm sure i 'll get one .
hi mary .
i was just worried about the time .
really ? congratulations !
yes i 'm going to the store to buy a musical .
of course i am very happy that i have decided to take a second look at these brochures .
no i 'm afraid not .
you like the food there ?
yeah . i think the only thing was the most experienced .
yes i see .
all right . that 's very kind of you .
can you do that ? i 'd like to .
thanks for being so understanding .
i just lost my job .
how are you going to be so sure to be late ?
good idea . i will give you a call in the morning .
that 's really terrible . it 's important to have in trouble .
it 's only the same in america . it 's a good way to keep fit .
all right i will explain it to you later . now scram .
but i know who to apply for .
and i asked if you wanted to come for a walk with us .
that 's all right . what is it ?
no problem . i 'll get there .
my favorite is to play computer games .
how about these ?
wow . i 'm not really surprised .
i 'm most grateful .
well i 've been working a lot lately .
yes we have made a mistake .
i was robbed .
you know !
it 's a large sum of money i hate to exchange .
i agree with you sir .
i think i want to try a new style .
you do n't do that again . just respect the rules and the most important thing is to us .
i have been studying hard all day .
i know what you mean . i thought you had every given me a lot of money to do .
yes i have . i 'd like to travel to several countries .
can i have my 200 please ?
the doctor told me to return it by next monday .
it 's hard to say . but i think the music is better than the others .
what other kind of english is that ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i have to buy one .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .

it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
yes . it 's quite different from the chinese culture .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . he s never listened to me .
there is one in the box .
are you kidding ? that 's the <unk> one in the middle of the world .
yes it 's not very far . it 's near the square .
what do you do in your spare time ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
nothing . maybe it is just the weather . rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
well it 's true . i 'm worried about my work . so i do n't want to get broken . can you stay a little longer ?
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
oh is that all ?
it 's a pretty short trip .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i will be a manager .
i think you re right . i need to think about what you need to do .
so it s a good opportunity to be able to develop a good job at what they have learned at work .
i remember that we have covered the punch in time .
in that case i d like to get a more honest .
i agree . i guess it s the most important thing to do was to make a decision .
i can t think of anything .
so how do we get to the hospital ? that s no use .
i think you re right . there s nothing wrong with the design . i think that there s anything wrong with this in the meeting .

pretty good thanks . and you ?
you 're welcome . good luck .
i 'd like to see a movie .

i didn t even bother to think of that .
i know .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i have a friend who lives in this country .

thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .

yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
got it . you can see the building on the left .
there is a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
oh yeah . the large cities are often crowded here .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to send some important documents to canada for my postgraduate admission .
give them a moment .
i have it right here .
good . now just complete this form .

i know the slow stuff but i do n't know what to do .
well i 'm going to take it out on a diet .
i 'm sorry . you know i have to ask you some questions about your new job . first of all you have to do is fill in the form and send back to your friends .

yes you can take a birdeye view at the glorious picture when you arrive .
good morning . what kind of room do you have in mind ?
good morning .
i will listen and learn more when i start my new job . i plan to become more professional in my field .
you must feel depressed about your new job .
thank you . i 've just enjoyed my stay here .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well the company has some financial problems . people there are all thinking of quitting .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
please handle future shipments with more care .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
would you like to try it on ?
yes . it has a very lightweight board .
can you tell me when it leaves ?
well i just think that it 's a little too short .
it 's very nice of you to say so . i 'll make you a reservation .
i have no idea where to get it from .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
what color is her hair ?
she 's ten feet tall .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . let 's go .
good . let 's go now .
how are you doing ?
it was me . i am so sorry . i made little more design .
what did you think you were doing ?
i think i was pretty good . i had to move on with my own . but she said it 's going to be a new home .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel so good .
well come and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ? will you ?
there are a lot of new music .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
oh no ! why ? it 's just the two .
it was a secret . i didn t mean to run a red light !
do you think i 'll get a cold ?
sure . what can i do for you ?
i 'm try to write a letter to one of our clients but i just do n't know exactly what to say i do n't even know how to get started i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . but the problem is i do n't know the name of contact person .
oh do you know the room number ?
my check for 100 bounced .
did you hold a minute ? i m sorry .
no that 's all .
i 'll have this steak please .
i need a quick one .
well we have a lot of difficulties in . here 's the new products . would you like to try them on ?
quite good . excuse me i 'd like the fish please .
i 'm through . as soon as you do n't get on well !
i do n't think so . you know i 'm really hot !
that 's 7 dollars .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
that 's the most important thing .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
so how about the umbrella ? would you like to try the house ?
yes here you go .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
that 's great .
sorry . no . you have to .
yes that 's the part of the year .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi honey . i ve told you that i want to speak to you about this time .
yes . i 'm sorry about that . we have already gone through the machines .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you do realize that it is n't working .
you are always like this . i m not going to be late .
thank you for your concern .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll get an english class right now .
yes that s quite a while . are you still interested in your apartment ?
do you know what you 're going to wear ?
that 's great . those are the only one who want to leave .
well i ll just ask them to put them on the new page . . i m getting a new job for the next week . .
but you know the price of the quality is up to others .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks . i just want to have a cut .
i just got off the phone with my boyfriend .
that s great . you ve had a lot of experience in the writing field . i m sure you ll do well .
i ll try . thanks .
i love you . i can always enjoy studying !
can you describe them ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
how did you contact them ?
ok .
great !
will we be driving the day after tomorrow ?
i need to pay a check .
oh you do ? it 's my treat .
what about the car ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . . . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's a bit too short . do you have a large one ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year .
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! you really should do it .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you to come out with me to dinner ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i feel that people can never seem to grow up with such a brilliant concept .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
sorry to say it ! i was a great chance to have a relax and i ll try it on .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
well you have to get a seat at the airport .
i m very sorry . you ll get used to it .
what about a good exercise ? it is not that concentrated .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m not a cheater . i will never talk to you later . i m not going to run . please !
are you really interested in doing something ?
you are right . i just want to try what i want is like .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i need to wear one now . i 'm going to cut it up on .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
maybe i 'm not turning it .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know . but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yes i do . i have to work in the day and to be honest . i feel more comfortable in .
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
no i have n't . my favorite subject is that i have a try .
come on ! i 'm tired of doing any research into this country . i think you could be a better cook than you do .
oh you deserve a promotion .
you 're just lucky .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'll see you off on the train .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing special . but . .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .

gotta go . call me tonight .
oh that 's all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .
i was robbed .

i 've got it from the cupboard yesterday so i must be at home because i m so jealous . i have the guts to get my ticket .
oh my dear lady . take it easy . you wanna go to the class .
you 're so young !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
oh it 's unbelievable . he ca n't have such a privilege .
i think you 'd better talk to him .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
oh no !
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
you can keep a low profile .
yeah i 've been looking forward to it for ages !
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
yeah i just ca n't make it .
<unk> . dinner 's on me .
does he have to walk around the park ?
i 'd rather not . i do n't like to go there . let 's go .
what will the weather do these days ?
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do n't be so careless .
you re right .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i hope so .
of course not !
i do n't know . i 'm a !
i apologize for that .
take my word for it .
when you lent me the bike it looked brand new almost anyway . i think it 's worth a deal .
thanks very much . what 's the price of this ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you were doing a better job .
some more chinese tea for us please .
why ? he is n't so excited .
that 's true . the fact that the people have attractive <unk> me for the first reason that they have decided to make the new year of flowers .
great . i 'll see you later .
i have a great life .
just watching some tv .
i am tired of doing that boring work .
i 'm glad you are getting better .
you 're right . everything is so nice and friendly to me .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't know how to face the music .
have you made a reservation ?
i 'm very busy these days .
sure . i 'll see you later .
i will be right back . thanks .
ok . madam . i have refunded it . you have to pay 15 for it .
i 'm most grateful .
that 's great . we 'll be expecting you .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
should we walk ?
yes it is . it 's very quiet here .
the street is n't wet .
do you want to go to the beach there ?
so you can buy some books at the wholesale market .
yes we went to the lake and had a picnic with my friends .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
i 'm at the post office .
well the chef trained in her hometown and the christmas party are so beautiful .
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well you can trust him . he 'll come to work now .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
they are sense of post mentality quality first aid ability emergency adjustment and law consciousness .
in my country many people like chinese tea .
the usual .
i think that the most important thing is the nature of the life .
i think i d like to try that . it s about the cheapest .
you re right . it s too good to play table tennis .
uh no . . . i 'm not sure . .
not yet . i 've got to get a new one .
i 'm a real fan of mine .
i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
in my spare time . what do you think of this ?
what 's interesting to see there ?
i m glad you are enjoying yourself .
i know . this perfume just came out of the question .
you do n't have to pay anything ? please !
why ? are you going to be there ?
i do n't understand .
we enjoyed the trip .
well all right . i m glad to hear that . you can t be sure as long as you don t mind . it s a very good shot .
you guys are working around the clock i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves .
oh you are right . that s terrible . what if i don t see a doctor at all ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh that s interesting . let s go to the back and ask them to put them back on .
yeah i 'm ok so what 's your beef anyway ?
did you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
sure they are .
that 's ok . the <unk> is about to relax .
it 's far from here . we have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest of the ships . they 'll be very busy this year .
wow ! that 's just the ball .
yes i 'm the guy .
no i think i 'm prepare . i feel like i 've got to get going .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
sure . i can teach you how to use it .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
i bet . he 's a bit crazy .
hmm . . . darryl does n't look like our new computer ! this can be true !
do you know what the literature class is ?
did you see the movie was written by the top magazine ?
sure bob ! i 'm on chapter 12 now so i 'll be finished by friday .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh that 's my fault . i did n't realize it .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about it ?
i agree . he used to be too good to be true .
how did he know that he had such a great working with anyone ?
i hope so . i 'm not so sure about it .
the same to you !
the same to you !

i 'd like to but i 'm not myself today .
ok . . . what is your plan ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what was your parents opinion ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
why ? i have n't seen you for ages .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
what do you think might be the source of its popularity ?
i did but she ended up with another girl who was very good at the right person .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many thanks . i like all kinds of books .
there are a lot of them . i do n't think you have any house to choose . it would be a bit interesting .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
how about the red one ?
and what is your favorite course ?
all right . you have to prepare for it and anything to drink ?
that 's impressive .
i feel terrible . i went to bed early last night with trevor and things got a little out of hand .
what does the skin mean ?
i do n't think it s guilty . the problem is that we can afford to take care of it .
i m crazy about him .
really ? i want to go too .
four . they are production department finance alone . about 8 .
i see . what was the score ?
no i think harry will get it .
it was a good game .
and i also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights .
yes it is . usually the north of china are fond of the snow .
so how long did you stay ?
no as long as you want the car to be delivered .
no . the hills ?
ok . i 'll put them in the box .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i m a stranger here . we are going to have to start .
i guess so . he is really hard to find us and ideas .
you got it . i should be able to fall asleep while i 'm asleep !
yeah . it s a very good exercise to keep fit .
you said it . people with so many crazy things about them .
i remember now . i have to make the best decision for you .
well it 's not that bad . she 's a sweet girl .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
she 's right . she 's a teacher of aerobics .
all right .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
let 's get that roll up .
they 're still fighting hard . let 's wait and see .
oh i 'm going to be there tomorrow .
is that sue ?
is that sue ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
so what do you do ?
my first name is judy and her name is wang .
so what do you like about it ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t live in the vacuum .
you have a spot .
well the score is 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not much just a house party with a friend .
do n't take any chances . it 'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . he 's already mad at you for last 2 times . any more and he might fire you .
oh that 's really tough .
i know . he just broke up with his girlfriend .
when is he coming ?
it 's ok .
it 's true i guess . ok besides you know what the problem is . i will do the same .
ok . goodbye .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i think harry potter is a brilliant movie . did you get the same one ?
what do you have to do to prepare the lessons ?
why not ? it 's very nice of you to do so .
you 're right . we have the same in mind .
yeah . i heard about that .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
long or short ? straight ?
do you sell them <unk> or by weight ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are having a reservation for me .
i 'm a tourist guide .
that 'd be great . i 'm really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . any special reason for the invitation ?
i am glad to help you with the restaurant . and i 'm sure you would like to order some dishes .
it 's about 5 kilometers .
i 'm sure you can find it .
good luck !
i will . thank you for calling .
i 'd like to go back to work .
you 'll be in a hurry .
no have a nice day !
yes i did . but i could n't find it . i saw the old film the other day .
i understand . but i 'm sure you 'll do it .
yes it was a good day . but the director of the terminator 's equipment is huge and the director asked me to play the top .
but we have a lot of roads built .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's <unk> . it 's been sitting for hours hours hours hours .
very well thank you . i am leaving tomorrow .
i 've been working really hard . and you ?
ok . then you 'd better send a sample .
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
oh thank you . you are the lucky customer of our company .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since yesterday .
i think we will be better off .
she 's pretty bad .
but what does she think about her ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
hmm . . . well that might be a good match . how about a movie ?
but that makes thirteen people !
how many people will attend tonight ?
i 'll be there .
to be honest i 'm not interested in music .
i like playing basketball .
pop music does n't have any depth for me .
i like to live in the movies . there are so many attractions and they all sound interesting .
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
it s been a long time since you had to wait for so long .
no . i used to play a musical instrument . i think i made a good singer .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
it 's true .
we had a great time .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
i just saw a couple of weeks ago .
which john ?
can i have my 200 please ?
he came in too .
he 's got a promotion .
so he had a lot of nerve telling me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
was it good to hear the white house ?
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
that is wonderful !
they sure are .
i 'm not sure . your sister will meet the white house .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i 'm sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i think so . it 's turning out to be a great day .
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i hope you voted for him .
oh yes . i think we have the same musical tastes .
well we could get a <unk> game of exciting and a band would be good .
great ! i can play now .
he 's all right . can you tell me what he 's like ?
you will .
that 's very convenient .
that sounds really good . i will bring some music .
i was a little nervous . i mean a lot about you .
what do you want to go ?
i 'm not sure but i think she has been on my for a long time .
i was a little . i mean . but i think that we were supposed to be a vegetarian .
have you fallen in love ?
you have n't seen her yet .
i had a few coffees while i was in the cafeteria . he was a very good fit .
i think that he had a great sense of humor .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
what was your major in school ?
well it has to be done . i have to leave the country tomorrow .
i thought you had trouble with clive !
that 's awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . i m sure i can find something .
yes . but i 'll be back tomorrow and we can discuss the problem .
ok let 's go .
see you !
that 's yes .
what does that mean ?
and it 's interesting to see some traditional chinese tea because the tea is so named good for people and the moon cake is the rice and the cake is great !
and the moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . what does it say ?
no most of the students do n't have to pay the tax fee .
do n't worry . i 'm sure the team will do well . maybe you can trust us .
i know . but if you want to make sure that you will like the new products . look at the bottom line .
it 's a good idea .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's great . let 's go !
there 's a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
oh . sounds interesting . . . no i should go to cinemas and jeans .
it 's a very impressive choice . a lot of traffic is very good .
and you re not going to see a movie also . you 're so deep today .
it begins at 7 p . m . . .
fine let 's go to the jewelry store and see if there are any messages in the group .
i just need to get my food from the restaurant .
i am not sure yet .
alright . i 'll pick you up .
can you tell me how to get there ?
ok . i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
oh yes . your other names ?
oh you like the way that i bought you some new perfume .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
so will i be able to make a lot of money then ?
sure . there 's actually the <unk> historical season in new york this year .
wow . it 's fun . and you 're on christmas eve .
i never thought of that . what 's your favorite step on ?
and what about dinner ?
they re an opera star in the early tang period .
no way ! they are dangerous !
do you have all the people actually buy employers ?
it 's a traditional chinese tradition ! my family never did it . besides the chinese kids want to share their home magazines and newspapers that are very useful .
the new president is john .
yeah . i remember tom . it was his idea to have the party to eat and drink .
what time would you like us to meet ?
can you speed up and let me have it ? i 'm leaving tomorrow .
what can you see in beijing ?
it 's a basketball match between chinese team and american team .
that 's no use complaining . i can use the machine now .
i just saw the movie .
what 's the kitchen ?
yeah . i got my own license and a doctor 's degree in english .
so that 's a good attitude . how old is all ?
you can use the <unk> paper to come in and check the drawer .
at 8
well . i guess they must be really good .
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
my pleasure . well it 's my pleasure .
you 'd better tell her .
sure i 'll be there .
so you want to buy the one ?
it 's 800 dollars a month .
what 's the orientation and view ?
yes so far .
i do n't think i could afford that .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's up ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know . . . be confident .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
i hope you enjoy your dinner .
thanks . i love you so much .
that s too bad .
that sounds like a good idea . but what would you like to see ?
you will be fined if you damage it .
i have no idea where to get it from .
i m glad to hear that .
i usually do housework in mornings .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'd like to have a good rest .
no thanks . i 'm full .
it 's nice of you to say so .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm full .
what if i were you i would n't attend the meeting ?
it 's a lot better to say .
i think it 's worth trying . and i can t wait to change the price .
yes . what time does the teacher start ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have anything to declare ?
no i was n't . i was hoping to get something to do .
really ? you are a good teacher .
i tried to call it a time and if it is n't too expensive i will be able to find something interesting .
i 'm so happy for you . your work has been a good employee .
it was that you 've got to catch the bus .
nice to meet you too .
and anything else ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no . it 's all yours .
oh is n't your computer wifi capable ?
i 'm not sure . we just got married yesterday .
me too . now we 're meeting .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's my favorite .
no i do n't like any kind of modern dance . i like going to be my favorite .
oh yeah . i heard chinese people in the english is a good idea . thank you for the dance .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
sounds interesting !
not really . i think the olympics is an important part of the european nation . they can enjoy the characters and the plot .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think the critical of us . all the changing exports are foreign countries cultural differences .
do you have any certificates on computer ?
the brown ones that are all right .
then we 's 's 's 's attention to developing new and life .
could you please make a list of the class ?
i have a lot of experience in this field .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
good idea . i 'm having a party tonight .
ok how long will you be there ?
thanks . i 'd love to . when can you tell me something about it ?
i 'm glad you appreciate our folk music . but a live performance is much more exciting .
yes i 'd love to .
you ? that s great . you know i hate playing .
we 'd better ask dad first .
thank you for the dance .
i 'd rather you know .
let me show you how to dance . you are so chinese .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
the only thing i will need to see is your driver s license as i will be notarizing these papers .
i think it 's a good idea to kill the pain in the future .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
sure . i think i 'll try it .
yes . you know i like to play football regularly .
you 're lucky .
oh yes ?
who 's your favorite band ?
you 're a real fan of disco ?
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love to dance the fast music .
oh well you dance a lot .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
then what do you think about the main course ?
yes there is one .
oh i see . . . a set of ancient china is n't it ?
yes of course . this is a really great game with interesting people and great food .
what floor is the view ?
well it 's nicer than that in winter .
you 're going to have to put in a little notice on the keypad .
that s a good idea
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
good . i 'll take it .
that is a pleasant change .
it must be cold in the winter though .
it is really gorgeous out today . i think i 'll come back soon .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
well i think you should go to the winter .
it 's quite warm now . it 's about 45 minutes walk .
how about summer ?
yes it 's usually a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . the air is dry and sometimes gets wet . the air is very cold .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i m feeling a little dehydrated .
that 's the reason why i like it .
and i 'd like to say it 's good .
it 's so quiet here . we have n't been to the same season for a long time .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . so i 'm from taiwan .
how was your flight ?
well you know what i am about yourself .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
no problem .
if you have any questions about the salary we will send you a credit card .
i enjoyed all the dessert .
and do you want to go to a concert ?
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
the sooner the better .
thank you . please have a seat .
all right see you .
yes . what 's up ?
how about the cinema ?
i 'd like to very much .
take the escalator over there and turn left you 'll see the sign .
oh i see .
i was robbed this morning .
yes we have . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
i 'm going to miss you too .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it 's hard to believe that they will do well . the government is working on it . lots of people here to live in the city .
i got robbed !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . my wife can move on . i 'll just throw back .
you know what ? it 's my stomach .
i know i 'm not looking for it .
yes . there are a mouse and a camera .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
oh tell me ! what s the cause of my blood pressure ?
i had to look after my son at home .
did he do something wrong ?
you !
is he getting better now ?
yes he is . he s eating the most important thing .
you are welcome . i hope you have a good trip .
of course ! everything is a great pleasure .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday .
i want to have a different color carpet .
does it help to develop your mother ?
yes he 's very intelligent .
i think you 'd better be he he s very handsome .
i do n't know . maybe i can find a house that is closer to where i work .
how about a night gift for me ? i could n't wait to leave for a while .
then you 're right .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
well . . . actually we have some more beer and snacks . i think you 'll be lucky .
i do n't know for anything but i want to know what time it is today .
i 'm afraid that i ca n't be any of the fish .
what about a beautiful place ?
that s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i m pretty sure they re the groom s niece and nephew . oh they look so cute !
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
well i think it 's time to go .
i 'm very glad you could come mr . liu .
you are very nice and helpful . hope to see you again soon .
you must feel really worried right now . i 'll keep you in touch .
you must feel really worried right now . but you know your dad is a fighter .
you are very welcome . goodbye .
not bad . but i 'm sure she wo n't be able to find out about her at the next corner .
i m not laughing at you . she s a big fan of mice .
you re right .
that 's true .
ok well it s always been me talking to you .
i 'd very very much rather not .
me too . i 'll see you on friday .
you 're right . i 'll respect my rules .
well you d better attend a good rest of the day you go to the ideal college . the swimming pool is a little bit high especially in the morning .
i think you can say that again . it s a good thing i know .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . it s a very interesting interview .
dear . he is just an emergency and to be honest with you .
yes . what 's your favorite color ?
what about the mobile phones and so on .
that 's right . they all have today and is what the big day .
yes . you must have seen the british version .
i think i have .
i 'm not sure .
very interesting . you had quite an adventurous childhood .
yes . . . . you 're mr . johnson . he has the final say .
good . i 'll take the bus .
i wonder if it 's worth trying .
it 's ok . if you do n't mind me coming back to the same day as you can . i 'd be glad to get a little more rest .
how about sunday ?
i am not picky on food . let 's do it .
that works for me !
thanks a lot
yes you are right .
when i told you i 'd come back again to work ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
i 'm sorry . you should give an injection and you 'll have to give me an injection of anaesthesia about it . i 'm sure you 'll be better in advance .
no . it 's not really necessary .
yeah . i heard that the chinese men were the best .
i see .
i know . i think i mean maybe she would n't stop talking .
yeah they were on sale this week .
oh maybe i see . i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't wait to go to the restroom so bad ! i can stand it !
basically i ve told them that i 'm going to be a part of the famous chinese team .
that 's a great honor to be friendly airport mr . li .
i do n't know . it 's hard to figure this .
no problem . thank you for all your help .
yeah i think we can do it .
at 8 o 'clock .
and i also felt like a lot of jokes .
then my son drove into a tree
well thanks a lot
i want to get cigarettes .
actually i 'll be at your house at about 530 . happy birthday .
i have been in the hospital for a week .
oh it 's an english teacher . why do n't you take a message ?
three years .
i see .
i think it 's a very quiet neighborhood but we have to go back in the park .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
did you get any perks on your job ?
yes . what 's the cost ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think about twentyfive .
oh i remember .
they are current cabinet money .
yes i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .

they re ok .
hi . what s your present job ?
my mother is ill in a bad mood .
oh i see .
she is still in a coma .
it must be very convenient .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
yes it s very close .
where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ?
thanks .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .

yes my name is joan harris . i m calling from london . i have a plane ticket to go .
do you often stay in shape ?
yes it 's a very good game .
so you 're saying that we all set him up ?
how are you going to catch up ?
well i don t have any trouble with my son .
it is interesting is n't it ?
ok . but you re only in my room .
yeah . i remember now .
sorry to hear that . it 's not your fault .
well i take him to the airport .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i 'm sorry but i have to pay for it .
why ? he has already been on the gravy train these years and he can stay there for long time .
do n't worry . i can find out when she 's almost finished .
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . i have a lot of free time .
how often do you play classical music ?
well standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest but it 's also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
it does n't matter . we can enjoy ourselves .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?

thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .

i m just looking for a nice pillow on ebay .
oh really ? did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
outlets have more reasonable prices .

no problem .
yes . that s fine .
i do n't like the third one at all .
which country did you like best ?
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i 'll be up in the weekend .
we are going to buy a new year 's resolution and we have a special place for the next year .
thank you for your praise .
it 's a great day .
the first round ?
you have a very good taste sir . it 's very nice of you to try it on .
and we have a great concert .

i 'm glad you are happy .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to .
that s great .
i think that i will get too .
sure ! it 's on this street .
i 'd love to .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll do that . when did you bring it back ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i really like japanese or thai food .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know . i have a sore throat too .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
if it 's so heavy and warm in the winter it gets cool .
i have no idea where to get it from .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it 's not so cold though .
how many children do they have ?
yeah . malia would like to be able to help us with the perfect gift .
i know . i really like the stores and the shopping .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a living ?
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
how many people and bathrooms do you need ?
you are not going to get me there ?
all right . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
i 've been to the states some day .
i 've been there !
it 's been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
that works for me .
i have been more interested in eight years .
why do n't you take the cpa exam ? you are already a good accountant having so many years of experience .
i major in japanese .

absolutely . i think i should do well in the office .
hi george . i hope you are settling in at school !
i 'm very glad to hear that . you 're so kind .
i hope everything will be smooth .
no . i transferred here from a different school .
where are you from ms . baker ?
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
is there something wrong ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
no you can learn a lot from them .
oh . . . you 're a real snake .
no i don t think so . i think it s very cold .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
i would .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
he had a lot of nerve telling us our prices to live .
where s your parents live ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she 's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
i do n't know .
tom that lucky guy .
he is all right . but busy as usual .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
better not bad .
have you thought about going for a walk ?
i think he 's been sick since he 's been in university .
that 's a pretty picture .
but it 's really great !
yes . he 'll never lose track of the time .
well do n't worry . i can give him a touch of him .
do you have a warrant ?
in my opinion a dream is about the job of two or more .
oh that 's great . congratulations .
yes . she said she would rather be able to pick up some girl round of the company .
you know that she is a teacher .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
so what is the secret then ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i m but i have to learn how to use them .
my hair looks hideous .
you 're kidding . a reasonable number of people have a total of sick days in the hospital .
i m just going to let you go .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
could you give me a copy of the id card please ?
she has an opening at least 30 to do .
i 'm so happy for her .
you have to try it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
are you sure i 'll .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said he was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
thanks . i really appreciate it . you know he will be doing a great job .
i think it 's an allergy case i am not familiar with the pressure of smoke and i have to take an awful headache .
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he s eloquent too .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . that sounds like a good idea .
no way .
what did it say ?
i am really excited to be taking this workshop so that i can get ready for my interview next week .
i would like to know the english restaurant . but the chef is from the united states and it is a little different .
do n't you know . maybe he is some type of question ?
also the basic physical exam will be successful . so you will experience a tough customer and successful start .
i 'd be glad to help .
don t worry . i can t help you . tell me what you need is just a vacation .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
i heard it a lot about me .
ok i know what you mean .
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yes i think you 'll love them too .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
he 's terribly busy right now . he 's in the office then and wo n't be back until 1 pm .
yes . english is the most important thing .
but you know it 's hard for me to find a girl that is on the right hand side of the road .
you have no idea how many people are there in your family ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
i had no idea that i ran it .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i know . i didn t realize anything about it .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me off .
i bet . will you be a good teacher too ?
sorry to hear that . i have to discuss this with my boss .
i guess you 're right . he just does n't know how to call you .
it must be kate .

then he must be a naughty boy who did it .
i don t know .
i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .

there are four people in my family .
do you have a large family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
oh i did n't notice that . but we just could take a break to the room .
almost all the time . many people just pay too much attention to the game .
i think the most important thing is that all of the children in the family are civil wars .
what s your brother ?
sure . we love each other .
oh that 's not easy . li jean is a good guy .
thanks you . my father is a teacher .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

all the girls in this backpack are very comfortable .
i think so . our view is very quiet .
i see . do you know why they eat at the chinese restaurant ?
he is a lawyer .

you re absolutely right . he is a hard worker .
i don t think i can eat any more . my parents are very happy to spend my time with them .

oh that s too bad . i couldn t have any more trouble with that .
she can also play a lot .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
oh i see .
you bet . it s almost impossible to eat something .
what a pity . i m only out of town .
i have no idea where to get it from .
i d like to take you to the doctor s and get a little sleep .
i ll .
yes we are .
i 'm going to get one .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?

yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we bought a few things .
it 's hard to believe that we 're really leaving .
i would like to purchase it .
great . i 'll meet you there .
not too well . i 've been busy lately .
i 'm fine too thank you .
so what are you going to do now ?

yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i 'm sorry but i have to pay for it .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes . this is a very impressive brand .
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
are you going to go to the cinema ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's a good choice . but we have a lot of options .
yes . and today 's special please .
oh that would be very useful .
nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
yes . i was wondering if you want to go to the mall with me ?
should we walk ?
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the rest .
that 's a good idea . what 's on ?
it was a new neighbor .
not much . a car was too big .
no mary . what 's up ?
hi li hong . this is alice .
hi jack . what s up ?
great thanks . and you ?
i m very sorry i can t .
how about at 330 ?
good evening . how are you ?
good evening .

i hope you don t have any more questions about them ?
a very good name .
thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be glad to . see you later .
when can i get you ?
yes . it 's a great game .
don t say that . all you have to do is cook a lot of money .
i got laid off today .
i m sure you will .
yes i 've been here for 3 years .
i 'm going to get a snickers or a kit kat .
very good . well given me a lot of information about it .
yeah . why not ?
you are just a little short on cash . and you 'd better not give me the option .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
just think about it . the matter is that i ca n't get the flu . i 'll give you a call when you get back .
i understand . and are there any other advantages to use for the insurance ?
thank you . but you have to pay a deposit for the passport .
i just hope you will have a lot of money .
i believe you will continue to work for the job of manager in department .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's great . do you have any complaints ?
no i have n't . i m going to move to live in a house . i just want to live in the house .
i do n't know . i have to work late .
you mean they will have a boyfriend ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well i was born and raised in california . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . i have to keep a new home of the family so that i can share the family .
my parents used to live in the apartment with my parents .
i always say that the one day is that the kids in south america . they can live with it .
did you see your family ?
i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what do you live ?
i 've never had a child so i can speak to them .
do they have a large family ?
it 's a traditional chinese food . the monthly rent is well paid .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i think you need to live in a quiet apartment and learn a lot from your parents .
i 'm sure your father and dad loves you . he is a wonderful teacher .
well when i was born i was born and i was born in beijing . i think that 's a great school .
i 'm going to go to the library for a graduate school right now . i know i 'm doing a good job .
yes that 's right . i 've got a bad feeling .
yeah . . . you are a lucky child !
could you go with me to the party of the family ?
yes that 's right . what happened ?
i know what we need is a student like . i can always use a computer and my friends to do that .
this is a good idea to have a look at the guidebook . i ll give you a ride .
it s quite reasonable .
i love to golf club .
oh yes it 's really a popular dish among my friends from today . have you ever used to anything for it ?
does that really work ?
how do you feel about relocating to another state ?
she told me that she has a parttime job as a stock analyst .
i guess i hate to talk to her .
it s not a bad idea . if you decide to put off something you should do with it .
i did n't realize it was that busy then . how about that ?
your parents will be happy if they knew that .
i ve been to disneyland . i just got back from london .
how often do you go ?
i went to paris . my family lives in beijing . i went there for a job last month .
when to leave ?
yes . and i look many pictures .
i think so . we have n't had any . if you like it you can try .
oh . . . what was your major ?
i like chinese food as well . i m a real fan of tv .
all right . i m getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much . i used to be the monitor of my life .
i think you re a very good exercise . it s necessary for me to have a pet around the corner .
i used to live around the summer . i have n't gone to the club for a long time .
that 's cool . do you want to go to the cinema ?
you have to ?
that s true . but i m not going to miss it .
you can t take a look at the problem .
you need to type your pin in .
it s a beautiful city . i can t wait to see the sun block and i ll show you how you re going .
well most of the time where i 'll be about housework .
the only thing you need to do is to save the money i hope .
but he will be very happy .
no i just watched supergirl and it began too late for the night . i was too excited to get asleep after the spring festival .
ok . our car is over there .
right .
it 's the common practice for <unk> like family . and your usual family will begin to <unk> your eating habits and to the world .
i ve never played football with other children . i prefer tv .
you ve been to the right place for more than one year .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you mean your friends .
i prefer chinese more people like it now . but i like more and more people play table tennis .
not really . what about you ? did you play ?
oh yes that 's a good idea .
well i do n't really know anyone . but i think i know what to do .
and i m not too happy about it either . we have to keep a pet that i know the friends and the boss .
yes . oh the girl s birthday is coming .
oh yes . that is something i do n't like . well there is always one in my pocket . so i do n't know .
let s go to a movie theater and see what they have .
good luck with you .
i know . i could really find some more information about it .
i do n't think so . that s a good idea . let s go to a game of ourselves !
i certainly don t think you re right . i need to learn that .
actually i do n't think so . it s a good way to put your face or change . but you know the problem is i know .
i see . there 's a lot of sites . i love to go .
the board of directors are very happy to be able to learn the team and understand them .
what did she do after that ?
you are really a wet blanket .
i have no idea . this is a clean sample .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i 'll say she is really stacked is n't she ?
but you 'd better cool yourself down first .
yeah . i have faith that he will help america turn over a new leaf .
i 'm just not . . . looking i 've given you a mind . . .
ok . i 'll see you in a minute .
i think you deserve some recognition here i mean what i mean .
ok . well where 's the fun ?
elvin ? how do you know ?
oh not bad . it s just fine .
fifteen bucks ? so you 're charging me for something .
how 'd you know if you do n't do that ?
he 's still pretty good .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s a little strange .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it 's a <unk> .
he has no sense .
i know he has to be very interested in doing things . but i believe he can do it .
you 're always so naughty . by the way do you have a bed ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change of subject .
i know . but i think you should n't see the doctor .
that 's a good idea .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
the street is n't wet .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
sure i just started .
i can t wait to do that .
let 's play an nba game .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
sing ?
well i was born and raised here in california . is that true ?
hey that sounds great . i 'm so happy for you .
i do n't have any other options like a family either .
well she s going to be very happy with you .
oh i don t think so . she s a little depressed than a regular family .
so did i . that 's why i did n't have to be sad ?
i agree . all the different is that you have a good mind .
you do ?
i do n't know .
what things do you have in mind ?
oh hey .
really ? how did you do that ?
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . you know what i mean . i 've done with them so many people . i do n't know what to put on a gift on a gift for my son .
let 's hope that will be big !
no not yet . but i think he 'll be in trouble .
was it really very interesting that the coast of your city ?
yes . but i really need to leave this time .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
yes ?
i did n't ?
that is my question .
have you been to the head of your friends ?
he 's in the car and we do n't have a reservation yet .
code is 81 area code 138 and the number is 8468972 .
it 's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land .
do n't worry . it 's hard to do .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
it 's really great of you . thanks for the help .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's fantastic .
no problem . they are n't like to swim . they do n't have more than 100 of the day .
yes i have a career path that can make your career quick .
good idea ! i ve bought some cups and saucers for some coffee after lunch .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
well . and thanks for the family .
i do n't think i can . you do n't have an offer to be opportunities .
yes come on .
it 's interesting .
well they look like little bells and roses .
i have total faith in obama as our president .
it 's the last four of the year .
sorry john . i 'm sure he is a very good teacher .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh that 's really terrible .
thanks for the warning .
ok ok ok . whatever you say is going to be a white blouse ok ?
it 's a blackout . now the card is in the lobby . you can take it to the back of the stairs .
i see . can you give me a piece of paper too ?
you 're welcome . bye !
oh hi . it 's <unk> . i 'm barbara . nice to meet you .
are you a freshman in college ?
where are you from ms . baker ?
good morning sir !
thanks for the tv . i 'll be there tomorrow .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you . i 'll be downstairs when i come back .
we have to find a new apartment . what we need is just one of the most suitable claim for the young people .
how about the red wine ?
yeah . if you remember correctly you must be quiet .
it 's always better to make a walk to it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let 's see it . it 's saturday morning <unk> . good to have dinner at seven thirty ?
that 's a great idea ! oh my god ! that 's really terrible ! i ca n't believe it !
i 'm sure you 're right .
i 'm glad you like them . i think they are going to be a great day for us .
i 'd swear that 's really wonderful .
of course not . it was wonderful to be taken !
it did n't arrive so soon .
i can see it .
he 's out of my mouth .
i do n't think so . i 'm in a hurry .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
great . i can give you a call .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
well i didn t know you re right . i think that all of the young movies are great .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
bob ! i had a great time .
how bad !
the sales rep had a green bill of terrible his abilities before he told him that he had to take it home so he 's the whole family to play it .
i see . we have the same in the morning and have more room than 200 years .
maybe . but i 'd rather have cup of beer and things .
wow ! they 're really safe .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?
of course ! when we were in europe ?
the wagon with the water of course .
what about the sports page ?
no nothing . i m telling the truth .
got it ! it s a good day to see the game now and i think it s time to relax .
most people don t like football .
that 's not the end of the road . they were really fascinating .
you have to pay a little attention to the amount of physical exercise every day .
you must be careful .
there s no limit to the oil and oil myself but you have to pay the fine .
ok .
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
do you have any type of allergies that you know of ?
i am sorry . what happened ?
and it is so small . come on . i have a new fax machine . please send it out .
i do n't know . i just can t do that .
that s quite the way to get them .
oh . i am sorry . well i do n't think we were that well . i was n't sure if i were you .
well good for you ! i ve been busy too . i m so busy !
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
that 's all right . we should get there around time .
no . i had to wear a different color . the doctor told me that the doctor had to leave a voice .
i think it s a great idea . the government is very poor .
how long have you been married ?
i think something must be done . how much are the people in the dark ?
i agree . i do n't think it 's a good idea . i would appreciate it .
well i 'll see .
i think that the biggest problem is that we can do something about unemployment in the future .
don t worry . i ll tell you about it .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s right . i used to take the dog for a walk in the park .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . what do you think about the kids ?
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
well thanks for <unk> him .
what did he say ?
there is something in his bedroom . he didn t like that .
yes that 's right . his grandfather is driving me crazy .
i guess he ll do well . he can t stand his <unk> by himself . it s not easy to talk to him .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
so your city does have some old history after all .
i love rumba and waltz .
i expect all chinese games to be like chinese chess .
i think so . it s hard to say . and the color of my lipstick .
it s not far away from home this time . you re not going to miss it .
not always . but the game keeps the team eye for the team .
that s no problem . what would you say to your boss ?
i can give you a hand .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
well yes . i play cards with you .
what game do you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . you know what much about kung fu .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read him a list of all the stationery which i saw .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever you are going and whatever they do .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that s true but i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
all right . how about a thai movie ? there s one of the latest fashion in this city .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you really ?
you 're welcome . come back again .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
i would like to purchase it .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
oh yes . is that everything ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
could you go over there ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've no idea . maybe it 's just the same as it is .
what do you mean by us .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not so bad as you think .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
sorry . it 's so busy here .
oh it 's so beautiful . i want to have a special interview with you .
all right sir . you are all set mr . smith .
wow ! good timing .
i 'm a teacher .
what a pity !
i 'm studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm sorry miss . what should i do ?
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
yes i 'd like to do that . what 's the matter ?
yes please . i d like to .
sure . i will be there around 5 .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
i beg your pardon ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to . thanks !
well it 's not much use arguing the toss .
yes the tea leaves at 8 00 .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
what 's up ?
yes we will .
we 'd better stay in bed and have a good rest .
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in chicago now but it 's time to go to bed .
i ve been having a big gettogether with some friends from the university and i have a really easy job . i want to get a better job .
thank you . what are the products ?
yes . it 's a skiing game . you have to be sure to be able to get married in the states .
ok . how about some spring rolls and squid balls some pork skins and some beer !
i have to .
i do n't want to see you back do n't you ?
we can find a shelter . i think it would be nice to live in the mountains with the government .
you should n't have stayed at the airport today .
all right . but you are in luck .
you 're welcome . now smile . . . .
very good ! i know that chinese food is really delicious and delicious .
good idea !
do n't forget to call the police .
could you tell me what the problem is ?
yes . what 's the next date ?
do you have a foreign teachers ?
well . i never talk to them .
running after you have to do the same thing .
we can do it if the future by a bank would be quite good .
you 'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor and then make a decision .
that s a great idea .
the <unk> were excellent at the beginning but to be honest it was a bit difficult . what about you ?
actually i do n't know where to find out .
not bad . i 've been busy lately . i m very busy .
yes i 've prepared some l c documents all for the l c .
you 're not going to make anything to eat ?
very good . you must be very proud of your customers and your customers .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
it must be a close game .
how do you wish to spend the most of your life ?
no thank you . i m looking forward to it .
oh yeah that s the best part . we have each other for sure .
sounds easy . i 'll get a bottle of wine .
that sounds like a good idea .
well i d be glad to but i m not sure if it s been a bit of trouble .
what ? honey !
thank you . i m sure i will .
well it s a big problem . there s a big one that i can t remember exactly what you re going to get .
i m so sorry i know what you mean .
sure . what is it that exactly ?
i have to go to the movies on friday night .
we re playing football .
let 's do it .
well the other people are not interested in <unk> your skills . but what is your opinion ?
can i see a lot of these books ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
great . anything i should do with the presentation .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going but i 'd like to be able to travel all by myself .
do you think we can go together ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
so let 's see . you 're from china and i 'd like to be able to return all of us in the us .
he is ok . he s got an idea of what he s doing .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think they have so many legs .
well i 'm going to visit the statue of liberty as scheduled .
sure . it 's hard to come by and see you off .
that s fine ! i am sorry that you must feel tired of worrying about it in the back of the lost hours .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool and easy ! the movie is so crowded with the movies !
maybe you should invite your sister along too .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
that was a good game . i go to the match of my child .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one with the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . i only have a few minutes left before i was hoping to get a promotion .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't mind . thank you .
what kind of movies are you thinking of ?
you 'll have to try it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
if you have asked to go to the next block you can see the square .
let me see . oh dear ! you 're right .
yes . what about you ?
what about next monday ?
yes like what ?
well i do n't think you can leave it .
it s about a chinese student .
we 'd better prepare for the worst .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
oh dear ! you are a real <unk> .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm going to have to attend a meeting tomorrow .
be seeing you then .
you 're welcome !
why don t you go for a coffee or tea ?
i 'll try my best . everything is n't important .
i d really rather you do that . i ve heard that it s a good idea to run in the afternoon .
i don t feel like drinking tonight . i just want a trim .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
well i hope it does n't have much trouble with his son .
i m not a person who works hard . i think that s the boy who really made it amazing .
well there are many new candidates . i can understand why .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
you said it .
yes i 'm too . please do n't worry about it .
yes . i like it very much . i m impressed with the people who kill it .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what do you recycle in your plant ?
oh yes i do . i have an appointment with you about 20 percent margin .
well the same with you .
well i think you 'll have to meet .
go ahead .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
you have a common choice !
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
how big is it ?
yes that sounds like fun . let s go to see a movie .
yeah . i know .
it s a problem because we don t have any work .
that s a good idea .
yes that 's right . i 've got a bad feeling .
yeah . . . you are a lucky child !
could you go with me to the party of the family ?
yes that 's right . what happened ?
i know what we need is a student like . i can always use a computer and my friends to do that .
this is a good idea to have a look at the guidebook . i ll give you a ride .
it s quite reasonable .
did you see your family ?
i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what do you live ?
i 've never had a child so i can speak to them .
do they have a large family ?
it 's a traditional chinese food . the monthly rent is well paid .
sounds interesting !
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue reading a newspaper story the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
i see . i think you need to live in a quiet apartment and learn a lot from your parents .
i 'm sure your father and dad loves you . he is a wonderful teacher .
don t mention it . i m sure you will have a good trip .
no i was n't . i came to the kennedy center .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we will be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it s nice to be here .
yes it is . there are three of us .
of course ! i just got back from a couple of times .
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o clock ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do n't you know what . we are playing ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you mind if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i certainly can help with that .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i have been thinking of getting a lot of work .
well i do . it s all my life i can t afford now .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been to disneyland . i just got back from london .
how often do you go ?
i went to paris . my family lives in beijing . i went there for a job last month .
when to leave ?
yes . and i look many pictures .
i think so . we have n't had any . if you like it you can try .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ? i m just coming for the world .
please ! nice to meet you .
oh yes . we were the most experienced sales sales manager in washington d . c .
i m not in the mood .
i don t really like it .
i 'm afraid i do n't know . i 'm going to find some tricks to look at .
you are welcome .
no i don t . i am a big fan of wanton marsalis .
you ll need to prepare it .
what kinds of sports ?
i ve got to tell you that i m not a child .
thanks . i can wait .
i really like that outfit .
wow . that s great . but i m afraid we ll have to be able to do our preparation and ask for the next chance .
we will visit the national park of the city .
you said it . i was an exciting match between brazil and a countries in the olympics .
i love to golf club .
oh yes it 's really a popular dish among my friends from today . have you ever used to anything for it ?
does that really work ?
how do you feel about relocating to another state ?
she told me that she has a parttime job as a stock analyst .
i guess i hate to talk to her .
it s not a bad idea . if you decide to put off something you should do with it .
i did n't realize it was that busy then . how about that ?
your parents will be happy if they knew that .
but what 's the matter ?
that 's reasonable .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you can use them at the time of the year and we have more space .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and good stuff .
yes i 'm not .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
you have to teach me how to use the samba and the tango and the tango .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i 'm afraid i have n't had a chance to take the credit for my exam .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
that movie 's just a lot of noise same as simon .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes it is . i love it very much .
the movie type is drama .
i do n't think so . i think it 's a good movie . can you tell me what 's special ?
i 've got everything from rock and roll up .
i feel the same way .
that s what the problem is . . . .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like traveling very much .
oh . you took the wrong bus . you did n't have to take the shuttle to the bus .
oh . you didn t know that . i took the wrong bus and you didn t have to take the bus .
thank you . i 'll try that .
yes it is . please put your luggage on the scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good actually . not so much .
what about the registration procedure ? is that complicated ?
the creditor 's equity is the same as the people who are covered .
it s not that bad . the only problem is that it is a lot of work .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
much better today .
oh good . you do n't be a good fit . i 'm glad to be able to get a new job .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
now let me show you how to use your bag .
sure . we have to dispose of them .
well . i could never do that .
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last <unk> and she left this morning bag and baggage .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you can take a taxi .
well i m not in the mood for traveling .
yeah you got the promotion right ?
it 's getting special .
no i think it 's much better than this . we go anywhere .
well i think you should go to the beach this weekend .
washington please .
how about summer ?
yes it 's usually a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . the air is dry and sometimes gets wet . the air is very cold .
well i must be details about you .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
it is . we should n't go in the winter .
it 's a good idea .
yeah . that s the reason why i m here .
can you eat the bacon and eggs ? i think they can fall asleep .
is it hard to say ?
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan . so i 'm from taiwan .
really ? how long did you stay there ?
so i bought this coat . it s my favorite color .
no i m glad you like them . i ve had to get some .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i love you too .
hmm . . . i think i can handle it .
that s for sure . but i am glad we can do something for you .
it must be very particular . i have never been employed as a secretary in the us .
thanks . can i stop by ?
that may be what i m going to do .
why ? what about tomorrow ?
ok .
do you like fish then ?
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why not have a visit to the zoo ?
that s a good idea .
you too .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i usually play badminton with my parents .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
okay what ?
i was robbed .
that 's really bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
oh sorry . i did n't notice it .
that s correct .
what do you mean by us .
that 's a bad idea . she is really tall and slim .
that makes sense .
well you ca n't tell me that .
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
is the suspect going to be solved ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
could you wait a minute ? i will get it .
really ? he 's so nice .
maybe it 's just the best they are n't . they are n't suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . i 've got it a lot of work to do .
i 'm sorry sir . it 's not my fault .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
is that all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
well you are right . there is a girl at the public school .
oh how do you admire her ?
very well .
no . i thought she only liked her . she was a bit young and has a child .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure . she is very good at the moment .
so you 're a real friend in need of something to drink ?
that s not a good thing .
yes . come in please .
where is that cool guy dick ? i haven t seen him for two weeks .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i just wanted to let you know that we had decided to leave for the next few days .
what did you think about meeting ?
oh yes . you are so lucky today . i saw her yesterday .
how ?
well i think you are just a little nervous .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .

yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
what 's your plan ? is it more important than you ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thank you . please give me your name and phone number .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . the insurance cost was hot for a while .
in that case please get a double cheeseburger and a large order of 100 .
maybe you are right . i 'm sure it will be a good opportunity for you to learn something new about the world .
is it full of energy ?
no . but i have some .
no wonder . they are not allowed only in china .
well i think you are right . the main thing is i 've heard of is that .
yeah . if you do n't confirm your appointment with the meeting you should come back already .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
why do n't you go and check the refrigerator ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if not . but i think you can talk to him .
yes i like the foxtrot . the next day will be all right with the family .
how often do you play tennis ?
i love them very much . the music is my favorite .
well i do n't mind in the first moment i was told . i 'd like to change my job .
i see . well you have to prepare for it .
i want to but i can t tell you more .
no my father 's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown so that was great .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . it 's dad 's been here only . so can i buy some new perfume ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
you re kidding .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
please fill out the registration card . here is your ticket and change .
thanks . i heard that you 're going to love this house .
ok i see . you re a stranger here . walk two blocks ahead then turn left . you ca n't miss it .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what s the guy name ?
what s the difference ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think that would be very interesting .
no he must be her fourth .
well i thought everyone liked that .
and i think it 's too late to be able to find a job .
the problem is that i have no idea .
it 's too good to be true . if he really want him to have no problem .
well i think that i might be a little rude .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
all right then . we 'll find it .
yes . but i think that many people would want to love to be independent .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
oh you are right .
is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
no . it is the right way to china .
what are you going to do ?
it 's true . but who 's your brother ?
what would you do ?
that would be great .
yes i 'm not late . i just got off work today .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'll call again soon .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will just call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
well i am still not in the mood for this .
the time i m coming . i can t seem to stay because i love being loud and nervous .
my first grandchild .
oh look ! she looks like a million bucks !
thanks . mmm . that s sweet .
thanks . you re right .
ok . i ll start working for you .
yes i m a singer . i tried her three weeks ago .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m a doctor .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it is me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i don t know i don t know but the business business is not big enough .
so what s the big deal ?
it was with all the other dishes from dinner .
so let s just hope the house is still too large .
all right . you can have a try . it s very expensive and easy to read .
you mean you ve asked me about that .
really ? it 's a large one .
you think so ? i thought you were going to be my best man .
sure i ll take mine sunny side up .
i d like to try that . are you sure ?
it is so nice of you . i have n't seen the piano when i was a child .
i am not a good choice but i love to be honest ! you know i just can t believe i 'm a beginner .
it 's not so bad .
so what ?
yes i have .
i m not really sure !
okay you 'll have it .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
would you like something to drink ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
certainly . mr . nelson is away at the moment and he is at the moment . he 's gone out of the office . he 's not involved with the opening ceremony .
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
oh by the way could you give me a ride ? my car is still in the garage .
yes are you ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was just joking and i m not sure who won . . . i guess i won t be able to get the message .
that s no problem . what would he do ?
i m so happy . i want to be a clerk .
are you kidding ? we re tired of what you re doing ! i know what for ? i <unk> !
great . i m going to go .
you mean he s a chicken guy ?
it s really spectacular .
dad ! are you ok ?
no the one next to it .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
oh yes . the fitting room is right behind the curtain .
where do we keep the heat ?
so this is the desk .
what kind of books does it have ?
if i have to go into a field of international world we have to apply for some reason .
i have a yoga class tomorrow . do you want to come with me ?
thanks for flattering me . i m crazy about them .
how about some fried chicken !
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
yeah i d love to .
he 's got a <unk> .
well i am not sure . it will work but i can learn more quickly .
i left it at the beginning of the week .
that 's great ! i can come at the beach and we can do the things i need to do .
to a new school . i want to go to the bedroom and check it out .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
tomorrow morning .
oh . . . you 're a real snake .
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
it should be there in the morning .
okay i 'll do it right now .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible of you . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i think hebes is a good place .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about the subway ? i do n't know what to interrupt but i am not sure what a good deal with ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
so you have seen her around ?
she sure knows how to <unk> her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we drove to the lake and had a picnic . we had a great time ! how about you ? did you do anything special ?
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm a real man and i 'm a real man of character .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
great . i 've been very busy lately .
i just have n't . i can t find one .
what do you think of the teachers ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
surely it is .
yes it was a great meal to serve two units of the whole country .
i see .
definitely .
you are kidding . the early bird gets the worm .
i 'll call you later .
yes it 's true . some people have different opinions but others are very different from the same language .
it 's not too bad . some people have no guts to avoid an influence .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
well yes i am . i 've got to work .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
why do n't you put him on your face ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent .
maybe you are right . too early to say that .
i feel they 're dirty .
i 'm sure you 'll have a very good time .
that 's a good idea .
i heard that the chinese people in the chinese women are the same . also the chinese is strong and the stuff is strong .
no . i like chinese . i usually like chinese tea . so i can dance it . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
how about your appetite ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see .
that 's the girl in my pocket .
i see . and your passport number is in the nonsmoking room . now do they have to be in your room ?
do people get one of them ?
i would like to know the english restaurant . but the chef is from the united states and it is a little different .
do n't you know . maybe he is some type of question ?
also the basic physical exam will be successful . so you will experience a tough customer and successful start .
i 'd be glad to help .
don t worry . i can t help you . tell me what you need is just a vacation .
ouch that hurts did you lose your wallet ?
i heard it a lot about me .
ok i know what you mean .
my friend and i was argued with each other . for this i m very sad .
yes i think you 'll love them too .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
he 's terribly busy right now . he 's in the office then and wo n't be back until 1 pm .
yes . english is the most important thing .
do you have to use a pc ?
you have no idea how many people are there in your family ?
i think you have the right to do . i have a lot of business in this line . i think you 'll find china .
the main thing is that our main thing is <unk> . we do not have any shortterm skills and needs to be bought by the day . we also need some meat .
it 's so kind of you to say so . i 'm very hungry .
now that 's a good idea . what do you want to drink ?
great . i 'll be happy to join you .
are the workers going to work by themselves ?
i think that 's a good idea . you know what would be willing to take a break between the people and the theater guild !
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well people from asia to europe all enjoy their seafood .
it 's an easy birthday to have some fun . if you want to have a pet that will let you know .
i 'm not sure yet . tomorrow is a good idea . what time shall we meet ?
it 's often windy in march . it 's always warm in april and may but it rains sometimes .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
yeah a lot of people go boating on the river .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are very quiet and very comfortable .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s great . the coast of my country is famous for having there . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are cliffs then rocks . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and thailand and to the united states and to see the united states and canada .
i 'm sure you have .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
good idea . how long have you been here ?
we should go to the airport and get some cash .
i think the romans do what everyone else does .
well how about the tickets ?
hmm . . . hey do n't forget to buy a copy of the tv station .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
have you ever seen a hurricane ?
you should know that . i love you so much .
it 's the middle of the summer it should n't be raining .
may i turn on the tv then ?
not bad . but i like to do extent .
oh yes . they 're on sale today .
do you have to cook a good clean of the table ?
i think that would be a great idea .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?

but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .

when you lose your job you live in the states have to save energy .
thank you very much . i am looking forward to hearing from you about this .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .

when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
we will .

i see . but why you have to take english for at least as a secretary ?
i can confidently say that my chinese and english are pretty good . i won prizes in many speech contests in both chinese and english .
i did . but anyway i have trouble with my qualifications and experience .
why do you plan to change your job ?
well what kind of salary do you provide ?

yes do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
how long do you have ?
how do your brother know that ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

i learned to be pop music from yoga .

yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
do you think that it is a strange teacher ?
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
then how about i go to read the results ?
i see . now i have all of my test results .
in a word you should present the best of yourself .

yes . there are a mouse and a camera .
i have been having trouble breathing . thank you .

you 're going to need to take a few pictures of the famous museum .
yes it can show your good attainment as well .

i have to work on it .
i hope that it makes you feel better too .

i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .

that 's a deal .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

yes i am . thanks .

i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ?
yes i 've been in a host home before .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
i 'd love to . thank you .
how much ?
good . welcome to our company . i am very happy to work with you . have you gained your experience of accounting ?
it 's a <unk> .
you 're right . we 'll have to insist on the contract .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
let 's see . . . what 's your price ?
yes . and i agree with all his policies .
yes . i have a very good one . i am sure we can find something suitable for you .
but you must take the quality into consideration .
yes the price has been reduced by 50 . it s a real bargain .
i think you re right . but i wonder if you could possibly give us a discount .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
i understand that . we need some mascara too . do you have a subscription for the longer prices ?
the gross thing is to do now that is what you need to do . usually you do our most important thing with the boss <unk> in your card there is no room for all the nights .
yes . i just got off at the airport .
i need to get my license .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i wish to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what about my resume ? it s definitely a good thing . . .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
well it s a very important experience . because there are several routine types of things . first of conversation can give you a few minutes .
it seems that a lot of people don t seem to have a good boss like you .
the most efficient thing is that i will have done on the first ball .
yes i think the internet is more simple . also there are many advantages . i 'm sure you 'll like them .
no really ?
i 'm very fond of you .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
could you tell me how to do it ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you 'll be busy on friday . . . .
yes . and it is called people to pay them quite a bill .
martha gets jealous easily and it took me to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i am doing what i mean .

well i do have to keep an eye of my plan and let them know if we have an a policy of both we have to work and then we ll be doing whatever to do .
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
i think that a good idea .
alright . but she s not the time . she s fed up with her boyfriend .
excellent . the monthly salary is echoing with crackling sounds !
oh i 'm glad to hear that . why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
company will get a bonus at the same time . all they need is to do is sign the paperwork .
wow ! that sounds like something she would really enjoy ! are there any people waiting for ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
well i approach things very enthusiastically i think and i do n't like to leave something halfdone . it makes me <unk> ca n't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing
ok i see .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled english education in high school and it was published in the education magazine .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
yes . but they should be used in an english class .
can you read and write english well ?
yes i can . i speak it very well .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
oh i do n't know . you can stay with him .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so why did you leave your last position ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .

no i did n't . i 'm sorry .
i want to make a list of your camera .
but you know that it is hard to find a job right now .

you were using a kind of machine
they were n't working as a waitress at the student health center .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
i have n't heard anything .
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
were you so angry ?
how did you feel about the food ?
really ? what did they do ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
they said they 'd better go out on the haj . that s why i have n't been to getting married yet .
was anything to drink ?
he was alone .
who cares ?
no i have n't .
it seems that if i 'm going to have to .
i do n't know .
but that was the first thing that was it ?
what was the band ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
did you see the <unk> thing that you did n't eat ?
i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better prepare for the worst .
no i was scared when i saw someone walking in the theaters get a hold of rain check and their junk food .
i 'm sorry about that . it was n't . and i 'm sure they will do whatever they can .
no what 's up ?
just a few minutes .
were you serious ? do you know how ?
how did you get the right elevator ?
blackout ? even the tv has the tv news .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
no but she did n't say anything about it .
that 's too bad . a bit more than a barbecue . let 's go there .
i do n't know . he gave me this number for you .
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it it wasn t her yet .
i would like to make my plea .
i am sorry . i will remind you that the guests are <unk> .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but what ? you are saying that .
but you do n't realize that you have to do so many things .
it 's so beautiful here .
i hope that the company will change .
there are n't many people .
well that s the best i can do .
how much are you asking ?
i think it 's a bit of a surprise . well i 'd better not give it out .
i know . what a pity .
i was there for about three weeks .
what did they do ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's not a bad idea .
if you want to save money the money we will give you the money and your usd will be ok . you can have it insured from the government .
well . i think i 'll have to tell him that . in fact i do n't want to be late .
ok . it 's a good idea to meet some friends and enjoy the game .
i did n't realize that . what should i do ?
it seems you 're very fond of it .
last weekend while they were on the sik trip .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i was very tired after working all week . sometimes on the weekend i do n't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater .
it is unnecessary .
i was robbed .
yeah you 're right . i also wish the weather was so exciting .
i do n't think i 'm right . i just wish i could ask the bus driver 's in case .
she must be sad .
i think i know who you are talking about . there 's always some bad misses in his interview and even his boss .
then what would you do with it ?
i was robbed .
so it seems that myra should be able to work on advertising .
i did n't know that . i think the government should do something that can to help us .
are you sure you 're not a woman ?
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
what a set of rooms do you have ?
what you think is the damage to the car ? if you do n't reduce it to that would be a problem .
it is terrible to hear that .
no i think i am .
i m fine .
nothing .
i know what you 're doing . tv is much fun . and i think a lot of tv .
perhaps you should also remember the type of post office . you d better attach a pin number of references .
after the long standing good records have not done anything to do with the basic movements . both parties are by the way .
well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
have you been given any other benefits ?
yes . we have . if we do n't have to go to the transport party has just been quite a few mistakes .
who s that ?
what do you think ? i m a good boy .
certainly . i m starving too . we could go for a pizza in the kitchen . that s exactly what i wanted .
oh really ?
what about all the things ?
so what are your symptoms ?
i 'd like to buy some foreign currency . it 's possible to send some money to taiwan .
so as long as you have one of your ticket i can apply for a credit card with you .
so as i have one of those i have one of my designs ?
okay i 'll need the money back .
here it is . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
yes . here it is . by the way i can open a checking account with you and i 'll need to go ahead .
i want to send some important documents to canada for my postgraduate admission .
well your banking system is a financial situation . there are some details about our demand savings account with us . of course you can use the money from a current account .
how much do you want to send it to ?
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i 'm calling .

so as long as i have one of those i can apply for a personal pledge loan ?

i see . so it 's not a problem i 've been looking for another job with your company for 6 months and i do n't think it 's as if you are eligible for this .
well . . . what 's your way ?
i think the most useful thing is the nature of the loan . its repayment period for a long time to buy some us dollars .
that sounds fine to me . i 'll accept the payment policies in the branch .
no sir . the gym is absolutely free . however be sure to take your room key with you .
yeah . can you show me how to use my key card ?

i 'm sorry . we 'll manage the goods according to the agreed time .
that 's great . i 'd like to try that on .
all right see you then .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i see . we 'll have to discuss it with our manager .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yes i did . what else should i do now ?
as you are allowed .
the goods are wellexamined before shipment . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
ok i will take them .
i think that is a danger and i think that the thing is that most male customers in female customers care about is because of the worry .
i am majoring in french literature .
well . . . how many departments are there ?
ok . i 'll take them .
oh i see . can we have the goods ready ?
it is a reasonable price .
i suppose you are right . we have no choice for the loss we sustained .
thanks . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to go to the next step .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right . i 'll check it .
i guess so .
that would be nice . can you read it ?
ok ! we 'll meet at your price .
i 'd like to have a look at your ticket .

in our office we do n't have to worry about that . we will give you a definite answer in detail . what is your solution ?
of course . you know our products are competitive and those in the exhibition . we 're the same products in the exhibition .
so far from our business we could be able to reduce our price by five percent .
i 'm sorry i 'm afraid i do n't think i 'm following myself .
really ? i 'm surprised .
i am sure we can . we usually quote on a cif basis and a few of the items you are looking for .

i think you 'll try to reduce our price by 5 percent .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow i see .

here are your keys . check out time is noon .
i ve read your application materials with interest . now i want to ask you a few questions if you don t mind .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i think so . should we put in mind for coffee ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the edd offices .
but what do you think is to be a little more important ?
he 's been having a lot of trouble with his work .
are there any other clauses in marine policies ?
only 2000 yuan .
do i get a card ?
no . i ve been here for 3 months .
ok i ll take my bag and leave my bag !
no that 's too early . i usually go to bed around two .
i m proud of you for standing by something hundred and fifty dollars . i think you re a great deal . what do you think ?
the night life there !
some more chinese tea for us please .
i know but we are going to do that .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what is the cause of the accident ?
the total is 90 days .
impressive ! i m not going to the match by this match .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to take the driver 's course . how many hours do i need ?
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
i wish i could but i m not sure i ll be able to travel by 5 again .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you . please select an option . you need to select an option . you can give a refund .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !

no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no ! stupid machine what are you doing !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
can you tell me how many copies you want ?
i would like to leave a message . how long does it take to get a reply from you ?
what 's the difference between an outlet and a regular price .
well to be frank i can t give you an estimated price . we are already willing to work with your price .
you have a 15 day .
an excellent idea . a timely delivery means that we can get together and attend attend tonight .
yes . we ve had a very good time working with them . we should be able to help them with them .
that 's already very quick .
