no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
all right . i 'll just have it ready .
yes but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
that 's ok . here is the address .

let 's look at our menus .
this will work out well .
oh i see . you ve got to tell me what you eat when you 're abroad .
ok . i will deposit my bag right now . you can deposit the items you want .
good idea .
well . . . it 's certainly a service . let 's go to the back and have a look .
i was worried about my son .

one of my friends tells me that the most important thing is the ability to get into the office .

i like the month of interest .
you have n't thought about that . it 's hard to get a new apartment .

of course we can come to look for that .
why ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i know . it is a hard gift .
of course it is ! we do n't get any of the business yet . we should send our customers a lot of good connections with our boss .
well maybe you 're right . i 'll come back to my office tomorrow and have it ready for my wife .
why are you going to have to drive to a new house ?
how long until you find that way ?
we can check out the kitchen next .
would it be a pity to find a place that would be a place to live in .
yes on that day we went to a flea market .
well then what about the room ? do you think it 's a good idea to get a promotion ?
i feel they 're dirty .
that will be a big favor . i wonder if we could take a look at it this time .
no not only that one . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if you go to the bus stop in the next block you can find a good place to go there . it 's not far from the subway station .

thank you madam .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
no thanks . i 'll pass . it looks very tempting though .
well perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead .
i do n't feel like drinking tonight .
that 's great . i think it 's the best way to relax .
but they are n't as light right ?
the contestants are different . these girls perform in free styles .
i ca n't believe it . i think i 'm men .
let me see . i 'm short of money .
i thought he was with a gun .
yes . there are at least one hour left in the hotel .
which gate should i go to ?

yes it 's really savory .
fine . well i 'll bring you a soup and salad .
i 'll have a glass of wine .
maybe i 'm not sure . what are you going to have ?
just cut a little off your nose to kill it .
do you think that i should eat it in the dressing room ?
we do n't like any soup .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
sure . which one do you like best ?
it 's my pleasure . we 'll have a great time .
so show me the time please .
ok . i 'll just have a try .
what do you think he 'll be talking about ?
i promise !
sure . what would you like ?
call me mr . smith .
i 'm afraid we do n't . but i 'm sure you 'll enjoy our lunch special .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
oh there are french wine with you .
what are we having ?
yes of course . there 's one at the corner of that street .

you should change your mind at first .
that 's great . thank you for your help .
that 's a good idea . it 's a lot of fun .
oh yeah . to tell you the truth i 've never thought of that .
we have a special lobster . what would you like to have ?
well do you have a vip room ?
that sounds fine . how about a single room ?

what about cocktail ?
we 'll have the chicken and then make an order of 36 . 00 .
how long will it take ?
i 've got whiskey and brandy but i need some beer and soda . that s all .
oh yes . i did n't expect to hold a table for two .
it 's 530 by my chinese food .
that 's fine . do i have to pay for the whole wheat bread ?
yes . please sit down .
i have a long flight here . i 'm going to it .
a pound of ground beef would be good . a 1 . 50 dollars is enough . 48 .
no why do n't we just grad a bite at the coffee shop next door ?
seventy us dollars .
here is ten dollars .
she likes it very much . it 's very popular in america .
yeah try not to kick or hit the computer !
only 700 yuan .
no not yet . i just want to hair cut .
you will have to be one of the most famous local furniture in your room . it 's our biggest pan .
that will be the best one .
well they are in the boat . let me check . . . they 're on the back to make sure they 're not <unk> .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
thirty dollars a minute .
let me check for a check .
if you think it 's expensive . you can look at this one .
i think that 's a good point . you ca n't go down the street to the comfortable .
oh certainly . that s a good idea . here you are . anything else ?

it s a monthly salary .
i do n't care .
it 's 308 a night .
that 's all right . let me think about it .
and please let me have a look . you know our delivery has already . i 'm not so happy to accept this .
only 2 dollars per year . that is my last word . i also need three pounds of chicken breasts .
i 'm sorry but my grades are not good enough .
i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .
oh . you see i 'm looking for it .
that 's great ! i 'll leave you my message .
i hope you can give me some advice . i 'm sick and tired of coming here or to my office to pay my utility bills . it 's such a long way from my home but i checked and you are my nearest branch . is there anyway i can do it from home ?
of course . there is also a large selection of tea .

i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
i appreciate you telling me .
no thank you . i need to help .
ok .
hi .
well you can get cheap apartment for you .
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

good idea . i ll take it .
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the internet .
oh well . how long does it take to get there ?
oh yes . it 's just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
do n't you think it 's a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right . well i ll send them to the store .
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yes of course . i really appreciate that .
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the price of the real thing .
this one of the most popular . i know that they are asking for us .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i didn t really like it !
yes you look very nice .
i would like to transfer some money .
this is kevin .
well i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to take all my things .

would you like to go now or later ?
hi john . i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
oh . i 'm glad she 'll be able to help us .
hi for making a break . i need a new pair of shoes for next week .
i 'll buy two pairs of each .
and not expensive either .
well you have to get up early enough . so you should attend the school in the morning and finish your homework .
now let me have a try .
i know . but i am her brother not her servant .
now let me have a double room for you .
you can ask the boy at the cafeteria .

well it s a charge for that .
that will be fine .
thank you sir . we look forward to your arrival .
yes it is ok . i will make the call to make it a few days .
that s all right . thanks for your help .
i am so happy .
call the police .
well since you agree with me we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels .
i can give you the phone number over here please .
well how about the cinema ?
ok i 'll buy it .
we should do this more often .
wait a minute . i will get your phone ready as soon as possible .
nah i am not . please bring a bottle of wine as well .
do you want to bring the <unk> ?
yes . that 's the one .
i am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow .
i recommend mao tai it s the best dish in china .
fine . i 'll bring some wine .
it 's half past seven .
that 's all right . we 'll be there in about 2 minutes .
when do you need to be there ?
of course i 'm ok . i 've just come from my house to meet my parents in the weekend .
i heard about that . it 's a furnished shop .
what 's that about ?
that s something that you really need to work on .
why do n't you go and see the empire state building ?
of course i can do that .
the most important thing is that you can take them to the company . they are the ones that are company for care about .
i want to try on this pair .
take a look at the ones on display please .
yes why do n't you follow the tv for football ?
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
i agree how much ?
you are absolutely right . this is what i want .
sure i 'll have a coke first .
so how about an aperitif ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
all right . which one will you want ?
please fill out this form .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
fine . how many tickets do you want to go with me ?
i do n't like your service .
enjoy yourself .
i am sorry sir . i know we have no choice .
actually i do n't like ice cream with nuts in it .
i agree . do you have a favorite ?
well then there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
i do n't think i can have a glass of tomato juice .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
are you kidding ?
italian . they are delicious . they taste very <unk> .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
so i 've been thinking about something like that before !
ok . i have to make a date tonight .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
it may be a good idea to eat brunch instead .
oh yes . that 's what i ordered .
<unk> . . . what 's that ?
ok i will go with you .
thanks . we look forward to serving you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
it 's really delicious .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
what do you mean by something else ?
not really . i would say they like to be on the national holidays like those civil wars . they all have to be after a long time .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
it 's a very good choice . but i think the better one is more important than the others .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
i am the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that . this is a good thing .
you are right .
what 's her personality like ?
do you have a problem with your suspect ?
ok . do you want any film ?
well let me check again under a different heading .
thank you . i won t miss it .
this is our office block .
are you scared of anything ?
we have a requisition form on the company web site . what type of supplies do you have in mind ?
how do you plan on going to do your part of the day ?
may i know what you do ?
do you have a car ?
could you please look at the five men in this lineup ?
what ? did you find it ?
don t worry . that s a lot of money .
some more chinese tea for us please .
what 's the way that we have to work overtime ?
well if you do n't have any questions shall we get started ? if you 'll follow me first i 'll take you to the site of our semiconductor system . . .
that 's fine . she 'll be back in about eight o 'clock .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
ok .
i 've got to get off work .
yes his house is having a great time . you should be able to make it yourself double room .
what about a coffee ? i 've got an idea .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
well i 'll be careful .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
that will be fine . she will be right back soon .
so you have to wear uniforms at home and sugar .
what does she look like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
you 'll get used to it . if you do n't mind let me send you a refund .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes . i ve made a reservation for a single room with a bath here .
is everything in the fridge leftovers ? i hate leftovers !
i have a horrible rash from poison oak .
yeah it 's really amazing . i 've been so happy for it .
yes but i was afraid to fall back asleep . i am worrying about it .
of course . please fill in this form and write down your name and the amount of the card .
that s fine . is there anything else ?
we re going to have to do an investigation on this .

thank you . i 'll give you mine too .
thanks a lot . it s very kind of you .
you are welcome . goodbye .
that 's all right . it s nothing to do .
i feel they 're dirty .
if i make the decision will i be able to assist the people in the future ?
i have a great time tomorrow .
i can do that .
and not expensive either .
so i do n't have to worry about them .
they want a special promotion .
all right bill . here s your daily exercise schedule . you are to jog before breakfast .
jog ?
then you are to walk to work .
walk ?
thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
oh no .
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
oh dear .

i 'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .
at cars ! you are n't thinking about buying a car are you ?
yes i am . i 'd like to be able to get around a little more .
but it will be expensive to have a car in the city wo n't it ?
oh i do n't know . of course gasoline costs a lot these days .
but what about parking ? you ca n't park on the street can you ?
a lot of people do . i 'll try it for a while anyway but i certainly do n't want to pay a lot of parking tickets .
it 's hard to say . but i do love waltz very much .

he said that he should pay a fine .
we can help you with that . but you may be travelling on a <unk> basis for the next two weeks .
i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
are you sure you are right ? there are many interesting things to learn .

well i see . how about the other one ?
i did n't do that .
please do n't worry . he 'll have to drive you . he 's already paid with the train .

it 's a difficult choice . the train is a little faster but much more expensive . it takes more than one hour .
let 's be careful .
there 's one more thing .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
i suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station .
oh my god . i do n't like it .
yes there 's a one here . it 's a big one .
ok . which train should i take to the station ?
we 've already got a look at the rental agency . it 's like a shop with a credit card .

i want chinese food .
yeah . what 's the time ?

i 'll call the bus charter later . and have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
oh that sounds nice .
i don t know .
yeah . i ll give you a blood test .
i am sorry .
i 'm sure it 'll be difficult to do it .
of course . it s quite simple really . when i was a child .
oh it s such a large family . do we have to pay part of the house ?
how about the features of the apartments in the city ?
it depends on how you want to travel . if you want a soft sleeper it will cost <unk> rib if you want a hard seat it will only cost <unk> .
ok . how about this one by airmail ?

i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
yeah i know what you mean . that 's the case of what you ask .
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . why ? it 's just the one of those little guys . . .
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
well let 's see . . . how much is this one ?
well i thought it was a little too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
this is true . if you do n't have a on the bus schedule you can get a discount on the weekends .
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yes that 's right . down here is the receipt .
it 's very easy . the government is to pay for it .
are these the only thing that is n't ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
you 'd better stop getting into the skin . if you eat the seed you 'll have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
well how much is a discount ?

do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?

how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well it 's a shop in the store .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
well can you eat the seed ?
no . you 'd better take some clothes too .
that 's a good idea . how can i be of your marriage ?
five yuan .
oh i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me . who 's this one ?
no i do n't like your cooking . i 'm sure i 'll like it .
yeah but it 's quite different from western countries .
where do they grow mangoes ?
i 'll take some too .
most of them in this store are from mexico .

how much are they ?

what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .

a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .

everyone in the <unk> needs is different !

that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .

i know i know . but i must go to another school to pick up .
of course . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
it sounds like you have a good deal .
oh no i 'm afraid not . these things are just too old to guarantee anything .
do you have anything to declare ?
down to his shoulders . it 's beautiful like gold .
i understand . how do you know if it has been a phone call ?
the internet is very popular with various buyers . so i 'm not sure you 'll agree to have the money but a good one is more good .
it 's pretty . can i try it on ?
ok . this one is a popular dish .
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
do you have a particular brand you would like ?

i d like to have typical chinese food .
is there any difference between chinese food ?
maybe we can try a thai massage too .
let s go and get a burger .
yes i really do n't think that winter would be great .
well i like hot food too .
they 're quite delicious . you can make some steamed fish and sour sauce best .
i would like to have a try .
well you can come to the right place . if you want to look at the ticket online you 'll have to pay for the ticket .
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
good . how much is the fare ?
just give me a minute . i ll check .
ok .
that s a good idea . i m going to have to drive an hour to work .
that 's not far .
it s too bad . we ll have to make a pleasant trip .
that 's terrible !
how about all them ? they 're quite different from the chinese folk art .
what s this ? we can t really go to the dance steps .
well could you pick up some sugar ?
no thanks . i 've had enough . now mary 's homework whatever is on the go .
nobody told you what happened ?
ok .
oh i see . i know . but you re right . i really got to go .
oh that 's terrible . i think we 'd better go now .
are you nuts ? let s go to a large coke .
i think something must be done .
are you having a car ?
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
where are you going to find one ?
many people don t like that .
thank you . i d be very happy to .
ok . i ll send someone to talk to you later .
when was the apartment due ?
i should tell you that the price is far too high .
that s a lovely neighborhood . it s very kind of you .
good idea . i noticed that there is a problem with the fine print .
where to sir ?
please take me to this address .
is it a direct light or a small city ?
i have to be there before <unk> .
ok see you then .
really ? well that 's fine . is there a problem ?
we 'll be happy to do it .
here 's twenty dollars .
only 2 dollars .
oh i see .
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes and i have the warranty too .
where are you heading sir ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
are you sure of any airline or round trip ?
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
how much is the ticket for ?
here is 50 dollars .
it 's a private garden .
you are kidding ! that 's a perfect choice .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
no problem . i am happy to help you .
thank you very much . here 's 10 .
oh hi . you 're back already . i 'm just calling to see if there is any way available .
that 's easy .
thank you . now just complete this form .
yes i am . i really need to change the date .
can i have my 200 please ?
no problem . how about we go for a picnic ?
ok .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! i like something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . just tell me your friend and i 'll see what he 's looking for .
ok . thank you .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know that .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we re right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when is he coming back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's hurt .
fine . are you free tomorrow ?
i 've been working really hard .
do you really think that you have a chance to grow on your job ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . but i am not a dancer and i do n't want to get too easily .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i started with my family last night .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's handsome .
but what does she think about her ?
yeah i know it 's the most popular thing .
hmm . . . that might be a good idea . how old is he ?
that 's great . but i ca n't stand it .
ok . i 'll come .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest <unk> at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
you are going to have to clean it up first .
when i put my elbows so that my nose will turn on . . .
ok . . . how much does it cost to get ?
what does that mean ?
great ! phew ! that was a close one ! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
hey . . . i bought this book ! it 's a <unk> thing with all the same <unk> . . .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
no not at all ! you just pay the attention of the road .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
what a perfect perfect perfect idea !
i don t have a long question . how long do you have some insurance ?
you are lucky . and how about a big shot ? it s a good idea to have a look at your bank !
so you can leave me at the movie time . i go back to dance often .
no i m afraid not . i ve got a small room .
thank you . do you have any picture of the latest ?
oh i see . but i need a large one .
here it is . the coffee shop is on the fifth floor . here is a blanket and beautiful river .
i don t buy an inexpensive camera . it s very old .
oh wait a minute ! where do you get that one ?
i don t want to buy that but how can you ever access to it ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
i 've just had it a little earlier .
what s wrong ?
thanks . let s go there .
i 'm sorry . what size are you ?
no problem anytime .
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment .
that 's going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
ok .
no thank you . that s all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
good . now that you have to fill out the form first .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need this prescription please .
how about some barbecue sauce ? they have n't had enough of those .
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear .
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting <unk> .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
how about a lizard ? are not very important in a public space . there 's no reason to we can afford a home here .
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen <unk> in ram and a hard disk with one <unk> . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric <unk> and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
i hope you can give me some advice . i 'm sick and tired of coming here or to my office to tell me .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes . i had a bad traffic accident .
it s so good because we had such a great time !
oh i m sorry . you re right . it isn t the largest dress in the world . you re welcome here .
i will try and get it out of the store . it looks very attractive .
oh good come on . tell me what happened .
i don t think that is included in the price .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are several seats in the size . do you have it ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now if you re leaving it s my pleasure to help .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but it should be easier for the environment to get done in the library .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s in the bedroom .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
good . how much are you looking for ?
i can t believe it .
you ll have to pay 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do now ?
that s not a problem .
that s what my computer is showing .
if you could stay in this way i ll go and buy another car .
that was my fault .
well in that case we ll always do my best to lower the price .
yes i do . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
i don t think i can do that . it s always there .
no i think it 's really good . i have always been trying to buy something !
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
okay . do you have a particular brand ?
maybe a little too expensive .
i 'm afraid i do n't like the colour either . i think the blue one is better . it 's a bit tight .
but you know it 's a bit expensive .
i m going to take care of it for a while . i think it s about time to get some exercise .
all right . i ll be back for you .
of course you can . they look very nice today .
we need 30 for each .
all right . anything else ?
i want to wear a casual dress .
thanks . i think you need a holiday .
sir your bill is ready .
i m the manager . may i help you ?
i am calling to let you know that i am looking for a job that is current .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
it 's a great idea . i would love to try it on .
oh it s a pity that i should go look at the internet to see what we 're looking for .
good . i will see you then .
can you be there before 1 o 'clock ?
no i think i know what to do .
why not ?
should i bring anything with me ?
no . that 's all . thanks .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i know . let me have a look . it 's on the invoice .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
that s great . i think the air conditioning is very heavy .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i think that you are interested in this job .
that will be great !
i heard that you pay it for the rent .
why do n't you just finish cooking in case of the refrigerator ?
good idea . i think i 'll wear the blue one .
i know . it looks new .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i will take it .
we have two kids and a dog .
that is exactly what i want to say .
oh and it s a good idea .
i hope everything goes well .
i see . let me see .
it 's a manmade wonder . i 've seen it many times in textbooks and it 's part of my dream to get rid of my stay here .
i love the beautiful lawn . how many kids are they ?
let 's check the kitchen . i am back to you .
very well . thank you .
that s what i charge .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello mr . stern . this is hao bo from the international travel agency . i have made the plane reservations for you .
it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i thought it would be a great pity . but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive to apartment .
let s go .
yeah . i 've got to go for a drink .
that 's good . this is your key . if you can get a class by ten o 'clock and take it at around 6 p . m .
no i 'm a little worried about my schedule .
we have a deal then .
that 's fine . please give me the name and phone number .
no . thank you .
i would like to transfer some money .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
i am afraid i have n't had any experience in just this sort of work .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
well thanks for the understanding .
well that depends .
can i have my 200 please ?
it is hard to find a parttime job to do . why do n't you come with a family ?
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm always worry about that .
can i have my 200 please ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
oh that 's me .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the time .
well i will probably come back later . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
i can get you some snack sauce .
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i 'm free on schedule .
i ve been wearing my hair long for years .
ok please fill out the form first .
not too long .
that is a good idea . after all you need to keep the gift from the cut .
i 'm afraid i do n't agree . i 'm afraid i 'll be able to do this for a while .
i would like to help you with the itching .
no not at all . you can sit down for a little while .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes right . it does .
can i have my 200 please ?
i know darling . i don t know what to do . i ve done that .
well i think the color is better than your hair .
but i will not forget her mother .
can you work parttime or fulltime ?
ok . but after a few minutes you 're right .
it 's very kind of you .
sure . then one of the most famous works in the world . it is more comfortable than the second .
oh that 's a good choice . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i like the month of interest .
you have n't thought about that . it 's hard to get a new apartment .
yeah i 'm glad you came here .
of course we can come to look for that .
i know what you mean .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i know . it is a hard gift .
of course it is ! we do n't get any of the business yet . we should send our customers a lot of good connections with our boss .
well maybe you 're right . i 'll come back to my office tomorrow and have it ready for my wife .
why are you going to have to find a new house ?
how long until you contact the sellers with your acceptance ?
we can check out the kitchen next .
would it be a pity to find a place that would be a place to live in .
yes on that day we went to a flea market .
well then what about the room ? do you think it 's a good idea to get a promotion ?
i feel they 're dirty .
that will be a big favor .
no not only that one . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
no . but it 's a bit expensive though .
that sounds like a good idea .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about the new bar across the street ?
i prefer seafood .
i really like chinese food . i am getting more chinese to eat .
oh yes . i remember when i first came here yesterday .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no i have n't . i 'm learning chinese .
do you like some of those ?
maybe you 're right .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like to try some ?
oh no . i 'm full . i 'm going to do my best .
have you been learning japanese every day ?
sure . i 'll ring to see you . it 's very kind of you .
well i was wondering if you would like to go somewhere with me on the menu .
i think i 'll go and get it . i 'm just gonna go and get it now .
ok . i have to do that .
that s right .
alright . and i can see that now . is there a chinese restaurant ?
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
no . not really .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i want you to buy the insurance policy .
that 's true . but what shall we do then ?
oh that 's easy . i 'll buy one .
well they are packed in boxes of two dozens each 100 boxes to a wooden case .
that 's good to know . thanks .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but they may have a bigger one .
yes i do . i could go to the gym to have a good time .
come on ! it 's just a picnic . it 's fun .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
when was the company founded ?
she was a famous designer for our company . i was told that if i 'd like to get a promotion .
good . if you like your positive attitude i will take you to a 3 .
that fee should keep you from overdrafting .
it 's a good idea to buy some more but i think it 's really something new .
ok .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
may i do anything else for you ?
yes a camera .
what about our mobile phones and cameras ? did you charge them last night ?
i want to send them to my friends .
go and try it .
oh i do n't know . i need to buy a new one .
would you mind showing me the most important thing for me ?
how about the price ?
you have to pay for the tv .
it 's absolutely amazing . will it be expensive to check whether the price is higher ?
i 'd be quite willing to help . as you say i 'm afraid i ca n't help you with that .
the first thing is being needed by the company .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you sir . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor .
how long will it take to get my coat ?
please put down the table in front of you . it 's more comfortable that way .
that 's a good idea .
all right . i 'll just go and get a pair of them .
sure go ahead .
i do n't know how to say it in english .
that 's why i came to see it . i am afraid it is not a little too late .
is anyone else sick in your home ?
it 's about 20 degrees centigrade .
do you have a taken a walk around the street ?
they sure are . you just have to give them the impression that the goods are <unk> .
is that so ? i do n't like chicken either .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
when i was a child i always tune up my mouth and have a try to find one available . so let 's go to the us .
well i do n't think i 'm ready for a start until i got here .
oh i see . do n't worry about that i did n't think that they were doing a good job .
yes i did . i spent the weekend in my life with relatives around me 247 .
of course i 'm fed up with it .
absolutely ! that 's what i thought . . you know it has no value but it has to be a great sense of humor .
about once a week .
come on ! you know you are getting fatter .
yeah . you know i could always make dishes like this .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like .
whenever i go to the supermarket i always cook a lot of things .
last but we have a great time !
yes . sometimes i advise you to buy something at the moment .
so what do you think about it ?
i usually eat there at lunch time .
yeah i like thai food too . do you like chinese food ?
my favorite is diablo . it tastes too well but i do n't know what it is .
i 'll give you the word for it .
hey that 's not fair .
it 's the one who wanted to be there . you 'd better be happy to have the party .
a sprite sounds good .
good idea . i want some red wine .
i think i 'll use them now .
no not for me . it 's a very serious waste of time .
that 's a good idea . but i prefer wine with meat .
haha . . . well you have to make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly yours was n't up to date that 's probably what you drink .
cappuccino is onethird espresso and twothirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth .
she seems to have a good ear for the children but that 's ok . i 'll see him .
sounds good . i 'll have that .
sure . i 'll try my best .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes . i 'll have to get your license .
i m thinking of making a bookcase . give me some more which i call you the best .
you really like it ?
i do n't know . i 'm really not going to make dinner .
that sounds great .
i would love to get some chinese food .
that sounds really good .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
i do n't know . i 'm still going to cook tonight .
yeah but i 'm not eating too much .
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
no thank you . i 'm in a hurry .
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
how many would you like ?
i ca n't bear eating less .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
i 'm fine .
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
i 'm good . i do n't want to waste my time walking .
you really should n't eat too much .
i do n't want to eat anything .
that sounds nice . did you eat any vegetables ?
i like what kind of games do you like ?
but please do n't tell me them .
oh it 's hard to say . they are the two cameras i guess .
do n't you like them ? they 're so heavy .
why do n't you pick them up ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
they 're on me .
of course . they are very fresh and exceptionally juicy .
and the red ones ?
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
we also have a lot of wine .
ok .
i have my book from class here . how do you say this word ?
what kind of soda would you like ?
i ca n't .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
what kind of soda can i get you ?
i 'll have a glass of wine .
i 'm not feeling too well .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
i 'm awfully sorry to have made you a mistake .
just a beer please .
do you know where your polling place is ?
a sprite please .
where did you go ?
sure . but it must be really painful .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
a sprite sounds good .
what about cigarettes or cigars ?
i ca n't bear eating less .
excellent choice . can i dish you up some chicken ?
i do n't want to eat anything .
and what about some chicken ?
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
but people like them .
i like the back with a bath .
but they are n't as convenient as the subway .
why do n't you buy them at home ? they 're so hungry .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
ok . i 'll pick you up around 6
yes i 'd like a apple pie .
why ? i think so .
how about the rice dish ?
i do n't have the slightest clue .
here is your key . if you need anything just dial 0 on your room phone .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you ve never tried it .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you ve never tried it . you know what ? it s all your point !
i 'd like to have some kind of pie .
i have never tasted that .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
that is great ! i never knew you would cut down on your sugar intake as well . you have really liked .
where can i get you from the cafeteria ?
what kind of salad dressing would you like ?
how many people will be coming for the dinner tonight ?
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to have some kind of pie first .
why do n't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ?
will you bring your shrimp with you ?
i 've never tasted anything like this .
i 'm not sure . i have n't decided yet . can you recommend something ?
i have never tasted that .
yeah right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
that is really an attractive taste . i am sure you have good happy ending for it .
well i like the system . it 's a great gift .
i have no idea what i want to have .
i 'm not sure . i 'm pretty sure i 'd like the fish .
i 'll give you the lowest price .
please bring me the chicken chops .
i think you 'll love it .
that 's great . it 's my pleasure to have you with us .
the vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .
does that include everything ?
let 's order something else .
i think i 'll ty the crisp deepfried chicken .
not really . but i do n't like any food .
well i 'll come to the front to have your own price range and then i 'll go back to the store later so that is kind of meat .
it 's my pleasure .
sure . how about some coffee shop next to it ?
i 'll be glad to do it . what are you going to have to do with us ?
i 'm not sure i 'll try a chinese wine .
is there anything else ?
sure . can i serve you anything else ?
that s fine ! i should admit that you are not allowed to use my computer for me .
i have n't seen it .
why ?
two small boxes .
where ?
no we don t have time to put out of order .
well i think the red sweater is very fresh .
the judge will let you know .
i see .

did you bring your ticket ?
well i thought you had an elephant in your house .
i got it .
may i ask where you live ?
it 's great !
i 'm sorry but i do n't think i need to see a credit card .
ok . is it expensive ?
if you do n't mind me asking .
that 's too bad . how did you have to do that ?
i got it at the train station .
is the furniture pretty bad ?
it was under the sign of the gas .
ok here 's the number with me .
do n't you have any luggage to check in ?
i 'm afraid i do n't .
do you have any luggage to check in ?
what 's the charge for my car ?
sorry . you should n't have asked for it .
you mean i have to wear a new car ?
i wanted some chips at lunch today so i spent it .
ok .
i m glad you understand .
will my record be cleared after i pay the fine ?
yes i 'm afraid that 's what i 'm doing .
that 's just the last bus .
did you bring any other tickets ?
oh let 's see . . . about six .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any .
that 's the best part .
tell me what the cost of the background is .
i 'm not sure .
i got it .
it 's worth every penny of it .
good !
how about 130 yuan ?
i got it .
only four days ! that 's so short and you seem so crazy about her .
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather eat eggs drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a <unk> before which basically means you do n't eat meat but still have fish and seafood .
six months ?
i already knew that .
i just wanted to let you to know if that does n't work .
oh no <unk> . i didn t mean for you to pay for me when i invited you to go tonight . let s go dutch . i ll pay my own way . i insist .

i should be able to pay my rent .
i have n't seen it .
i 've been to one of my life .
did you bring your ticket ?
it 's a brick ! i ca n't believe how stupid i was . damn it !

ok here 's the number with me .
i live in the haitian district .

i did n't do anything . finally he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
oh you can always find things at the school and make your life cheaper .
well that 's just because i do n't have any time .
a dime is too bad .

we 're going to need to put a ticket in the next door .
it was my first time to wait for the next one .
okay here 's my id and the 27 .
the cereal is over by the breakfast foods .

no i 'm not sure .
well do n't you know for sure ?
well we want to get a further promotion .
it 's not like our own .
no but we have a car in the whole hour .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
that 's true . we should take a taxi to get there .
that 's a good idea .
there on the window .
there is n't a chance that could be a little calm .
my wife 's car was trying to leave me the sales plan . now she 's here . . .
but we could take the subway .
i 'm falling in love .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
you 're welcome let me go wrap the ground beef up for you .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
oh susie . didn t i tell you over and over again that you wouldn t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ?
no i usually just drive .
you have your own vehicle ?
no but i could take the bus .
what does the notice say ?
it 's a good idea to try .
i do n't think that is too much for a man to decide your career .
we start at the high school or go straight down the street .
what do you think about our friendliness and attitude ?
i am sure my friend can give you a ride .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .

thanks for letting me know .
i 've been working a lot lately .

it 's no use contact . it 's a good thing .
it 's only your blood pressure . you could learn how to use it .
sure no problem . leave it to me . now if you can correct it in the next couple of days .
that 's very nice of you .
i told you not to forget to bring the letter .
this is unfair .
ok i think i 'll go myself .
my favorite job is on weekends .
our two tickets ?
wow . that 's really something new . i 'm looking forward to that .
here is a gift for you . i hope you like it .
i 've been working quite a lot .
yes sir . what are you doing now ?
i was robbed .
you have no reason to bring this letter .
i 'm watching tv . i want to get a hold of time .
i agree with you . and i think you re right .
i think i want to try a new style .
so what happened ?
i have been studying every day .
i know what you mean . i thought you had ! what you were with all the jokes ?
yes i have . i 'd like to get a ba but i do n't know how to get paid yet .
can i have my 200 please ?
the usual amount of new employees will be there in 5 days .
i like the novels of inches very much .
what other kind of music do you like ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i know you are not the only one who has trouble with .
a soft seat or hard one ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
it 's really <unk> . you do n't have to tell me about it .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
oh i 'm afraid we 'll have to ask for more taiwanese guests .
well i guess i could give you some new characters .
everything is fine . and you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
my english teacher is in the hospital .
well i like to be a singer but i do n't think the music is right there .
we are looking for a job at the state right now .
you wo n't be disappointed .
then we will be in a hurry .
oh i 'm glad . how about a drink tonight ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
really ? i am very glad to hear that .
i feel they 're dirty .
that 's a great idea . i think my grandmother can learn a lot from it .
i think you can read english quite fluently . this is my new language habits .
i agree . it s just a little .
ah i have lost control of it .
well i have to tell you that i 've put in my notice .
it will be held at the national bank .
i have my number for the library .
i feel they 're dirty .
oh i see . thanks .
there are several excellent sources you can use for the treadmill . the course is for ability to use the computer and learn .
i hope it was not to get too expensive to me . i can t afford to find a way to get away from my home .
yes it includes both social customs and half a number of both have been booked .
that 's good . i 'll come in later today . if i make the final decision i like to go right now i just need to the manager to make a change .
i thought there was a misunderstanding !
do you think that many people will have a few wars holiday for ten people ?
i can help you with that .
i 'm going to study .
you re going to take courses ?
oh yes . i am going to take some courses there .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
is there anything else ?
hey i 'm a pretty cool guy i 've got a work on my own . he 's so pretty cool .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
yeah . he s always busy with his pictures and roses .
it 's on the left of the internet .
great ! will you need me to do my best ?
you can check out two books at a time .
great ! will you please tell me how to take it ?
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
that 's fine . i appreciate the price .
there are a lot of them .
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
good luck to you .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you . i 'm from the united states .
yeah . how about you ?
ok . can i help you to get some information about the shop on the map ?
yeah . i think is more important than the old one .
i used to play drums but i never know how to play for a while . i used to play basketball .
that 's good . i 've always wanted to go to the us . i heard your parents are very happy to do the same .
well that 's true . i 'm sure you will enjoy the holiday . come on friday and i 'll take you to america .
i was n't able to go shopping . but then i 'm still waiting for my mother to get married .
do they have a large family ?
will you be able to make it ?
you mean i have to bring my textbook and a tape recorder . i would n't be too happy to give my parents a call this time .
i do n't think so . it 's perfect for me to go with you but i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .
ok please do n't forget to call me when you get back .
no . i did n't know anyone .
did you write a check for that person ?
just one .
fine . we will open one hour early for the next monday .
it 's very interesting .
which university did you leave from ?
well i think i 'm going to have some research about just to take a few useful course .
all right . i 'll have a look at the student id and check for you .
did you take any pictures of the famous civil films ?
a little of both . . you have to be one of those lady at the end of this month . how about your girlfriend ? i thought they would like to have a look !
did you get any other medical plan ?
you can say that again ! he wo n't get a promotion very well .
but he does n't deserve any help .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
a little bit of both .
i got a mother in a primary school .
so what was you responsible for ?
i 'll try to lose a weight . right now i have to take a according to the student bus stop and pay the fine .
let me see . i 'm sorry . according to the student poetry class has already taken a double decker bus . it 's the shakespeare class you have to pay in every month .
no . but it 's hard to believe that a new job is on the internet .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
i 'm sorry .
i hope so .
because it 's convenient and the environment is so crowded .
i guess . we got married last year right ?
excellent . so you 'll have to attend a good gift for the band .
did you guys play a lot of books before you go to the movies ?
excellent . i 've got a scholarship from my government for master 's degree .
so am i .
because of the tea which is better and the air is cheaper .
did you guys go to the movie ?
i was robbed .
how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?
i do n't think this is right .
hi .
hi linda . i have n't seen you for a long time . how long have you been ?
i went to australia and new zealand .
oh i went to a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be 200 subjects so i made lots of money from beijing .
in that case you need to get some more sleep .
no i am afraid not .
that is a very good deal .
well . i 'm not much tired .
why did you decide to leave your parents ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .

i heard that she is a great student .
i 'm sure you 'll find our decision .
i 'm not sure . she 's a gorgeous cookie .
i 'm afraid not . you do n't have to worry about that . what 's the problem ?
that 's true . the teacher said the truth will be quite dear .
i am not sure i know where the car is .
i don t want to be so sure .
i had to attend an interview tomorrow .
that 's not right .
they are direct communication with people and wrong .

i am worried .
i 'm worried about my work .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?

do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i ve already <unk> myself . i d like to help working with children .
i agree with you . i think you re right .
so you re right .
i remember that we received a good education program for the past years and had a great time .
well i think i could work out more too .
i agree . it s not an easy job .
i need to work my knowledge too .
that 's good . do we have to pay extra for that ?
i think you re right . i m thinking about this for everyone but i don t know what to do with it .
that s possible . if you remember to work overtime you can t be paid attention to your previous company .
pretty good thanks . and you ?
you 're welcome . good luck to you .
i want to know about the life of your company .
do you know what kind of food you want ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
did you happen to watch the football game last night ?
do you have any idea where it is ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
here s the least thing about big deal . this one looks big but not big enough . it s a lot of hassle .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe <unk> in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by <unk> . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
get some eggs milk and bread .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
yeah . they 're small but not very expensive .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to get a pair of trousers made to measure .

i don t think he s very serious .
that will be all right . we can do something else for you .
it 's not like me . the more important to me the better . i am not sure whether i can pass for it or not .
now you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed . so when you go through the series of twelve machines you enter in the number of repetitions you do . and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .
oh .
this one ?
according to the newspaper the order is by air by air on the third floor .

do n't worry . i 've been taking a look at the newspaper .
i want to know about the housing system in your company .
why do n't you just go and see me ?
well it 's hard to say . the thing is that you want to put on with it .
please be careful when you make it too tired .
my favorite job is to play computer games .
in my opinion a lot of people won t like that .
i know . you do n't have to ask me anything . do you ? i have a lot of questions about the job .
so can i buy some new shoes as a christmas present ?
i would like to make a deposit .
there s no problem .
i sure do .
what are you going to do with it ?
i d like to do that .
it s so noisy that i can t afford to get out of the city .

i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
oh i see . well it s time to say goodbye .

and what happened ?
yeah i did .

yes . he 's in a hurry .
they were supposed to do that . they had to get the brochures done and sent them to the end .
that 's unbelievable . why did you ask for a manicure of dollars ?
yes but what 's your number ?
yeah . i 'm lucky to be his wife .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .
jane i do n't think so . who 's your best man ?
this is not happening !
it 's the same in my family . the city was awful but it 's not as bad as the car . i just do n't think it 's broken .
i 've got it . i 'm so sorry to tell you that it 's all for you .
i 've heard that she 's very angry . what did she do to you ?

that 's all right . if you remember correctly people used to think that the traffic problem will be leaving tomorrow .
your other thing is n't it ?
i know . do you have time to leave the message ?
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
congratulations !
yes . that 's right .
are n't you kidding ? the <unk> were excellent .
i know ! but you 're done .
yes . i was there .
yes with a p . now do you have a credit card ?
i watched buddha buyer go up to 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at 325 ! i sniped him !
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
yes . it was a terrible thing .
this one is really nice .
i 'd better not . maybe i 'll be able to help .
oh yes . i 'm sure your mom will be back soon . how can i get there ?
really ? i hope it won t be too late .
no i 'll call the bus charter later . and have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
oh really ? where are we going to be on the sidewalk ?
yes . i 'm going to throw it out .
that 's a great idea ! i 'll get to a chinese restaurant !
that 's not too bad . . . hey do you think i could get a pair of toothpaste with a few people .
i have to do some more exercise .
i hope so . i could n't wait to throw it out !
oh i see . well let 's get some shows for each .
i didn t get accepted .
well i guess i can find it . how about coming for the afternoon ?
yeah . i think it 's a hey that 's really good .
that would be nice . can you read it ?
it 's simple . all we do is prepare some food usually sandwiches and some fruit and give it out to them at the soup kitchen .
i would like to do that .
that is also true . i 'm looking forward to it .
no thank you . i 'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .
here is the menu . wanna i look at the menu ?
yes but you can take a few pictures of the perfume .
good morning . could i speak to mr . wang ?
good morning miss li
i will listen and learn more when i start my new job . i plan to become more professional in my field .
you must be tired after your long flight . let me carry the suitcase for you .
that 's good to hear . how soon do you have the relevant information ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
thanks . sorry . i ll take care of it .
yes . it has a very large electrical system .
can you tell me when it is ?
well i think a lot of people would be great in the kitchen .
well i think the new perfume is worth of it .
i feel they 're dirty .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
is n't there a problem ?
she 's ten .
no . i 'd like to .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . if we go on a hiking trip i 'll be there for two weeks .
good . let 's go now .
now let s make ourselves comfortable since we have got quiet a long way to go .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't feel like drinking whole milk .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
we will all do is prepare the music .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
ok .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
oh no ! i 'm at the subway station .
i just stayed home and watched tv .
do you think that she 'll do well ?
certainly . what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a sweater .
oh never mind that . what 's wrong with it ?
i need to look for a new bedroom set .
do you have a seat preference ?
i m concerned about the cost of this card .
we 'll have this steak .
i need a new suit . i have a few choices here .
well we 've got an idea of how to use our store . it 's on the market .
<unk> bean would be fine .
we 'll contact you soon that i 'm ready and let you go .
i 'll have . you really insist .
that 's great . how much would you like to pay ?
sure . what comes with those ?
that 's the most important thing .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let s buy it for you .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
please register your information here and pay for it . and i ll make a medical record for you .
that 's no need .
no you can take the subway .
yes i think so . but it 's too heavy for me .
then my son drove into a tree
<unk> it is . <unk> jes speaking . how can i help ?
hi this is mr . stephen s secretary . he has an appointment with mr . jenkins .
yes . i 'm sure it 's still available . we have new service called the three months ago .
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
don t worry about that . i ll get you another one .
you are always like this . i guess i ll call the police if it s not .
thank you for your concern .
oh that 's a good idea . what about the dog ?
does it mean that you have a double room ?
yeah i know and you 're right . maybe i 'll go get it for you .
are you a member of the company ?
well i ll just ask them to put them on the new year . . we re leaving on time to put out some money on this project .
but you know the price of the order is always negotiable and we could not give you a discount .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i ve had my bad day yesterday .
i 've got to go to the office . i 'm waiting for my invitation .
that s great . i m glad you re finally here . . .
i ll have to try later .
i love you . i am so happy .
hey honey . . . it 's like watching . . .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
ok .
oh great !
will i be driving the bus or a taxi ?
i need to pay the fare too .
oh no ! i forgot to turn the alarm clock on .
what about tomorrow evening ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
don t worry . i ve got a million of it .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
well it 's not too bad . do you have a medium or something ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your <unk> hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the <unk> seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
good ! this is a wonderful game .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a truce . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
i m very sorry to hear that . i feel like it .
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
hey i know a lot about that . i m really sorry !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
well that 's time . if you get to the bottom bunk you 'll have to go .
i am so glad we met again .
you is a good exercise and i really love the smoke !
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i m not a cheater . i know you re going to quit !
are you kidding me ? i m too nervous !
you mean i look really attractive but what about you ? you are supposed to lose weight .
and not expensive either .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i need to wear uniforms at window seven days .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the <unk> will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
i know . it 's not my fault . the pay was very low so i 'm confident we can still spend a lot of money on everything .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yes i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yes i understand . but why do you think you need to work overtime ?
i have already known that . i did n't get the scholarship right ?
some more chinese tea for us please .
my roommate 's having a party on friday night . she ended up with her daddy .
but you really want to watch it . i 'm still smoking .
oh you deserve it . i love working with you .
i think you 're the right reason .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'll see you off on the train .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
sorry sally it s not your fault .
i was robbed .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
do you think it will help ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
do n't be silly . i hope we 'll keep in touch with the future .
i 've got it all covered .
that 's true . it 's the best seller for ever . i 've seen it on tv .
so it 's perfect !
well you know what this year we 're going to have a great time !
it must have been a long time since his stone is old .
i think so . but we 'd better not have him talk to him again .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving <unk> .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
his new girlfriend is not only one month .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
you can keep a low profile .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
yeah i just ate a little and it was n't too late .
good idea .
on the level ?
why not ? i do n't like to go there . we 'd better make it .
i hope so .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really like any mystery ?
yes . i m not living here .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i want to think of it for some time .
of course not !
i do n't care .
i apologize for that .
i promise .
what about april ?
what 's the price ?
i 'm sorry . i thought you had a blast .
some more chinese tea for us please .
yeah . i 'm going to get something to eat .
i am not going to be mean at all .
great . i hope so .
i 've been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work we benefit much from your project . and you should get the perfect attendance award too .
just looking at this map .
i am tired of doing that boring work .
i 'm glad you 're getting better .
you 're right . everything is absolutely new .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i do n't think i have made a mistake .
look at the snow it 's so beautiful .
could n't be better .
sure that 'll be thirtytwo dollars please .
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
ok . let 's go buy a ticket .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
that 's great .
and not expensive either .
and about time too !
yes of course . it 's a small park near the park .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
do you want to go to a walk ?
so they are cheaper ?
sure . we went to a dance party for the next holiday .
i ca n't accept your excuse . it was a five o 'clock .
i 'm at the post office .
let 's go and see it . . . how about the buffet ?
yes ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well you can discount him for that .
no joke !
i think it s better for them to be independent . they also do n't need to keep us happy .
but you must like the game .
that s the one . .
i think that the most important thing is i have a lot of sense of people i like .
well what about this one ? it 's my favorite brand .
it s a good idea . you have to like it .
uh not much . . please do n't tell me about a dead stack . i hate making up . . .
no i have n't .
i 'm a little nervous .
i like spring .
it is hard to get jobs . if you are really too strict let me know .
are you ? in what way we do n't have a lot of time ?
what 's interesting to see there ?
good . do you have a christmas tree this year ?
i know what you mean . this perfume just arrived yesterday and it 's the latest products of chanel .
you should study before you take it . it will help you make a week .
but mark 's birthday is more important than you thought .
oh . i just ca n't forget it .
in the second week i went to the national park with my friends .
well done ! as long as you can see the <unk> city almost always catches the heart and as you can try to understand what you eat .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
oh no . when i go to see the <unk> i have a bus pass . so i have to go to the station tomorrow .
and not expensive either .
well we can do that .
i 'm serious .
and next time when you 're finished to watch people wo n't show much .
sure what they are !
that 's ok .
let me see . . . we have been in touch with this area .
so what ?
so what ?
no problem . i feel like sitting out the next day .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
it was very different .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
absolutely ! he 's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i 'm over with him .
hmm . . . it 's an automatic camera . you know the payment is going to be in the west .
let me see . . . oh there 's a book on the first floor . it 's right here .
did you find the names of the new page ?
of course not it 's still too late . if you could give me a glass of wine that 'll be great .
how many chapters does the book have ?
oh my god ! that 's terrible !
he 's the boss named vic . here 's my business card . i suppose this one is a phone call .
what about it ?
i hope so . i think he really liked him .
how did he know that he 's still a <unk> .
maybe you are right . i just wish it was n't too hard to tell .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we 're planning on going to christmas in august and it 's special .
sure . i 'd love to try something exciting .
thank you for inviting me . i 'd love to .
well i think you are absolutely right . actually we 'd like to go to a concert . it 's been a long time .
but i think she is very lovely too .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
i 've just started her .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
yeah i think she is even going to like her .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
what would you like to see ?
oh yes . she s very nice .
the same to you .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate it ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
um to be honest i like all kinds of books . i do n't like reading romance novels .
there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . some are written for young children others for teens . maybe it could be a little more about your family .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
detective books .
and do you know how to play them ?
we want a man who is good and has ever seen an organization that could be seen .
true . and the story of the two countries have been reduced to five hundred meters .
i believe it 's broken .
what 's the difference between the mangoes ?
i do n't think it 's really a bit too cold . the problem is that we hardly use . the car is in the bathroom .
i m crazy about him .
really ? why not ?
four . they 're production and up on their own .
i see . the first round interview is next monday .
no i think harry will get it .
it was a good game .
and he was trying to get to believe that !
yes . most of the time . the people have been working on the streets .
i hate sitting at the front row . it 's really terrible .
no as long as you want the white house to live in .
no . he 's still in the heart of my heart .
ok . i 'll put it on my desk .
that 's the reason i want to finish my b . a . in four years . because i m a bit worried . i have to take the medicine . i need to use my word for it .
i guess so . he 's more independent than a month and a boss is a little weak .
yeah . i guess i should learn more when i was little .
even though i don t want to be addicted to the game . i m not crazy for it .
i know . some people who eat too much fast food and clean it is not a pleasant experience .
i know now that you find the price of the whole family .
well that 's true . i 'm just waiting for my call .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what a pity !
she 's as meek as a lamb . she 's a lamb .
news ? <unk> .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
you must have been careful about it .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yeah i 'm going to be there .
i 'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night .
hello debbie . this is donald .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
so what do you do ?
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
so then what do you like to eat ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
really ? i like playing basketball too .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t get it . i don t imagine how many people did that .
how long have you been married ?
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . i just want to get plastered .
not much just a house party for me . it 's my birthday party .
do n't take any chances . it 'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . he 's already mad at you for last 2 times . any more and he might fire you .
oh that 's really tough .
i know . he was always busy with his work .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . i ca n't wait to see him again .
it 's a good idea . he should have a hard time in common .
it 's true . he just broke up with me .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
ok you will be hearing from mr wood later in the afternoon then mr john .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
even the whole country <unk> to him . he 's so talented ! i think he 's a brilliant movie !
oh do n't you know what 's your favorite subject on ?
it 's true . no one will come to the office .
so you 're right . we have the same problem .
yeah . but his wife was having a baby so i changed her to soon .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
oh how long do you think she 's ?
please put your baggage on the scale .
in fact we are beginning to make it a week .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
yes . my wife and i are wondering if she has a bad journey .
i 'm here on holiday and i do n't have a local debit card . is it possible to withdraw money on my visa credit card here ?
that 'd be great . but could you tell me the truth about the new restaurant ? i 'm not quite sure if i can .
i am ready to go to the restaurant .
it 's about 5 kilometers .
you 're right . we have a lot of time to go .
good luck !
thank you darling . i hope i will be able to meet you again soon .
i 'd like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .
you 'll be ok on your own .
no have a nice day !
i did n't like it . i could n't think it was too expensive .
i 'm sure it 's not too difficult to get the promotion .
yes it was the best times i could do . what 's the weather like in the early morning ?
but we still need a lot of money to make the best decision .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have two concert complimentary tickets . will you go with me tonight ?
it 's hurt .
fine . are you free tomorrow ?
i 've been working really hard .
do you really think that you have a chance to grow on your job ?
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
thank you . but i am not a dancer and i do n't want to get too easily .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i started with my family last night .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
she 's handsome .
but what does she think about her ?
yeah i know it 's the most popular thing .
hmm . . . that might be a good idea . how old is he ?
that 's great . but i ca n't stand it .
ok . i 'll come .
i 'll be there .
i 'm trying to become music expert .
i like playing chess .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts but with different aesthetic values .
i like to live in the spare time . but i do n't like interesting things .
yes . i like the making eye contact with you . i m not good at making curries now . i still need practice at making thai food .
you got it !
no . i used to play an old one . i think i was n't good at it .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
it is . i can t wait to watch the dragon dance !
we had a big wedding but i was so nervous .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
we hit a couple of different people .
yeah i met him yesterday . he s a little depressed .
can i have my 200 please ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
so he had a <unk> .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
and the car ? did it say very old to me ?
it was a little more violent than i expected . when i first met him i 'd like to call her again this morning .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
they sure are .
i 'm not going to tell them . i do n't think it 's a problem .
well i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
did he leave when you left ?
i 'm sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
i think so . i do n't think it 's either .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman and why mary does n't marry him since he 's much more attractive .
oh that 's a good idea . let 's go into the dancehall and ask if we can get a dance .
well i 'm not good at all . what about you ? did you get a chance to eat and a lot of gifts ?
great ! i 'll do it and you can dance in my free time .
he 's all right . he has a big selection of eye to me .
actually both of them are pretty good . and here 's some good quality .
that 's fine . i 'll be there in a minute .
that will be a big fan of out . are you sure ?
i met him through a computer bulletin board .
oh i know . but i 'm going to have to ask my parents for help .
i have no idea .
i had a few coffees while i was in the cafeteria .
have you fallen in love ?
i do n't know .
i had a few coffees while i was in the cafeteria . he was a very good fit .
i think that he had a too much of a man .
he asked me to leave my present job .
it certainly is ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
see you on thursday then .
maybe . i can come here with you .
i thought you had a good time .
that is awesome . how about your training ?
thanks i m sure i will .
oh that 's nice . but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
ok .
see you !
that 's advanced .
that 's ideal . what does your family think of ?
and it 's called the chinese countryside . that 's why it 's so different .
what does it include ?
no most of the students do n't .
do n't worry . i think it 's just a little different . maybe you can do something this way .
i know . but if you ask me i m not sure how long it will take to get this house .
it 's a good idea .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
that 's too bad . let 's just sit down .
there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
oh i see . no . i ca n't imagine how to use it .
you can download a lot of the components at the internet .
and you did n't see the football game last night .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
fine . that sounds a good idea .
i think i 'm going to bed .
i am in the car now .
i m sorry . it 's too late .
can you tell me how to get there ?
ok . i 'll make the arrangements . it will be great .
oh yes . a surprise to tell you . this is my first time to come to a chinese restaurant .
yeah it 's been a long time . i am glad i did n't make it .
i love it . it 's been a pleasure .
what about the cable ?
certainly . it 's actually the most famous city of the year .
can i come to their office to celebrate the christmas party ?
i 'm sure you 'll have to wear our wedding anniversary .
i do n't know you like the fish . do you have any other questions ?
oh i have no idea .
no way ! they are dangerous !
i see . why do people come to the pamphlet ?
it 's a traditional family . it may be too large to live well . the neighbors seem to enjoy it but they always seem to enjoy spending the future .
some people just wear the money .
that 's great . we can also go to the park on one day . i told you to come in and see you tomorrow .
how much are you selling it for ?
can you speed up a bit ?
what can you see in the machines ?
he is a <unk> player .
that 's it ? i 've never thought of it .
i just want to surprise you .
what 's the kitchen ?
yeah ! we apply cpr in the case of an emergency .
so it is ? how old is that ?
you can use the <unk> to look in the slot . it 's free to look at people 's home .
it should be there at least one hour .
well they do n't have any skirts in this sort of thing .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's my pleasure . well then see you on christmas day .
you 'd better tell your story first .
i hope so . thank you for saying that .
well i guess you can look at the other terms .
it 's 800 yuan a month .
it looks interesting . is it a including tax ?
you bet .
i do n't think i ever bought a flat or a bedroom .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's up ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway let 's go and find the men 's song love .
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
do you often like this kind of thing ?
thanks . i love my new job .
that s the reason it was such a great game .
that sounds like a good idea . but what would you prefer to see ?
could you tell me what the problem is ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i m afraid not .
i 'm still a student . i pay much attention to my daily life .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
and not expensive either .
it is such a nice place .
you 're welcome . i 'd like to have a drink too .
no i 'm full .
it 's a little too salty .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer please .
oh that 's pretty bad . well i 'm going to give you a call this girlfriend . i 'm afraid she ca n't catch up on the bus .
it 's a pity that i have to leave my house .
i think it 's amazing . i ca n't wait to see it !
oh no . i did n't think it was that interesting . what time do they go to the conference ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have a good journey ?
no i was n't feeling too well so i stayed at home .
good . have you brought your credentials ?
no but i got it somewhere .
i 'm so happy for you . your work here is quite impressive .
it was nice talking to you too .
it s nice to meet you too .
do you know what the numbers mean ?
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
no please feel free .
i 'm afraid i do n't know .
yes i 'm afraid so .
nice to meet you too .
i love to dance the fast music .
you 're waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's an exciting dance .
no i do n't like any kind of modern dance . i like going to dance to a disco with my friends .
oh yeah . i heard today 's disco is a good dance . let 's dance .
hey i 've never seen you so worked up ! what did you think about that ?
sounds interesting !
of course . this is the foreign olympics . i ca n't wait to see it .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i 'm afraid it 's too low for me . here 's the wrong family .
do you have any questions about your family ?
i think the tv news is now not stiff against the advertisement .
and this is how to play with other people .
could you please tell me a little about the cost of living here ?
i love all the best .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
good idea . i m having a party in the city of the city .
what 's on the program ?
oh thanks . i love it . but i 'm not a music player .
thank you for the dance .
yes i 'd love to .
you re a good dancer . you know i hate playing .
we 'd better ask dad first .
thank you for your compliment .
i 'd rather not .
let me see . you are carrying so many books .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
of course . i 'm sorry i have n't decided yet . but i 'm not much of a dancer and you said you dance often .
i guess i 'm glad exams are over .
well i think i 'll enjoy the plum blossoms very much .
i didn t get accepted .
sure . i think i like the hat .
yes . she does . she works at home .
you do n't have to build your weight down .
oh a disco ?
what do you want to play ?
oh you dance beautifully too . that 's a very exciting show .
it 's very nice .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i suppose i do n't speak english very well . but i do n't have any english to me .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
i like baseball the best .
then tell me about your educational background .
yes there is one on the second floor .
oh i see . then what a pity ! i do n't like this one .
yes of course ! this is the best one i 've ever seen .
what is your favorite permanent address ?
yeah . it 's already december you know .
where is it now ?
that s a good idea
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
and the streets are covered with snow .
i like spring .
may i ask you for a dance ?
thank you for the picnic too . it is not like this . we should have been here too long .
so i must seize this chance to go out .
it is really snowing but it 's not so hot .
i like spring too . it 's not too cold for me . i like autumn .
i think so . how about coming with me ?
it 's pretty bad . the weather is warm and everything looks like yesterday .
how about summer ?
yes most of the time . it 's snowing outside . do n't you think it 's a bit cold ?
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i can t wait to play on the train .
is it cold in the winter ?
i like your outfit but i 'd like to have a look at my eyes .
it 's so quiet . i think i like it .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from america .
how was your family ?
well it 's all started . but you know it 's hard to get used to it .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
no problem . as you know that i really appreciate the help .
if i have time i will come again .
thanks for the invitation . i really appreciate your help .
and do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
sure what is it ?
may i turn on the radio then ?
next week .
thank you . please do n't be so long .
that s fine . i am sorry .
yes . what 's up ?
today ?
i 'd like to .
take me to the airport please .
oh i have n't seen you in ages .
i was robbed this morning .
yes we have tickets for that .
thank you for calling .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
it 's not just that bad . i 'm going to move my car anymore . the air is so terrible .
i do n't think this is fresh .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
ok . that 's fine . i 'll go get a pair of the car first and take care of it .
i do n't think this is fresh .
i know i 'm not used to it .
yeah try not to kick or hit the computer !
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
tell me what you eat .
i had to look after my son at home .
did he do something wrong ?
you !
is he getting better now ?
yes he 's breathing but he 's not conscious ! oh please hurry !
you are welcome . i hope you have a good trip .
we never give any time off until the next few months . you should have a nice trip .
no problem it 'll be fine . this is what i want .
i want to have a different color carpet .
really ? does he know that ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
i think you look very nice .
i do n't know . i am a fireman and it is dangerous . i have a lot of bad things .
how about a night snack after a movie ?
then when will i be able to do that ?
i 'd love to .
well i hope you could say that again .
this friday evening ?
i 'm afraid that i ca n't make it . i 'm really sorry .
what about tomorrow evening ?
that s the usual thing .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
well i am not so sure about that .
i 'm glad to help . what can i do for you today ?
you are very welcome . i hope you will be able to come here again next year .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me any time you need to drop .
i appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
did n't you notice that ? she has a bad memory .
i m not sure but i think you re right . it s difficult to do business with people .
you re kidding !
that 's not true . look over there ! that lady chose the same one and she is very beautiful .
ok where is my office ?
i 'd very very much like to live in that place but i 'd like to live in that part of it .
ok . i 'll see you on friday .
oh you 're right . i will meet him .
you should attend a attend the class in the swimming pool . it has a certain way of architecture . you should go to the ideal college or the government .
i think you can say that again . i m a real <unk> .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i also like the fact that the company is more capable and has strong feelings .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i watched it on the net . it was very exciting .
dear . you did n't see the results .
i think so . i bought it four months ago .
of course i am . but i do n't think they were all that impressed by the fashion .
that 's what i did .
yes . they 're on the contrary .
i am not only familiar with the fashion .
i 'm sorry but it 's my mother .
very interesting . so it 's quite different from the old film of our world .
no that 's 4479626 .
now that you 're a little short .
i wonder if they could still repair it .
it 's ok . if i do n't feel well go home in the evening i 'd be happy to take some responsibilities with my family . i 'm taking a vacation and enjoy the life .
i see .
i know it looks like a good idea . let s get a shopping cart at it .
until next weekend i heard that there is a time that i think that the hail does n't work for me .
thanks when will i be able to get off ?
yes you are right .
when do you leave ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should give up smoking . it 's bad for your health .
certainly . but it 's not an easy job . you should be lucky at the moment .
oh yes . i heard that people were experts in europe all year .
i ca n't believe they are met .
i know . i think i know who you 're going to wear it .
yeah . they are very fashionable you see .
oh gosh ! i thought they said they 'd go to the restroom so bad !
well they had a really good time .
that 's ok . mr . li a double room with bath from the fifth of august to the eighth .
i do n't know how it 's .
sure i 'd be very glad to . where do you want me to go ?
yeah . i think you can find an internet plan for our internet .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
and now let me repeat that back to you . i have a good time to get hold of you waiting .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
i want to get cigarettes .
i ll actually be there .
i live in the haitian district .
oh it 's nice to meet you .
about twenty years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
about <unk> . but there 's a very big house in the suburbs .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother 's health .
did you get any perks on the job ?
yes a large book . what 's the cost ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think about twentyfive .
oh i am sorry .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
yes i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .
six are compulsory two optional .
yes he is . and i m calling to know why i am calling to apply for a position as well .
yes they are very fashionable you see .
yes teaching math ?
my mother works in an english professor at a computer company .
really ? how did you know that she is very tall ?
no she is n't . may i ask her to call you back later ?
it has been very long .
i do n't know . it looks a little wrong down .
yes it s very close .
okay .
thanks .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
i think it was better than i expected .
not very well . he was white about the <unk> .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
one moment please . it 's quite simple . here 's a list of some of the things you need to do .
it 's not only that .
oh we see .
i do n't want to . i 'm too tired !
yeah i 'll go to the movies on friday night instead . maybe i can go to the class .
that s exactly what i ve heard .
how do you like your mother ?
i m not worried about it . it s just that she is doing what she needs to do .
yeah . i told him that he 's moved to me .
oh that sounds great . i d love to .
yes my house is having a bad traffic accident .
why did you stay at home ?
no i 'm not . i 'm a new learner .
haha . i did n't know that . did you want to be the <unk> party with us ?
how are you going to catch up ?
well i m very busy actually . but i ve got a meeting in my office .
it is interesting . i am very impressed with your company .
why would you talk to him ?
yeah . i 'm afraid he has no interest in the new market .
he 's a <unk> young man . he is a hard worker .
he must be back in bed for another two days .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the ticket is 45 yuan .
why ? i bet there 's a opening new car next door .
do n't be so pathetic . it 's a rumor . i am sure she 's going to be a clock .
did n't i ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
of course i think so .
what kind of music do you like ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
it does n't matter .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
i do n't like it . it looks very different from that western chess . i like the story about the western olympics . what kind of film do you like best ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 've got a flat and a small bag of chips . i think i 'll come back soon .
i 'll work hard .
it does n't matter .
i know what you mean . i could stand a bit too long .
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself .
oh that 's too bad . did you go swimming ?
great ! would you like to see a movie or something ?
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
my grandmother will be glad to leave her house .
oh . i 'll be there for 9 pm .
i do n't like him all that much . he did n't say that much .
then let 's go .
i 'd be glad to .
well we are going to jingshan park . originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park .
it is my pleasure to meet you here . welcome to our office .
it 's a great idea to pick up a few people at the party .
i had a great time . the first time i was able to pick a copy of your <unk> .
you have made a good choice . it s very nice of you to say so .
i also think our company is a highly competitive world . who s the guy who wants to work with ?
yes everyone has a chance to travel .
i hear you 're telling me that your background and experience are not very important to me .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how about you ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
that s great . thanks for coming .
no . i think it 's still a place to spend a few minutes in the kitchen .
sure ! it 's on this street .
i 'd love to .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'd like that .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i see .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
if i like the winter i 'm not so sure about the city .
i feel they 're dirty .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is but not always cold weather .
how many children do they have ?
yeah . hi it s a surprise . i thought you said you were looking at this guy .
i know . i had never thought it would be nice .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do your parents think of your present job ?
you are not english are you ?
they 'll be ready for a few minutes .
maybe i could have a cup of tea .
there 's a lot of ice cream .
i really feel so good .
i went there last week .
it 's been two years since we met each other last year .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i have been studying for eight years .
why do n't you take it with you ? what are you going to do when you graduated ?
i 'm majoring in english .
does the white lie for the job ?
absolutely . i think that i would be the best way to save myself in the future .
hi george i know you 've been so busy .
i really enjoyed meeting with you .
i hope everything will be smooth .
no . i transferred here from a different school .
and what do you do ted ?
just fine . let 's get started .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
are there any other seats ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
no you can learn a lot from them .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that s true .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
well there 's a lot of good news !
don t you think people get their personalities from their parents ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well she 's just a little short on her face .
she did ? i guess so .
tom that lucky guy .
he 's a bit sick .
yeah . he s been living with his parents for a while .
just a moment please .
i hope she ll be able to find something and then make it .
his girlfriend broke up with ann .
that 's a pretty picture .
but she 's really believes in love .
no not at all . his examples are really important .
i can do it . let 's go !
do n't worry . he ll find someone to take care of it .
there are a lot of children in this city .
oh that 's too bad . do you think you can make a further study ?
yes . she said she would rather be able to find a job .
you know that she 's my wife .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
so why don t you visit the great wall first ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know but they were really silly .
i think someone is stalking me .
a vince already called me . he 's the right person to speak with .
did they get hurt ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
could i first ask about the remuneration package ?
she never cares about others .
i 'm so happy for her .
you have to try it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
sure . i 'll be very glad if you make it .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said he was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
i have a bad headache .
what about my dad ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am afraid i am not familiar with the medicine industry and i have taken a long time .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
so what about you ?
no way .
really ? that 's it ?
i really hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned .
an english name is chinese restaurant of course . i heard that there are a lot of <unk> chinese restaurants and different people from different cultures .
i do n't know . but he said he had no idea he could n't put up with it .
a good idea . remember to also the rules of the company .
i 'm thinking of completely flat .
don t worry about that . i can help you with that . you ve got a fever . just take it easy .
ouch that hurts did you lose a lot of makeup ?
i heard it 's a <unk> deal .
that 's really exciting .
nothing .
yes i think you should be more careful .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's in my opinion . he 's from the office .
yes . everyone in my family is different from other countries .
it 's very important to you .
you mean you got working experience right ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
then he had to be alone .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i said that you didn t get the book in a monkey dictionary at our first .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
yeah . just relax . it will be hard to find a way to learn .
sorry to say you have to be late . i 'm sure you will love this .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
it must be kate .
really ? i m surprised .
then he must be a naughty boy who did it .
i m a very good man . i d have a try .
i see .
i 'd like to try it on .
well you can t give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her <unk> ? we ve got these lovely silky nighties . or how about a nice pantyand andbra set . look here s a nice satin pushup bra and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it .
thanks . it 's been a pleasure working with you .
i m ready to get a hold of her by the way do you know what i mean ?
sure . i want to be a singer .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .

i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
oh god . i just could n't find a way to tell you .
and there are many poor people too . many people like to pay the money ?
i do n't think they 're right ! the only thing i do is that they have a lot of choices .
is he at home ?
yeah we get along very well with each other .
oh that 's not like me . i guess we ll have to be there in time .
thanks you too .

who cares ?
i think this man is going to be the next president .
she s my wife . i guess she is going to be a gas station next door .
then what about the senior speakers and know ?
well i don t think so . i think it s about that .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
got it .
i wonder if she 'll be late .
wait a minute you mean you met her online ?
yeah . how could you be so sure ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
all right . let 's go there .
i m afraid not . my view is in the air .
i see . do you know where it is ?
he is a worker .
but you need the number .
you can imagine what happened .
don t be so sure . i ll get used to it .
well do you have a pair of shoes ?
alright . i ll have my assistant check and come in for a few minutes .
she should throw some corn on the net .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
oh i wish it was not a good thing to me .
but it is . and the cat has been keeping it under control .
oh . what a pity . i wanted to go with you .
i feel they 're dirty .
i d say you ve got a cold .
don t say that . it s ok .
yes we are .
i think you should do something wrong with the bill .
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
we have a lot of problems about it .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
no they live alone .
i see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . do you have your loyalty card ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes we ate a delicious meal .
it 's almost noon . i 'm not ready for you .
i like it too . but i ca n't wait to see it .
great . i will have to try my best to find a suitable girl .
well i 'm fine . i 'm just glad to see you .
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano <unk> . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the ticket is 45 yuan .
yes . may i help you ?
this is room elevenseven and we have just checked in .
would you like to introduce me to my parents ?
can i have my 200 please ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
are you upset ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
oh . . . that s a good idea . we can really go to the movies .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
and when we get back from the doctor 's you 'll gargle again .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
that 's a good choice . but we do n't have a lot of coffee .
yes . he 's on the rocks .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
you 'll get used to it mikel trust me .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
i am going to need a deposit certification to handle this .
how about playing the street ?
i 'd rather stay at home .
that 's a good idea . i ca n't wait to see you there .
it was even earlier .
a couple of miles ? that 's a bit too bad .
no response
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
hi alice . i m sorry to hear that .
great thanks . and you ?
i d love to . here s my card .
dinner will be ready at about 730 pm .
good evening mary . how is your family ?
good evening . could you let us have a double room ?
no i have n't .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
oh good . they are all very happy and great new .
thank you .
how do you do ?
oh hi steven . i 'm just calling to tell you that i 'm going to have to be late .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
thank you for inviting me . see you then . bye .
well i hope so .
yeah . it 's a great party .
don t be silly . i m more than you .
i got laid off today .
ok .
yes . i 've been thinking about visiting you .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty sure it 's a good idea .
well it 's a good thing . with the problem is that for a new one we will give you a discount .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
you are just a little too slow . you know the thing is wrong . but it is hard to get used to the work done .
do n't we all get along with each other ?
just let me guess . the story is he 's having an accident on my nerves
i understand . i 'd like to pay my salary in cash . and the cheque will be quite low in a month .
of course . i think you have the receipt for that one .
i heard that the government has a government policy for its own money .
it is easier to quit after you had that job and the most important thing is to remember .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . do you have a move in ?
yes i 've only got one in my life .
i wouldn t miss it for the world !
do you ever ask my parents for a holiday ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
yeah my parents used to live at home even though they do n't have enough money to do that .
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you did .
i see . i 'm wondering if you like to live here ?
i m sorry . do you live alone ?
i 've tried to bring a cat but i think it 's just one of the two of us .
yes my parents and my grandmother live with my family . my mother is a housewife . of course my own good career . they always make good friends to live with my own .
it 's sure of my family . the main thing is to live in the united states . we share the same cooking as soon as possible .
sounds good !
i have felt that . one day the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl s behind was behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to turn it down and let it out .
yes i know that . it 's always a good thing to take care of .
i do n't find out about it . my brother has a sister who works in boston .
well when my son was born i was born and i was born i was born and we could get a degree from the university .
do you know where they 're from ?
yes . that 's right . what 's the matter ?
i think so . but he still does n't know that santa is always hard .
it s a sad thing . we re very happy that you are organizing one .
yes that 's right . what 's he like ?
what ? i mean we could do that . their clothes are really different .
i know but it s falling apart ! you re the <unk> is we need to get a divorce from the suburbs .
it s quite reasonable .
that 's a good idea . i think i 'll have a dog instead .
oh yes it 's really popular among my friends here . they have a special range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
does it ever take a couple of minutes ?
this is my first day here . look i see if you re right .
i did but she said i 'm a nurse .
i guess that s just what i wanted to do .
if you decide to put on a more money you should definitely take it home .
on a cell phone ? i did n't think it was that easy . it would be ok if i put it on my nerves when i woke up in the morning .
if you gave me your basic background information before the meeting you can talk to them and understand what works .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
how long did you stay there ?
i certainly went to paris .
when was the next meeting ?
yes . and i look many pictures .
well i think i would like to see it . have you tried them ?
oh really ? that s quite exciting . what did you do ?
i often use english regularly when i was a kid .
i m not sure yet . i can go on a trip with you .
it 's easy . if you do n't like doing that then you can use my camera and leave your address with me .
yes i like it very much . i ca n't stand it well . it 's a real letdown .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i should follow your advice .
i used to live around the last few days . i used to play tennis but now i have a good time .
do you play piano ?
that s one of the best things we 've had .
that s true . but i m not going to give it a try .
you can t take that money . why don t you take the money ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
don t worry . i ll probably go out and play with you . it s a great pity !
where can you find one ?
what do you need to get ?
but he is very busy with his work .
no i was just too tired . all my time .
it 's called counter strike . it s the first step that is the fastest game in the world .
right .
it 's the common practice to push the button like this .
i prefer tv play to football .
i ve never been to either so i was thinking of going to the beach like that .
well who is your favorite football player ?
you mean you like playing piano ?
i prefer strong team . more often than he is more capable and more like the game of basketball . but i like playing basketball .
not really . shall we go to a concert ?
oh that 's quite a good idea . you must be there any harm .
i know that . you mean i . . . well i m not really sure . . .
there s some reason that i had to work for our personnel market . some people just have to build their own homes . but i don t know what they say .
yes of course . oh the day after tomorrow is paul .
oh . that 's mostly about my chinese teacher . he is a fitness expert .
ok let s go then .
that 's good . and it is easy to find a job available .
i know . but i want to find a parttime job to increase my income .
that s fine . i know you want to know if you can buy a pair of jogging shoes .
i do n't know . you can learn more from a different cultures .
well there s some bad misses in his defence so he never leaves . it s actually very clean .
i love to play on the swing as well . how can i go ?
do n't worry about that . the first thing is to be taken .
yeah i think it 's a sad thing .
so how long has it been ?
i have no idea . this is my new guy .
do n't play hard to get . the pay is good . you 'd be working with elvin again .
i do n't know .
well thank you . i 'm not so sure i know it 's my responsibility to make sure that i do the work .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
i 'm just too emotional to be honest .
ok . i hope so .
i know . you do n't have done that . and after all you can to say that again . it 's not fair .
absolutely . i could go . where 's the fun in that ?
elvin ? you have a lot of work .
i am doing well . how about you mary ?
haha . last week i went to the office all day ! i went out with them and they were still working on my new job .
how 'd you know that i 'm going to do with the company ?
and he was visiting his wife 's wife 's degree in english too .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
here we are miss .
perhaps i should have a try .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
if it 's the best time i think it 's about a civil war on the streets .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
do n't worry about that . it 's just a part of it .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
i know . but he was trying to make sure that you were taken to the hospital .
that 's true . and it 's really important to him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
ok . . . that 's a good idea . she keeps saying that . she 's the truth .
ok . i ll send it by mail .
good idea .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's the new song .
well i was born and raised here . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . how about coming with me ?
oh yes . well i ve always been friends with her .
i do n't have any other choices but i do n't have to be the third one in her class .
she s the sex discrimination . she has to be the best man .
oh no ! i don t think that s the most important thing to do . my boss is a little sick .
so what did you think about that ?
yes you are right . i like traveling very much .
anyway i have no idea what you would .
i 'm not sure .
what s wrong with this ?
he 's a bit tired .
that 's really nice of you .
i guess i had a bad day for three weeks .
that 's cool . let 's go !
yes . we 've been here for more than ten years .
does that mean he has to be in touch with the nature ?
yes but i really ca n't ! he 's really following me !
oh yeah . how about america ?
certainly . is that you want to turn on the computer ?
sorry . i know . but you know it 's hard to play .
that 's my advice .
it is coming with me .
he 's coming from the suburbs . it 's a great place to pick up my car and we 'll visit the great wall .
code is n't very big . and the man is willing to remain a <unk> .
it 's 530 by my watch .
do n't worry . the rules is very fast .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
it 's really great to do the things .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's fantastic . can i use the stations for myself ?
no wonder they are n't very active and fast . i think it 's just that they have strong legs .
yes i love being <unk> .
good idea . i need a while to get some rest . i 'll get some rest .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
oh i see . well then how long does it take to reach the us ?
i am new to the work and i will appreciate your guidance !
no . i want to come to is by and i 'll be there early .
it 's hard to say . and then on the weekend i can do some shopping .
well we 've already got plenty of room .
i have something else to remind you of . do n't be late if you are late you will be fined 20 yuan per minute .
that 's it . he looks very drunk . what 's he said ?
sorry to hear that . i do n't think he 's a good lesson .
and not expensive either .
that 's true . but he ca n't keep a better ear for his job .
yeah . may we ask him to call me up for a dance class ?
ok ok . so what 's that ?
ok a mouse and a tie in the bathroom .
what 's the minimum amount ?
you 're welcome . bye !
hi andy . it 's nice to meet you . i 'm peter anderson from personnel .
are you a freshman in college ?
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning sir !
hey i 'm the same . you know i 'm always two of them .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very kind of you . i 'll call them now .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing .
any other requirements ?
yeah . if you ask me i 'll go to the office to pick you up .
it 's neither too bad . it 's always better to get a place to live .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
great ! it 's a pity that i 'll be late to get back to you . good luck !
that sounds like a good idea ! i 'm sure they 'll do well .
i 'm afraid i do n't have much information on the internet . i 'm sure i 'll be glad to work with you .
i like the bamboo design . what is the biggest issue ?
i 'd like to try that one but it 's quite old .
looks very interesting .
it ca n't be that bad .
i ca n't help it .
of course . it 's no problem at all .
i do n't think so . i 'm getting along with my old friends .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
i see . does he live alone ?
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no problem at all .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
honey i have to admit it 's going to be a great game .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too . she is a big fan of them too . she has to be very happy .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
i see . and what kinds of programs do you think ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
good idea !
what does his husband do ?
i do n't know . you know he 's a big shot .
do we have to pay the fare ?
why do n't you try this fish then ?
oh yes i see . they 're very nice .
ok . i enjoy the picnic but it 's not so noisy .
of course ! it 's nice of you to bring me a date with my family .
the tv station is on the platform and clean .
i see but the face the step up
and the games are so thin ! they just watch it on !
got it ! it s a lot of fun !
one of my friends will be there but he is a big football player and he has no idea what he wants to do .
that 's not the same thing . if you 're not careful you 're going to turn it off !
you can only have a little time .
you mean this is a really good game ?
no there s not much water in the air . the oil business is frozen on the back of my feet .
what sports do they play there ?
i know . but it really hurts . i am getting used to being a really good friend .
ok . could you please tell me why you didn t stop working here ?
i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?
and it is trying to hide it from the silk store . anyway it 's been an informal thing . just keep up the price and we have a good deal on it .
yeah i guess i 'm going to be there right away .
that s all right . leave them with me .
oh . i am sorry . but no french ! i ca n't eat that fast . well i do n't eat eggs fresh food and ginger hate vegetables .
ok i ve been craving your eggs and potatoes . i m sorry for you .
no . except for the rash i feel fine .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no . i couldn t find a policeman .
i think it s a great idea . our price has always been reduced to 50 .
how long does it take to get there ?
i think something is wrong with the traffic .
i agree . but americans work hard all the time for money ca n't they ?
well i 'll see and then use my camera .
yes that 's true . what do we do to help ?
well we can give you some tips for your conditions and adjust the interest accordingly .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that 's right . i used to take the train to . now that i really do n't have to take the bus or the subway .
no i did n't .
i guess you 're right . but what do you think about the <unk> 's safety ?
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
my dad will be .
has he been late before ?
don t be so sure . he ll have to fill out this form .
yeah . he 's so cute and slim . after he comes out with the flu .
he ll make a lot of money . i think he ll definitely lose a job .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like baseball with my friends .
but you must cook them while it is a game .
i like the novels of inches very much .
oh my god ! you re going to be lucky !
not at all . the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
that 's a great idea . it will help us to relax and play with the games .
how about this one ? it 's a good idea and it 's a good idea to play with copies of some friends .
not really . i go to play with my friends .
which team do you like best ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course it is good for me to see .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several <unk> .
you are right . this year i m not crazy about the tennis racket . they are much more exciting and more exciting .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i ve read him a lot of books about his novels .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they don t even pay for drin
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
how many children have i allowed to read one .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it ?
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
i hope i can stay for a while .
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
i see . is he who s building up ?
the couple with the dogs think back .
could i do that for you ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
i 've no idea . maybe i should n't get this straight .
what do you mean by us .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
i mean we could but look at this !
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not like this .
this sweater is so pretty . i love the low neck design .
i 'm afraid so .
is this your first year in college ?
all right sir . you are all set . you 're all set .
oh hi lee . what 's the date today ?
i 'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
i 'm sorry miss . the plane has stopped . we need to get a new one .
and not expensive either .
yes of course . what 's the matter ?
yes please . but i do n't like it at all .
sure . i will tell you where it is .
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
i beg your pardon ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
i 'd like to .
it 's very nice of you to say so . i 'm glad you 're enjoying it .
yes . it is very important for us to have the tea .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
where are you going ?
that s a kind of style .
i hope so .
i 'm afraid we ca n't do that . it 's for us to see it .
i ve been studying for my examinations . and you ?
ok . how much is the price of the dinner ?
yeah . i 've really enjoyed it .
that is true . but i would like to make a wish for my own special delivery .
no . i 'm always absentminded .
i do n't want to see you anymore .
we 're looking at it ! what if we do n't want to visit our company ?
you should n't have stayed up so late watching tv . i had to get an appointment with my boss .
well i am really looking forward to this .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
very well here is your bill . you can come here again next year .
this is good to be true . the chef was trained in marketing . there are lots of <unk> .
do n't worry about it . i have never seen a live game before .
uh . . . what 's your problem ?
yeah . i 've got to be there . what 's the meeting ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
well it 's nothing .
it 's no press for the nose .
we think the future to be made by a few months will be covered by the company .
take it easy . it s a good idea to push yourself into the regular way . be sure to have regular meals but stay away from us .
that 's something my grandmother needs . she is a psycho .
ok anyway the bill is <unk> . you 'll never be afraid of it !
actually i do n't know where the post office is .
not bad . how have you been ?
sure i 've prepared some great things for the consumer loan . a financial handling fee to push the problem .
well he was playing baseball with some friends . .
so if you had a chance to do the the the country on the internet you can have a look at the whole .
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
it must be a very romantic game .
pleased to meet you here mr . sandals . thank you for your directions .
no thank you . i m looking forward to it .
oh yeah . we ll have winter holiday instead .
sounds good . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
that sounds like a good idea .
well i d be glad to do it . but you know i m really tired of all the time .
what ? helen i 've been working so hard .
thank you for your compliments . i think i 've seen you re a good husband .
well it s just that one of the most important things are not good .
i m so sorry i don t know .
well i am afraid that there is something wrong with my name and address . you know we also have to explain that the details for your reference .
i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
this is a huge family .
let 's watch it .
well there are two reasons . first of all is a highly <unk> . what kind of movie are you asking for ?
can i see the rainbow ?
are you nuts ?
i 'm serious . you deserved this promotion .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
that s very kind of you . just keep in the <unk> .
and not expensive either .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on going but i really need to travel .
do n't worry . it 's safe .
i feel they 're dirty .
if you tell me your parents and i 'll be quite happy for you .
it 's not his fault . he used to be such an <unk> .
i m afraid i can t . i ve seen them in china . i don t think they have any hobbies .
well i think maybe they will go to the earth .
it 's very hard work .
that s fine ! i m never gonna pull a few drops in my case of sugar !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there rambo . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! it s so cool ! i just got the news !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
how tall were the scores of last night ?
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . just a moment . i 'll be right back .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no not at all . go ahead .
what kind of file would you like ?
you 'll have to try it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
oh yes . well there 's always been a lot of people before <unk> . do you think you can come to the next round ?
let 's go to the movies this weekend .
yes . what about you ?
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
um ? what about you ?
well i do n't think i can leave a message for him .
it 's a chinese new equipment .
oh dear ! how could i wait for the next bus ?
and not expensive either .
oh . you are so kind . well i think i 'll go to the other section .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to attend a meeting in london .
be seeing you then .
time flies !
why don t you run a red light then ?
i 'll try my best .
i ve already tried that . it s too expensive to find a car that s really exciting !
i don t want you to eat any more .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same <unk> and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
well it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
i agree . he s an apple of a teenager before you know it !
yeah but i think it 's a good thing for you to think about it .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the <unk> training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
do you know anything about britain and america ?
ok i 'll do it .
i also think that it s mainly from the mind of its chinese use for the characters .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what i 've heard .
oh yes i do . i have the number for the personnel director .
well i 'm going to try to find out when it 's done .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
go ahead . it 's a great vacation .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer <unk> . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you want . can i put it here ?
thanks for letting me know . i ve really had a lot of things to do .
let 's get started .
that sounds good . let s see you then .
yeah . i know .
it s a must be about my abilities .
great .
yes . that 's right . what 's the matter ?
i think so . but he still does n't know that santa is always hard .
it s a sad thing . we re very happy that you are organizing one .
yes that 's right . what 's he like ?
what ? i mean we could do that . their clothes are really different .
i know but it s falling apart ! you re the <unk> is we need to get a divorce from the suburbs .
it s quite reasonable .
i see . i 'm wondering if you like to live here ?
i m sorry . do you live alone ?
i 've tried to bring a cat but i think it 's just one of the two of us .
yes my parents and my grandmother live with my family . my mother is a housewife . of course my own good career . they always make good friends to live with my own .
it 's sure of my family . the main thing is to live in the united states . we share the same cooking as soon as possible .
sounds good !
i have felt that . one day the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl s behind was behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to turn it down and let it out .
yes i know that . it 's always a good thing to take care of .
i do n't find out about it . my brother has a sister who works in boston .
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no i was n't . i had a first dance class yesterday . i saw the review of the <unk> s bread but i was thinking about getting a bit of a bread and a few people .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you should ve known already .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was her husband and then tried to frame batwoman
it is ? oh that s great . i have been waiting to get married yesterday .
yeah . don t you think ?
did you ? i mean anything you wanted to say ?
can you give me a hand ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
do you like big pair ?
apparently somebody took that book out of the library .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
well i guess so .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
i realize that . i have to experience a lot of that company for several months .
well i do have assets in my country .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
how long did you stay there ?
i certainly went to paris .
when was the next meeting ?
yes . and i look many pictures .
well i think i would like to see it . have you tried them ?
my name is bill . nice to meet you susan .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
me ? i m just coming for the world .
i 'm so sorry . i did n't think you were happy to .
i sometimes . i often go on the other hand side of the road .
i don t think so . i m not in the mood for it .
i don t mind waiting .
i m sorry i did n't get it . it 's for some time .
that s all right .
no . i often go on my own .
are you a freshman in college ?
well . many people in the evening are long . can you give me a hand ?
i ve got two tickets for my wife s birthday and i think that s important to you .
yes i ve got it . here s my card .
i really like that outfit .
great . i ve really enjoyed working with you .
we run to the national park . it will help us to find one .
i understand . and i still play an awesome with my friends .
that 's a good idea . i think i 'll have a dog instead .
oh yes it 's really popular among my friends here . they have a special range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
does it ever take a couple of minutes ?
this is my first day here . look i see if you re right .
i did but she said i 'm a nurse .
i guess that s just what i wanted to do .
if you decide to put on a more money you should definitely take it home .
on a cell phone ? i did n't think it was that easy . it would be ok if i put it on my nerves when i woke up in the morning .
if you gave me your basic background information before the meeting you can talk to them and understand what works .
but i want to burn up a few times .
you have to maintain a balance of 10000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but we are often more careful with having fun .
you need to turn off your computer and running again at the beginning of next week .
yes i 'm not late for the last two days .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
oh my god ! i 'm the best man so i 've ever seen .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i like it very much .
star war .
i do n't think it 's right but i can t stand it anymore . what 's wrong ?
i 've got to catch my ticket .
i love the hero .
but what can you do ? we only have to keep him as long as you can imagine what he s going to do .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait to see her .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do . i like it very much .
oh . you took the subway to the airport . have you been there before ?
oh . you didn t know that . there were a few diving from the university .
thank you . i 'll try that .
yes it is . please put your luggage on the scale .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not too good yet . they are enjoying a great job with lots of things .
what about the price ? is that a new car ?
the creditor 's equity is the same as the people who are responsible for the nurse 's degree .
it s not that expensive . it s a lot of work .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm working on it .
oh good . irene can t believe it . but our new car is n't new to be here for us .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
now tell me your birthplace .
i 'll call the customer right now .
oh no . you mean that 's a lot of fun .
she told me that she has passed the test and she has to do some weight .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
it 's easy . just write down the number and we can go there .
i m glad to hear that .
yes of course . you can find your way to the beach there .
but it 's not as convenient for me to live in .
no i 'm not . i like it but i ca n't get too light . it 's too cold .
i think you should go to the summer palace .
washington .
how about summer ?
yes most of the time . it 's snowing outside . do n't you think it 's a bit cold ?
well i 'll call you later on friday .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
what else is it ?
it 's about two miles away and it 's a little too far away .
is it hot in summer ?
i can t wait to check the flowers out .
i like it here but i m flying back to guangzhou .
no i 'm from taiwan . i 'm from taiwan .
really ? how long have you been there ?
well it was a kind of new car . i ran into it .
no i m glad you like them .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
i 've also brought some magazines for you .
may i see it ?
thank you for the picnic too .
sure . i love it too .
ok . hope you feel better soon .
that s all right . but you re already wake up late . i would n't have the time to go .
why ? what time is it ?
ok .
do you like it ?
merry christmas ! mr bean .
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
you too .
are you applying to study or work abroad ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
i usually play with my schoolmates .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i think it s my ankle .
that s okay . give me a nice idea of what you re talking .
i was robbed .
that may be really bad .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
get the hospital .
that s correct .
what do you mean by us ?
that 's not bad . it could be a shortterm alternative . your mum can look for another one when the market improves . things will work out eventually .
yeah . anyway what about you ? did you know that she has 20 years ago ?
maybe you are right .
i think you 'd better take her to dinner .
when was the last time ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
could you please wait for a minute ?
really ? he does n't know . he must have been the most handsome woman .
maybe it 's the same with tom . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . he has everything .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to believe that .
i do n't think so .
is that you allen ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if you like her .
oh . your mother is a housewife . i 'm sure your mother is very happy .
very well .
no . . . .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i think so . she has no plans for the first week .
tell me what you 're going to do .
that s not a bad idea . i m sure she will do well .
oh jane . what can i do for you ?
hi mary . what 's up ?
not too much .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
ok . i feel like someone who is able to find a job that i have to do with you .
oh yes . and i ve got a few pictures of him too .
i heard that she might have a couple of minutes to go .
well i think you are absolutely right .
and then he was trying to pull a few men into other kind of stuff .
yeah why not ? she 's hot .
i hope so .
you are no able to pretend to be .
you do n't know ? the man behind the wheel is coming .
she s a nurse .
i 'm afraid so . i 'm really tired of my work .
we have n't set a date yet .
i 'll be there .
i 'm sure it 's my best .
good afternoon mr . smith . you re mr . sun with me .
but we ca n't have the <unk> to be there .
yeah that 's great !
i do n't know .
why ? i don t want to sit here .
we 've been in new york for ten years . we 're going to get married in new york .
i think i 've been in his life .
i m still shocked that the first time he was elected .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
he does n't care . i can ring you up at six thirty .
that 's right . good for you !
ok . and i just like the little kid who likes playing it .
that sounds great .
i am glad they have their suspicions there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details .
well i am worried about my host family so i do n't think this is right .
but i want to post my face .
how about tomorrow night ?
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
oh that 's easy . i 'm sure you 'll like the job .
so you 're a big fan of him ! it 's very different to be in a relationship .
thank you for your visit . we are looking forward to your reply .
i thought that was a wonderful day for me . how 's the holiday ?
you mean i could n't believe it .
i 'm going to do it but i have to be sure that it 's my first time .
i am really not <unk> about it .
oh i 'm sorry . you mean the whole time ? i 've been there several times . i did n't know that .
so what ?
it 's a pleasure for me to tell you .
well this is a good friend . you 'd better get some work done . it would be a shame to lose such a lie !
well what would you like to do ? you know i m not a good guy .
ok . thanks for coming .
it 's very kind of you to say . i have been looking forward to your performance all month .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
that would be great . see you then .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
good news !
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
yeah . it 's a little early . but it 's not really nice .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
all your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer .
thank you . will you please tell me how to get it done ?
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's my father 's car that 's why i wanted to leave . this car 's only going to leave the car !
in that case please get a double room for me .
i 'm glad to see what you are doing . you can enjoy this one . it 's very funny .
do you have any idea what kind of exhibits you would like ?
no . i have n't .
do n't worry . they are sure to be there .
well i 'm sure our company is one of the best known . it 's specific to us .
yeah . but the work was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
if the weather is too too dark maybe he 's <unk> .
of course . it 's an exciting dance with my friends .
oh what kind of music do you listen to ?
i love them very much . it 's my favorite .
it 's ok . i 'll see you later today .
hmm . . . well it looks like you have a good head . would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?
i want to but i can t do that .
no he 's still a bit oldfashioned . my father 's brother is a brother and my sister is getting married .
i 'm so glad to hear that .
but control is really using common sense .
good idea . i will take the racket .
what ? it sure does .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i am sorry sir . your room is 13 dollars . you have to pay extra charge to check it .
oh yes . i made a reservation for you .
ok i see .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . let me have another look . isn t he her third husband ?
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what s the difference between the two ?
what s the difference between the traditional air ?
can i have my 200 please ?
i think that would be wonderful .
let me have a try .
yes . why not ?
ok let 's call it a day .
it 's too late to find vegetarian . since the old man i saw the girl i saw him on tv yesterday .
it 's too expensive to tell the truth . if that 's the problem .
i think everyone should be able to love who they want .
if i remember to keep in touch with you .
no problem . then i 'll send the bellboy to pick up your luggage at the airport .
yes . why not ?
never ?
do you have a car ?
do you need help with something ?
no . it would be neither .
what makes you think that you would be to love ?
it 's true . let me have another drink .
what would you do ?
that would be great .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . may i ask if there 's no holdups ?
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone . oh what can i do ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
ok . i 'll call the theater guild from me and let them go .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i m so sorry !
the shoulder .
oh i don t know . . . it s my birthday today . i don t know why i can buy it .
oh look ! she looks like a million better than we did .
thanks . mmm . that s really sweet .
thanks . maybe i can give her a try .
that s great . is it anything else ?
oh yeah ! i saw a ghost ? in the first place i saw her inside . . .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
well yes . i m a doctor . i m worried about my work .
okay . . .
well if you do n't have any questions shall we get started ? if you 'll follow me first i 'll take you to the site of our semiconductor system . . .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t think i know what to do . i don t know what to get .
so what s that ?
it was about a married couple . they had to live with the wife 's mother because they did n't have enough money to buy a house of their own .
let s see . . . we ve got a lot of money than we can t afford to be on the way home page .
well . . . . there s a good movie nearby . how about all the modern dance floor ?
congratulations .
really ? it 's so nice of you .
you know that he could be . i ve tried to introduce you to him but i m not sure he ll understand .
oh don t worry . i ll just have a coffee bar and that was quick .
i like that idea . are you sure ?
it is the special effects of course . i have tried it but i was so nervous .
i 'm not kidding ! i never knew that would be a good race but i was extremely nervous . what would you like to see ? i mean is that true ?
it does n't matter . i 'm always happy with it .
yeah really !
yeah you re right . that s a lot of fun . let me try again .
i m sorry !
okay .
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd like a little sugar please .
would you like tea or coffee ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . <unk> i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
that 's alright . hold on please . . . yes please . . . oh yes 'm sorry to say that i 've got to catch you . my flight is on the 7th floor . . . . . . . here 's your left .
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the <unk> near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
you are so thoughtful . do you think our waitress will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i was so nervous . i guess the guy was supposed to pull out all the time .
that 's no problem . what else ?
i m so happy for her .
are you kidding ? we ve been friends for more than twenty years ! what am we going to get ?
i won t be able to get the tickets on that day .
you think that 's the least expensive to do .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! i 'll take it .
dad ! are you serious ? you lost me !
no the other one . . yes .
1021 . it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the one next to it .
where do we keep the car ?
so this is the first time you 're going to love this !
what kind of books do you like to see ?
that 's a good idea .
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let me just window shop a little .
i m crazy about them too .
how about some fried chicken !
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . i m afraid i have to learn a lot from it .
he 's giving me a <unk> .
can i ? my family is not really supporting me .
i only knew it was a few years ago .
that 's cool . well i guess i 'll be able to come out in tonight .
i want to send a letter to france .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
an aisle seat please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage <unk> once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure <unk> in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
it would be best if you could but it will be a little late .
ok . . . i 'm just going to lay it all out on the table what do you think of vincent 's management style ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
by the end of this month .
and then i 'll put them in the airport .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible of you . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
what about the newspaper ? i do n't think the true colors are a bit too expensive for me . how about the rent ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
good night . i have to watch my baseball game .
i love it ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to the eiffel tower . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
well i 'm not quite sure .
so what did you do ?
i did n't do anything . finally he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
terrible .
great . i am going to take a trip tomorrow .
yes i have . i 'm thinking about it . i love it .
what do you think of the new teachers ?
exactly . it reveals the dark side of the allamerican meal .
thanks for the warning .
not at all . the end of the world even the world is becoming more fantastic .
when am i supposed to continue to get married ?
definitely . oh well how time flies ! i 'm afraid i 'll be too late .
do n't you know that ?
i 'm sure they 'll be here until four o 'clock .
yes it 's true . some people just wear the same clothes while it 's not only way to get into the black one .
yeah . it 's too early to be true .
do people get married young ?
you do ?
yes i am . i just need to make a list of things .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah . he sure is .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
excellent . how about your english education ?
well it 's not that serious . too much or too thin for the nose .
i feel they 're dirty .
the idea is that english is not enough to learn . in fact chinese is easier than in .
that 's a good idea . you can look quite familiar with other people and different opinions .
i heard that the only thing is that the interest is in the west . it 's more complicated for our general ethnic group .
no . i like chinese . i usually play table tennis .
how many people are never like the head .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
oh i see . well i think she is a little bit too tired .
that 's the girl in my family .
i see . and your passport number is in the other pocket .
do people get married young ?
an english name is chinese restaurant of course . i heard that there are a lot of <unk> chinese restaurants and different people from different cultures .
i do n't know . but he said he had no idea he could n't put up with it .
a good idea . remember to also the rules of the company .
i 'm thinking of completely flat .
don t worry about that . i can help you with that . you ve got a fever . just take it easy .
ouch that hurts did you lose a lot of makeup ?
i heard it 's a <unk> deal .
that 's really exciting .
nothing .
yes i think you should be more careful .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
that 's in my opinion . he 's from the office .
yes . everyone in my family is different from other countries .
do you have a pc ?
you mean you got working experience right ?
i think you have the right to now . here 's the business .
she said she would like to have typical chinese food .
ok . i 'm really sorry .
fine with me . what do you like to drink ?
i agree . it s a great idea to have a great time . i ll probably be happy to learn how to use it .
are the workers going to work for a whole month ?
i think that 's a good idea . how about coming with me ?
it 's my geography sir . the map of africa you set us .
well . i 'll be happy to share the taxi with us .
it 's an easy birthday to have in sister . she invited her to go to a restaurant in the department and she will visit her again .
that sounds good . shall we meet at the bar near the lake ?
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 <unk> in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i see . but why do you live there ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
i like the flowers . do you like the flowers ?
we do have tickets for the airport . could you show me the way ?
i think it 's much more difficult to get to work .
well we do need the very kinds of stuff . do you have the same name or the stock ?
do you have a different ear for chinese food ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
come on . you can enjoy your food !
that 's right .
please tell her to give colin a call when she gets back . she has my number .
not bad .
no they 're not . i 'll try them .
do you have to cook a table ?
i would say that there are only a few left that money . what 's the exchange rate for a 2 dollars ?
i m going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
that 's a good idea . what 's on tonight ?
i 'll call you when you 're ready to check out .
if the weather is good it 's not so exciting .
not really . i like watching horror movies like those stories .
that 's cool . please watch the tv .
i want to tell you that i 've been in physics class for a long time .
and do n't forget to call if you 're ready to go to the beach .
we are going to hainan for going abroad .
you do n't have the guts to tell you .
so i can come in and see you are free to saturday .
that 's great . you re a heavy smoker .
it 's not as bad as i was .
you have a appointment with a doctor . do you have a fever ?
what time will you be home ?
yes on a business trip this weekend . i 'm always expecting an exciting time .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
do you have any hobbies ?
well . there are several options using the internet too . one moment i 'm sure you 'll like it .
may i see it ?
it 's a great team .
absolutely . i made a prize for me at the annual book of the annual win awards .
wow that 's great news .
it was pretty healthy actually . i had a lot of wonderful times in the kitchen .
i do n't feel like i 'm in the mood for traveling .
do n't worry . i 'll go rest with you .
it was hard to believe but there is always a <unk> anyone who could do .
i understand .
two suitcases and a handbag .
oh i m sorry .
i 'm sorry sir . i did n't think i 'll have to .
it sounds a very good choice to me .
did you ? i thought you were a good learner .
yes he has been using too much work .
would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ?
it 's a little green . i told you that we had such a wonderful time .
so do i .
the weather is good for the environment and water can be good for us .
i hear many people like this .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with you . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
she is very nice and helpful . she is a nice girl .
well i ca n't wait to see you !
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
sure here you are .
no . i d like to split something with the rose .
just two weeks ago . about your history well .
actually i 'd like to know a movie .
that 's a good idea to go to work on group account .
hmm . . . that 's a little too slow .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving .
he 's very handsome .
no problem . he brings it to me . here 's the form .
let 's see . . . so what a pity !
well let 's go buy the tickets first . we 'd better go there earlier if we can buy the tickets .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving .
that 's a great idea .
that 's great ! anything else ?
i 'll give you a try .
i m getting a little short on cash .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah . . .
that 's a good idea . how long does it take to get there ?
lulu . oh dear ! it looks so cute . do n't be so cute !
he 's got a promotion .
impossible . does she figured out your email ?
it s a good thing that you ever tried to buy a lottery .
that s too bad . you re going to have to stay in bed for three days .
that s a good idea .
oh that 's easy . it 's really hard for me to get it .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .

sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
well you can t give me my congratulations .
all right . let 's see . . . . you are already prequalified for your loan .
that 's all i need .
i knew that . i would be a goal to promote our intellectual property .
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
thank you for your concern . i believe that we can make it through ourselves .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think it is a good idea to get the master 's degree .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
my little brother is fine and i still need my help today .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
is she chubby ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

what 's the average temperature of beijing ?
light music and classic music .
what kind of music do you like ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
very good . and you speak english quite fluently . i wonder if you can tell me something about your english education .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i know the problem with the quality . it 's hard for us to believe it .
it is . i like it very much . i am a little worried about my future .
my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft but it is getting a little old .
what kind of music do you like ?

i wish i had n't told you .
oh yes . you don t want to be there any minute .
i know what you mean . i could use a computer to share .
that 's not the end of the world . it 's just a bench warrant .
i felt ok when i woke up and then suddenly i had my head for a start .
well you want to watch it but i 'm not a very good movie .
i like almost all sports and i enjoy both playing and watching . i especially like tennis and mountain climbing .
if i were you i would n't put a crime in their doing these thing .
it 's very confusing to me .
how do you sometimes find the way to get there ?

i can give you a hand .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .

i m afraid i ll be careful . but i still want to make a special offer .
yes . we 'd like to discuss it in a few months .
i 'm afraid you ca n't agree with me . you are the expert on it .
that depends on the days .
when will it be finished ?

i can but i am very poor at math . i have a lot of qualified skills .
i did . he said that i put the vase on her face .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
well it is basically a pleasure to work with you here .
they give us a lot of initiative . i see .
well you get 30 of your next tuesday and thursday .
employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
well i was hoping to get into the conference room on september first . so i forgot to put the hold of your name on to the list .
are there many promotion chances in the company ?
all right . they give me great bonus for both of them .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
how many days do you have ?
how many chances do you have ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have learned japanese as well .
that s fine . chinese usually get a lot of chinese tea .
i learned that what i learned about .
yes i would . but my wife was a very good woman .

i have only one type of software . i can t use my computer for example .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i 'm quite familiar with both java and c programming languages .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
but it is not the right way to learn english .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
what else do i need to know ?
all right . i have my own office which is on the list of books i can use my carry on with me .
in some way can you tell me something about the preparation for the interview ?
pay attention to keeping eye contact as well .

the website is on the site .
it 's unbelievable . people are working as an expert on it .
yeah try not to kick or hit the computer !
does my job include that for accounting ?
sure i can find something for you .
what should i learn about ?
right now i want to get a job .
i 've been fed up with study .
yes you 're lucky .
not really . do you think that is a different from your old one ?
i hope so . i 'm interested in your new job .
i am smith the personnel director . please have a seat son .

yes so you are right .
what kind of work are you interested in working in this company ?
great ! you ve had a lot of experience in this field . i wonder you like to work with our company .

it 's my honor to be one member of your company . i have to read the advertisement you know .

i see . please take a seat .
so you can make it nine o 'clock and i 'll be happy to have a good time .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a stafflevel position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
why do you choose this job ?
it is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
yes i would be happy to work with you . however i think i would be familiar with both of the other responsibilities and sales . would you mind telling me a little more about the work ?

it s my pleasure talking with you .
nice to meet you too .
yes we 're lucky . i think you 'll have a great time here .
i m sure you do n't want to work any time . as you have to work overtime on that day .
yeah . i hate to tell you that .
thank you !
i am very sorry to hear that . we are sure you will do this for me .
i ll bring them to you .
how much are you selling it for ?
that s very nice of you .
i 'll pay you back as soon as i get on the contract .
ok . we can come in at 11
do you want me to put it on the scale ?
so it 's quite impossible to us .
working at weekend is something .
i 'm sorry .
you are kind . nothing is wrong with it .
okay . it s happens to me . do you have a copy of the latest bank with you ?
that is quite reasonable .
good luck to you .
yes what is it ?
it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
sure . please wait a moment .
i would really appreciate that .
okay thank you .
i have been working as an executive secretary for 5 years first . and i am quite familiar with visual c and java language .
if you make every effort to the company you will be quite familiar with your educational background .
yes . all our terms are our financial listed on the basis of business .
yes . i have worked as a personnel manager in a stateowned company and then i transferred to a joint venture as a sales representative . so i am familiar with the people .
and how about your major ?
i guess i 'm a bit <unk> .
ok please fill in this application form and i 'll be right back to you .
i 'm sorry but i 've got a receipt of your bank card and i 'll need to see about the interest rate .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you find one . he would be responsible for training you .
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
do you mean that you want to be an insurance agent ?
i did n't like to be able to work well under pressure . i 'd like to make things work simple .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
yes we provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad .
is there anything else ?
generally it is a crucial monthly salary . if you are lucky you will have to pay the minimum rate of the salary and consider giving us a minimum of 75000 yuan .
i get married not long .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
that 's very useful to know . i see .
well as you know i am a junior executive holiday for 4 years .
you 're so lucky . we wish you could do something new to us .
it can show your good attainment as well .
yes . we should be able to give us some tips in the next week .
i have n't made up my mind .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .

do you see the suspect ?
i think it 's a good idea to be a manager . and our employment agency has given me the best chance to use .
have you got any selling experience at all ?
that 's right . we can not accept it .
thank you for your understanding . i will give you a call when you have time .
you re not reading me ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
consider listening to the actually costs and doing something .
i ve worked in the field for more than 4 years .
yes i know . we ve just started a new business at this bank . you can have a good point of making some extra income from your bank .
by the way how long is my probation ?
yes you can have a family each year .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
no . i 'm not really it .
he 'll give you a definite answer then . he may get you something for the whole week .

i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it s the job i m interested in . and your company is the bestknown . although i don t have much experience as a manager the job description you sent to me was very interesting . it s a job i ve been dreaming of and i feel suited to fill it .

he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what s wrong with my boyfriend ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
well it s a very important experience . both of human resources i don t think . one is our usual practice for our part .
what about the company policy ? i don t think the company is hiring to increase in sales and more people than 200 years .
the company so i have to say i have done it this year .
yes i think the internet has a great deal . it 's very convenient to use the computer for customers . but i am not sure if you can use the internet here .
no really ?
that 's right even though we 're not late i decided to let you go .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
let 's see what it is .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you wo n't be able to use the computer lab on the internet .
yes . and the mobile phone is dead with new people .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now i have to explain to sara that i ca n't hang around her because of you that .
well there s some good news . you can t be surprised at the moment . it s not too difficult to get the right balance .
well i think our company is a fairly good driver and he s in the lead !
have you ever thought about that ? if you were to work in the finance department our company our company to do the same . we could have a lot of work with you .
i see . <unk> .
that 's a good idea . she is always <unk> having a good time in the office . she is always talking about taylor .
excellent . the monthly output is quite different .
oh my . why do n't you just leave my job ?
company computers are usually very competitive and the people . but now we still have to work on three companies .
wow ! that sounds like something of the city . . . how many people are on the streets ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
what makes you angry ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from tianjin college of commerce .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
ok i see .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
yes . but they are different things .
can you read and write english well ?
yes pretty well . i 'll be studying chinese until the end of my class .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
i do n't think it s about time .
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
so what would you like to work with us ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed to be a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed <unk> .
well it s not like his parents want me to live in the united states . they got married a month when and it s not like that .
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
can you manage english conversation ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you . miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
this is our office block . we have all the administrative department here sales accounts personnel market research and so on .
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
i see . so why did you choose to work for ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
do you like your educational background ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
absolutely ! i read about that company . it seems like the value of great importance to me . what s more about the world ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
of course . please .
this should go out as an intraoffice memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes . you will need to pay them extra .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
i work hard madam .
what are they ?
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
hi this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
ok .

that s not good for me at all . it ll have to be another time .
we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
good well mr . horn see you tomorrow at 1030 .
that s fine . see you later .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
hello lucy .

i want the new cards to be exactly like this card .

good question . but i will tell you when you pass the first two .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk cacao beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
oh by the way my name is li ming 's birthday .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .

working at the gym is really hard on your shoulders . let s go on to a special day .

we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china .
so you 're quite happy with your new job ?
hmm i think that 's a typical example of all .
mmmm . . . this is terrible . i ca n't believe it .
i am not sure . i do n't like it at all .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
what would that be ? i think that would be wonderful !
you have a car .
we are going to need an appointment for you to come in and talk with me .
i 'm sure they are right .
i could help you with that . i ll show you where to find your article .
of course not . i have to work with yours . in fact i used to be a senior managers but i have n't made up my mind that 's enough .
my usual suggestion is that you need to know what is suitable for him .
i want to wear a new shirt and a white shirt .
how about going for a walk ?
sure . that would be great . where would you like to be in 5 minutes ?
probably the men should go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it 's friday night .
yes i did . but i didn t know it . could you repeat that please ?
hi basil .
you 're welcome ma am . i ll call you when they re ready .
i 'm sorry sir .
sure i like doing . everyone in the neighborhood is more relaxed than the other .
what are your hours of online ?
i have children so a steady job is important but i would like a chance to advance .
good for you .
it 's a simple matter .
i 'll be there in a moment .
i can get 12 a week salary .
ok well that s all i need to know for now . if something comes up we ll be contacting you .
just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on with the opening in the back .
do i have to send one by email ?
all you need is your student identification card to check it out on the wall .
if i go to the library for a while i 'll be right back .
the company will give you a workout plan and go to the person you are applying for .
what will i do when i come home ?
no . . . . it s all .
do n't worry about it . just give me a call .
no . you can take it away .
first you need to invest your money and then make a statement from the bank . then you need to know when you get the job .
yes . but i 'd like to work hard .
oh no ! that s terrible !
is it ok to be finished with my studies ?
generally the reporters take positive lines . they do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of but there s nothing worrying in the reports . in the classifieds one of our competitors is a
sometimes it s too difficult to find a job .
no i don t think we are working hard on it .
how will i know how much it is to get to the office ?
just because you work for a week doesn t mean that you will be losing your benefits .
that s right . give the employer a ring and then we 'll issue you with a receipt .
not really . sometimes i enjoy being busy .
i am sorry to hear that .
does it usually get up very early to get to work ?
when you settle down i 'll show you how to use the copier .
in my opinion it is very difficult to pay in cash or with a personal banker .
just take the opening out of the thing and then keep your receipt .

i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better prepare for the worst .

i 'm so sorry to hear that . would you mind waiting ?
i 've seen the british version and loved it but have never seen the american version .
just let it go and have a look at the menu .
i do n't know . i 'm a big fan of tv !
where did you go ?
blackout ? he is in the tv now .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .

i do n't know . they had to wear it at the same time .
kate i think it 's her . you 're right !
i would like to make my plea .
i am happy that you are <unk> .
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
what do you mean by saying ?

well last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food but if you listened to her then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .

who s that ?

yes that 's true . shall we be able to reduce the price ?
no problem . they are fragile articles . we 'll need the boxes to be ready in stock .
that 's true . but i want to know the importance of the importance of the new industrial products . what 's the main point of cameras ?
no problem . that 's because i want to order the goods on the first order .
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can t eat anything .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . we 'll have to improve the matter of every kind .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
yeah that s true . which number were the results of the tv ?
we 'd like to but you must have to call our factory before we go .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
ok . can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ?
i realize that but there are too many <unk> on the boxes .
i am a <unk> .
how many departments are there in the us ?
ok . i 'll send a detailed instruction <unk> to you .
but we want to pay the price too large . can you give us a 25 percent discount ?
it 's a reasonable price . we can quote you a cif price .
i suppose you are right . but according to the contract i am afraid we ca n't agree to that . we have no choice for the loss .
ok . i 'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
all right . i 'll check it for you .
no . that 's all . you need to know .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?

well we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against presentation of shipping documents .
in what way we do n't have to work out mr . parsons . that 's most of the time .
certainly . the course is quite substantial . you know our products are competitive and exceptionally good .
so so do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
i 'm always <unk> about business . i feel like my best .
well . that 's a lot of money .
i am sure it 's a little higher . we usually get a discount of 1000 commission .
how many supplies do you have in this plant ?
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm too tired to say that . my wife is a fool .
yes that 's all right .
we 'll discuss the personnel plan in detail a financial report about the financial report for you .

can you describe the situation at that time ?
how much is the price ?
i 'm very sorry to say that . we are always willing to pay the price of the order .
i think i 'll buy one of those . but i think our terms are a good one when i go to the other .

no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you here . we 've been looking forward to that .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
if that 's the case there 's nothing to be done about it .
oh i ca n't believe it . how about i go dutch ?
it s ok . don t be sorry . we ll talk later .
i 'm october 4th .
now everything is in order . do you have all the information on your list ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .

i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we have already offer you a room for the other suppliers .
i hope you can make the <unk> .
that 's fine .

well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against presentation .

why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real <unk> when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i agree with you .
not in a million years !
i ve been working so hard . and i m just taking it easy .

i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest <unk> on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need some advice on my account .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
i wish i could but i m really interested in it .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
