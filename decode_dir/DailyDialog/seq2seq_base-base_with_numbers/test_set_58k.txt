but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? does n't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? i 'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike . . .

you mean the one on the left ?
no officer not at all .
are you sure ?
well i guess i just wasn t paying attention .
i guess you 're right . more often than not people .
um because i was busy talking to my friend .
on a cell phone ?
yes .
that s definitely true . i m going to prescribe some ointment for it . if the rash doesn t clear up in a few days come back and see me . do you have any other symptoms ?
i agree . i ll look in the paper .

nothing really .
are you nuts ? how much is it ?
that 's a good idea .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
no thanks .
why not ?
you 're right . we have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office .
you 've got to be joking . it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
. . .
really ?
i highly recommend you quit soon . the longer you smoke the harder it becomes to quit .
what do you recommend ?
yes .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
that s a good idea . you don t need to worry about missing an issue .
that s a good idea . i ll look into finding something like that .
certainly .
ok thank you .
about 20 to 30 minutes .
do you like it ?
perhaps you 'd be interested in red roses .
yes . thank you .

i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
thank you .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .
why is that ?
i have no idea .
maybe you re right .
not bad . there s a new english teacher .

she is beautiful .
is she old ?
she is quite young .
is she strict ?
not really .
can she speak chinese ?
not very much .
david stop dreaming .

of course you have . you must try harder this time .
and must i go back to school ?
no you need n't do that .
but dad i should be working fulltime at my age . i m nearly 17 .
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn t have failed your exams .
what else i ve got to do ? join the army ?
who knows ! that might come to later .
can i help you ?

sure . why not ?
that 's all right . what can i do ?
yes . i do .
when is the place available ?
very good . how much does it cost ?
yes that 's right .
well it looks like you 've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
great ! i 'll show you some .
oh why do n't you just buy a new one for me ?
what do you mean ?
so what ?
okay .
ok . i 'll take it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .

about six weeks .
ok .
no i 'm not sure .
what 's that ?
what do you mean ?
thank you very much .
yes i 'm afraid i ca n't .
how would you like to pay for it ?
i 'm sure the security is very tight . probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport .
that 's fine .
well that 's fine .
what is it ?
i 've tried that before .
you must be joking .
is that all ?
what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i forgot about it .
anything else ?
i could n't agree more .
yes i d like to activate my voice .
certainly sir . for how many people ?
sure that sounds great ! are there any other fees ?
not at all . no hidden fees .

yes of course .
thanks a lot .
no i haven t . why ?
that s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
that 's a good idea . thanks for your help .
that s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he s better trained to handle these sorts of things .
i think you re right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet . i do n't know how to handle this . this is my first time you know . i m really in love with my friend janet . you appreciate her very much . you think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think i m dumb and uninteresting .
i need to buy a new refrigerator today .
no problem ! we have a broad selection of suits all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
great ! i want a three piece suit preferably made from italian cashmere or wool .
very well sir . would you like to have some shirts made also ?

very good . now if you will accompany me we can take your measurements and choose the patterns .
i need to return a book .
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
i like that kenmore refrigerator .
this particular refrigerator is a very good .
tell me about it .
they might actually win .
what are the appliances .
it 's instructive and inspiring .
i 'd like to see it for myself .
go right ahead .
i like what .
i m afraid we re in for a rough weekend mary . there is a storm system moving through the east coast .
that s pretty chilly for the summer ! will it rain on saturday ? i heard it s going to be a lot of fun . i hope it won t be too hot i can t stand the heat
unfortunately yes . it will be clear early saturday morning .
that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday .
it gets better on sunday though .
don t worry about it . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course for these sites you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . if he wants to do something like go to bed or be washed etc . please guide or help him to get it done but lead him with gentleness .

wow . . .
i 've been away in paris for the last two month . glad to see you .
oh really ? what did you do ?

where did you begin your journey ?
you know .
why is that ?
thank you very much .
of course i will .
no .
i will see you tomorrow then .
thank you .
no thanks .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
haha . that 's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent .
you 're welcome . bye !
you 're welcome .
i know what you mean .
why is that ?
thanks for letting me know .
calm down ! what happened ?
yes he does .
give me a call and we 'll contact him .

no wonder he is so cute .
me too .
thank you . i will try my best .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader .
really ? what happened ?
do n't you think it 's a little early to be looking for schools ?
thanks a lot .
i 'm afraid . i do n't know .
yes i did .
what did you think ?
beautifully done many times .
but i think it was n't too bad .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you .
i ca n't think the same .
it must be locked .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
it 's nothing .
do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
i 've got a backache .
what 's the problem ?
no it 's not .
no problem .
thank you very much .
do you know what time it is ?
very well .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
he is fine .
what happened ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
and why are you <unk> now ? are you bored ?
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
because i want to be a lawyer .
you know what ?
what about the price ?
what 's the problem ?
but i do n't like the story .
you are right . the special effects were amazing . and i like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings .
i 'm sick of it .
the door bell does n't work .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we would n't put up with it !
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid fingerpointing when you haven t got .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
what s the matter ?
it s all right .
are you married ?
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you .
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick .
poor girl !
nothing special .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
for example ?
no .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
she broke up with her boyfriend .
that sounds pretty good . tell me about it .
are you crazy ?
no i m sorry . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
i do n't know .
are you serious ? i don t know .
how about you ?
that s a problem .
good idea .
yes i will .
i see .
thank you very much .
what ?
what happened ?
good idea .
thank you very much .
he must be joking .
thank you for your compliments . i will try even harder to repay the company .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking .
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee .
it s interesting .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a private garden .
thank you very much .
i 'm looking for .
sure . here you are .
i do n't know .
why do you say that ?
in boston .
how much ?
no problem .
how much is it ?
why not ?
what ?
what do you think about the teachers ?
i 'd love to .
go ahead .
are you serious ?
yes .
ok .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company ?
what do you mean ?
what are you going to do with it ?
i do n't know .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some <unk> program ?
what is it ?
it 's a surprise .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought .
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good .
no problem .
thanks .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me .
did n't i ?
you know you .
i 'm sorry .
take care of yourself .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
what do you mean ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men !
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up !
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh .
what do you mean ?
yes i do .
it 's ok .
i hope so .
her father .
yes i do .
what 's the problem ?
what is it ?
why do n't you just take it ?
what do you mean ?
where are you going ?
why ?
i 'm glad you like it .
i do n't think so .
really ? have you ever been there ?
that 's true .
oh yes it does .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
tell me about it .
that 's true .
what 's the matter ?
it 's no problem .
i hope so .
no i ca n't . i 'm lefthanded .
how about this one ? it 's graceful in style .
that 's fine .
no problem . how would you like to pay for it ?
thank you .
it 's my pleasure .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
do n't mention it .
hey what if the three of us go to the beach ?
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well things are all right .
terrible . it must be something serious .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal .
really ? what happened ?
i told you .
that 's pretty harsh .
i 'm sorry .
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice .
the port is quite exquisite .
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try .
oh what 's that ?
i feel terrible .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks .
cheers .
yes i am .
i am going to the hotel to pick you up .
no problem .
yes .
no problem .
that 's cool .
he 's playing .
what did you do ?
where s yours ?
he must be regretting about having done the business .
he 's very tall and handsome .
what did you do ?
he would n't say that again .
what happened ?
why ?
what are your plans ?
yes but i bet 200 dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going .
what were the odds ?
20 to 1 .
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be .
i do n't know .
what did you do ?
i watered all the plants .
did he leave when you left ?
yes .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it .
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
thanks .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally .
what gift ?
black rose .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept it .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about .
yes .
what 's the matter ?
why ?
i did n't think of that .
i do n't think so .
what about the kitchen ?
let 's go then .
good luck .
yes they did .
i see . thank you very much .
you have to give up smoking .
it ca n't be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you .
i spilled my drink .
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .
yes please .
that s true . but even beyond that there s the question of meeting the deadlines they ve set .
why not ?
i see .
do n't you think it 's a bit bright ?
that 's true . by the way what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
really ?
what happened ?
that 's right . do you want to go with me ?
thank you .
i love you too .
i 'm not sure yet .
yes ! i 'm glad to hear that .
sure .
i know where that is .
thanks for letting me know .

did you go to the magic kingdom ?
yeah you are right .
yes .
that 's right .
where are you going ?
basketball and swimming .
do you have a credit card ?
no i 'm not .
that 's true . by the way what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
are you sure ?
it 's handsome .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
it 's still early .
thanks a lot .
hello john .

me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet .
what 's wrong ?
bob .
really ?
yes .
no wonder you 're such a wacko . . .
today is december 232002 .
what 's he doing ?
i do n't know .
what did he do ?
i 'm going to work .
i like playing basketball .
thank you .
yes .
what 's it like ?
how do you think so ?
of course not . people all over the world watch it on tv .
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i went to the new year s concert in <unk> .
so what do you think about it ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
why ? what 's the problem ?
oh yes .
what did he say ?
i wish you the best of luck .
really ?
yes i am .
yes he is .
what happened ?
i did n't know that .
certainly .
it 's gorgeous .
yes .
really ?
ninethirty .
what about the memory ?
i think so .
but why do n't you like it ?
have you made a reservation ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yes . here you are .
after a while .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure .
anything else ?
what do you mean ?
yes please .
do you have a problem ?
it 's 486 yuan .
what 's that ?
i have no idea .
where are you going ?
no i do n't .
that 's right .
what do you think i should do ?
what do you mean ?
really ? i ca n't believe it .
sure . what is it ?
thanks a lot .
sure .
thank you very much .
i have no idea .
is that so ?
very well . what about you ?
it does n't look like that .
no i 'm not .
where are you going ?
i guess you 're right . i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
thank you very much .
sure . what do you need ?
bye .
i hope so too .
no i do n't think she 's that strongminded .
what time does it start ?
yes i 'd like to .
of course i know . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
is it just now ?
yeah about two weeks ago .
and what did you do after that ?
what is it ?
exactly . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
yes that 's right .
that makes sense .
i 'm not familiar with it .
he 's going to be broke up with his girlfriend .
i see . does he live by himself ?
yes he does .
where do you live ?
it s my pleasure .
do you really think so ?
bye !
i 've got a backache .
what do you mean ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages .
for instance the mobile phone seriously <unk> the attention of people from work .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone .
do you have any hobbies ?
i do n't think so . what do you think ?
they are really running you into the ground . why don t you ask for some time off ? you could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
i ca n't afford to miss you .
why ?
thank you very much .
no problem .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories .
are you sure ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include <unk> that enter .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
why ?
what can i do ?
i m glad to hear that .
i was just robbed !
what are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ?
he never came .
what happened ?
this job is sixtyfive thousand dollars per year .
what made you decide to change your job ?
why ?
i see . so it 's not for your company it 's for the <unk> partner ?
what 's it about ?
what 's your mailing address ?
what is that ?
what do you mean ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
me too .
tomorrow afternoon would be fine .
where did you go to university ?
thank you .
me too .
ok .
i do n't know . . .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
that 's a good idea .
really ? what 's that ?
what ?
what do you mean ?
good afternoon !
terrible .
glad to meet you .
glad to meet you too .
yes .
do you have anything to declare ?
thank you very much . bye .

why is that ?
i guess i expected too much from the movie .
i guess it could happen .
how old is she ?
that 's great . give me a minute .
me too .
that 's true . thank you for your advice .
done .
what time ?
all right .
why not ?
what 's the problem ?
that sounds good .
that 's fine .
thank you very much .
hello ?
yes it is .
where ?
yes sir . for how many people please ?
do you have a seat ?
that would be fine .
no thanks . i 'm fine .
okay .
my name is du tao number 3 .
sure . no problem .
the view is breathtaking .
yeah i know what you mean . that 's why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends i have n't seen in a long time .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if she saw myra cheating she certainly had the right to say so .
but why do n't you just quit ?
where is it ?
why do you like it ?
who is ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ?
great . i 'll call you saturday morning .
what 's wrong with it ?
i 've got it .
yes . very wonderful .
where are you from ?
where is it ?
calm down !
what ?
he does n't make any sense .
not yet .
what did you do last night ?
no i would n't .
what did he do ?
thank you very much . i think i lost it .
how long did you stay there ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun .
that happened to my oldest girl . she became really upset when her classmates told her santa was n't real .
i hope so .
the game .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better .
but the brazilian is tougher .
how old is he ?
he 's over sixty .
have you ever had any trauma ?
i see .
that does n't sound too bad .
why not ?
that 's a good idea . it 's the best season for tourists in florida . you can also get a good suntan there .
i see .
hey ! i ca n't believe it . a slam dunk !
why not ?
yeah i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples not to mention two people from different cultures .
why ?
how much ?
you are deadly right .
i like playing chess .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i do .
well let 's go and have a look .
why not ?
not much .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well he 's tall and strong .
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i think i like classical music better .
how about samba ?
how about this one ? it 's our biggest 16 in diameter .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes that 's the best i can do .
i like listening to the classical music .
that s a good idea . i think the best way to prevent aids is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner .
not bad .
oh really . that is great news .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute .
he is a nice guy and very considerate .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
what did he say ?
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
oh thank you mary . you 're so nice .
sounds good .
that 's it .
but it 's unfair for her . how old is she anyway ?
really ?
i hope so .
yeah i think so .
yes .
and they are so cute !
what do you mean ?
in college .
that sounds like fun .
because i do n't know what to do .
i 'm going to the hospital .
i agree .
all right . let 's go .
thanks .
what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?
give me a break . you do n't care about the colors .
what happened ?
yes i am .
are you doing anything ?
it looks nice . how much is it ?
really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
i do n't know .
sounds like a good idea .
no problem .
all right .
ok let 's go .
i have no idea .
wow ! that 's great . congratulations .
yes .
come on .
what did you do ?
do you have any questions ?
why ?
i hope so .
i think so .
no what ?
what 's wrong ?
did you see his face ?
what ?
really ? what happened ?
no not yet .
thank you very much .
what happened ?
ok . i 'll tell him .
he seems to be very happy with rose .
how old is she ?
i have no idea .
i got it . don t worry .
did you see his face ?
really ? what happened ?
what 's the matter ?
what did he do ?
he never came .
what happened ?
that 's not bad .
to be honest he has no authority . he 's a hardworker but no one listens to him .
do you really think so ?
thanks . i really appreciate it .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
great . thanks .
yes i am .
what did you do last night ?
that 's true .
that 's for sure .
no we do n't .
that 's fine .
no i have no idea .
what did you do ?
nothing special .
what happened ?
nothing .
so what did you do ?
what 's the matter ?
oh i see . i thought maybe it was just the time of the day although it is n't usually busy at 230 .
i watered all the plants .
really ?
my parents .
did you lose any weight ?
no problem .
what did you say ?
what 's the matter ?
i did n't know you liked birdwatching .
yes i ca n't .
i do n't know .
i agree with you completely .
me too .
it 's half past seven .
what 's wrong with it ?
no i have n't . i 've always wanted to do that .
thanks a lot .
how far is it ?
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
nice to meet you too .
why not ?
yes . and what about you ?
see you .
what 's the matter ?
i see . and anything else ?
here you are .
exactly .
yeah .
why did you lie to me ?
that 's all .
huh ?
yes .
i do n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
you re in america now my british friend .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on .
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so .
is he ok ?
yes he is .
why do you say that ?
the giants ?
yeah .
what happened ?
that 's all right .
the <unk> s <unk> just threw a touchdown pass .
yeah i just got them .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
what 's it ?
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb .
what did you do last week ?
i watched tv .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
o . k . see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
why not ?
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
we went to malaysia and thailand .
that must have been wonderful .
well we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
they might actually win .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
why ?
he is everybody 's type .
no i 'm not .
yes i know what you mean .
i don t know .
haha . that 's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent . and the ball is often kept flying overhead drawing beautiful curves in the sky . such games are quite pleasing to the eye .
i do n't know . . .
absolutely . that 's why when he entered the final i was so excited .
i think that 's the problem .
what 's that ?
i think that 's a bad idea . i 'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
yes of course .
that 's true .
they do .
you mean a lot ?
she 's really beautiful .
i do n't know .
is that all ?
do n't worry . there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger .
i think so .
that 's true . but if i were you i would n't have the courage to watch the first one .
surely of course .
you re probably right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn t always this grouchy you know . . .
what are you watching ?
yes . it says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter .
alright . let me have a look . . .
yes .
is that all ?
yes that 's what i think .
wow ! i 'm impressed . so what 's in the cards for future training ? will it be inhouse or offsite ?
for example .
really ? let me see if i can clarify that . the terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months .
that is true .
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
that 's no problem . we can have a company car take you there .
yes .
what a pity . are you likely to be getting more in ?
no problem .
how much does it cost ?
what happened ?
what about the memory ?
yes it is .
what 's it like ?
i don t think so .
how about this one ?
quite good .
single or return ?
thank you .
is it all right ?
yes they are .
so what kind of demands do they have ? what are they asking for specifically ?
not really . they all seem to focus on the election .
what does that mean ?
do n't mention it .
no nothing .
is it urgent ?
sure why not ?
would 700 be ok ?
really ?
cool !
terrible .
well i had no idea .
i do n't know . . .
yes he was .
i did n't know .
what is it ?
i know what you mean .
sounds like a good idea !
what 's that ?
yes it is .
wow . it sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
i hope you 'll have a good time .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
in five years .
i see . anything else ?
oh yes .
is that so ?
that 's a good idea .
500 dollars .
really ?
ok . thank you .
that 's all right .
yes i am .
why ?
what 's your mailing address ?
what happened ?
yes .
maybe you are right .
what 's the difference between these two styles ?
do n't worry . everything will be fine .
no wonder you 're such a wacko . . .
i know what you mean . i ca n't stand computer geeks .
what 's it about ?
let me see . it 's not an eagle . i think it 's a vulture .
sure . i 'd love to .
yes . it says it will be sunny .
yes . i hope so .
anything else ?
done .
all set . may can you help me take all these things to the living room ?
okay it sounds good .
hooray ! i can play football with daddy .
yes .
why are they all in glass boxes ?
because they are <unk> .
so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
i see . thanks a lot .
yeah they all come from a very ancient time .
really ?
the bronze cup was made 4000 years ago . it 's priceless !
i m sure he will .
thank you for telling me . i will try it .
nothing . how about you ?
ok i guess . what about you ?
really ? what 's he been doing ?
you know what ?
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things .
ok .
i do n't know what to do .
why not ?
thank you very much .
you are welcome .
oh i see . thank you very much .
that sounds very interesting .
in my opinion overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports .
how about this one ?
that sounds like a good idea .
what 's the problem ?
ok . i 'll come back later .
i hope so .
i see .
oh that 's too bad .
no problem .
thanks .
thank you .
yes !
you 're welcome .
thanks .
what about you ?
why ?
yes it is .
that 's good .
no problem .
thank you very much .
why is that ?
how much is the service charge ?
yes i think so .
like what ?
yes .
how long will it take to get them dry ?
yes .
i see .
i do n't know .
yes of course . is there anything wrong ?
before .
oh i see .
well i have no idea .
that 's true .
certainly .
i bet it 's expensive .
yes .
please .
yes of course .
for example ?
let 's see . . .
i see . ok . . .
yes .
all right .
yes .
what 's the matter with you ?
that 's true . by the way what are these in the plates ?
is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ?
for example ?
i ca n't figure it out .
in that case there is nothing more to be said . what 's your last word as to the date then ? do you think i should use powerpoint ?
i did n't sleep much last night .
how come ?
i have no idea what to do .
that 's true .
yes .

once a week .
yes i know .

that 's a good idea . let 's discuss after work .
what happened ?
yes it was really a good game .
certainly .
how about tomorrow night ?
why is that ?
yes .
are you sure ?
do you really want to ?
thank you .
no thanks .

he 's probably a pervert . just ignore him .
i d love to .

i do n't know .
maybe you are right .
thank you very much .

he is too <unk> .

what are your salary expectations ?
i see .
i see . thank you .
i can do that .
that 's good .
i see .
where did you go ?
yes i know . thank you very much .
yes .
that 's right .
yes . why ?
nothing .
why ? what 's wrong ?
who has a crush ? !
go ahead please .
well i do n't have the guts to ask her out .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself .
you 're kidding .
oh it 's so nice .
you 're welcome .
yeah i guess so .
absolutely ! i have n't seen her for a while .
sure here you are .
you 're lucky .

i bought it in a store .

do you have the receipt ?
what do you think of it ?
how old is she ?
that 's really true .
do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
really ?
oh it 's kind of you to say .
me too . i do n't know why but every time i see the guy i break into a cold sweat .
thanks for reminding me . i 'll continue to exercise as soon as i finish this project .
you 're welcome .
thanks .
i 'm sorry .
nothing .
that 's great .
yes i am .
where ?
why ?
i honestly have no idea .
all right . let 's go .
how about 600 ?
ok .
yes i think so .
it 's my pleasure .
thank you .
it 's very nice of you to say so .
thanks . goodbye .
thank you .
i 'm not sure .
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm not sure .
that sounds great .
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant .
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
well do you want to go with me ?
over here please .
that 's great .
that 's all right .
tomorrow night .
thanks !
happy new year !
i 've been working so hard lately .
that sounds great .
merry christmas !
merry christmas !

really ? you must be joking .
i do n't know .
how old is he ?
he 's over sixty .
i m glad to hear that .
yes it is .
do you have any other questions ?
what 's her figure ?
she 's a teacher .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
pardon ?
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect politics to be true anyway .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
her father .
not really . how about you ?
ok . here you are .
what do you mean ?
thank you very much .
how much does it cost ?
no problem . that can be done . i understand you 'll ship the goods before the end of may ?

thanks .
i hope that it does .

i see . thank you .
i went to tamshui . you ?
did you go to the zoo ?
yeah you are right .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them .
do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other .
that s right .
do you have anything to declare ?
yes they are right .
you are so pessimistic ! the olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed .
of course . i will .
anything else ?
thanks for letting me know .
how about going to the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
is that the red one ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot .
any other ideas ?
not really .
it sounds great .
very well . thank you .
don t worry about it .
yes it is .
why ?
that 's fine .
yes you are right .
thirteen of them .
well i like them very much .
all right .
yes .
of course i do n't want to . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past only a tiny number of people played .
that 's really true .
no .
really ? how often do you go there ?
yes .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i think so .
yes actually .
how did you like it ?
fine .
when i was a child .
what s the matter ?
no problem .
i think i caught a cold .
that 's great .
it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen .
when did you happen ?
what 's the matter ?
why not ?
thank you .
how old is she ?
oh really ?
when did you begin to learn english ?
yes he told me about it .
i don t know .

what s the matter ?

thank you for telling me about it .
joe ? what do you mean ?

no i have n't but i 've seen it .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i need to improve my english .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise . i d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . i m not sure i d be good enough to play in a band . i d love to but i m afraid i have to work late tonight . we ve got to get the contract ready for miss king .
why don t you try then ?
hi .
yeah i saw someone walking like you .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender .
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
okay . . .
hey !
i know what you mean . i understand .
no uh . . .
well i 'll be glad to help you out .
good luck !
really ? that 's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ?
that 's too bad .
yes that 's right . but i have to study .
ok . go on .
what is it ?
yes .
what kind of car would you like ?
is that right ?
what kind of person do you prefer to work with ?
yes i 'm fine . and you ?
me too . but what do you do there ?
what do you mean ?
why do n't you have a garage ?
that 's true . she 's highly esteemed among everyone at my company .
oh really ? what happened ?
haha that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
no .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
well i have the day off from work .
yes .
why ? what time is it ?
i know what you mean . i find it difficult to make new friends too .
yes but it was n't very interesting .
wow ! i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
well i like to play the piano for fun .
that 's true .
yes .
that 's fine . i 'll bring the wine .
sure .
i got it .
just today .
what is it ?
of course not .
what do you want to do ?
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i 'm not sure .
are you sure this time ?
thank you .
10 .
that 's all right .
how much is it ?
fine . i ll do my best .
who s this ?
thank you .
okay .
i see .
thank you .
really ? that 's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ?
no i do n't think so .
what 's your mailing address ?
that 's right . thanks for your advice .
i know .
no . not really .
it is located .
i see . thanks for your help .
of course . you must be joking . you ca n't fall in love with someone you 've never met !
what 's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
no problem .
oh i see . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .
i 'm fine bob . i 've been out of town . i just got back .
it 's okay .
me too . did you hear about frank ?
i spilled my drink .
for example ?
that 's all right .
that 's a good idea . you know i got a <unk> buddy that runs a consultant firm . he 's an expert in organizational comunication . he does't come cheap but he 's an expert in this field .
yes i think so .
it 's everything .
i don t know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability .
it s john .
mike ?
nice to meet you too .
really ? i m not so sure .
i see .
i see . thanks a lot .
what s the matter ?
oh no . i forgot about it .
yes .
why is that ?
toyota <unk> 2002 .
i see .
are you sure about that ?
ok . let s go .
yes it is .
i see . there s a garden in the back .
yes . thank you very much .
no .
really ? what happened ?
thanks .
do you really think so ?
yeah you have some other ideas ?
what do you mean ?
for example ?
no .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a <unk> .
i think so .
yeah . they suit each other .
i do n't like it .
that 's not fair . we had fun . give me a second chance . can we meet tomorrow night for drinks ?
okay . let 's go .
thank you for your caring . i will .
why not ? i think it 's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
really ?
yes i do .
how much longer will mr . schmidt be up in the mountains ?
i do n't know .
let me see . en . . it 's right now .
no problem .
no i ca n't . i 'm sorry .
that 's too bad . i wish your mother can recover soon .
yeah i know what you mean . but it 's just a movie . they need for the characters to do that .
for example ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable .
someone has stolen my gold necklace .
take it easy . it is all over now . how was it going anyway ?
really ?
i 'm going to withdraw .
how can you get that done ?
i got it .
what else ?
your passport .
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
that depends .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
why not ?
yes . i like gardening .
why ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
what ?
not bad . how about you ?
thank you .
i could n't agree with you more .
here you go .
yes but i do n't know what to do .
poker .
why not ?
just fine .
all right . let 's go .
thanks for your help .
all right .
are you serious ?
it 's hard to say . but i do love waltz .
exactly .
what ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
that 's it ?
very well . what about you ?
i feel the same way .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend .
sure . i 'd love to .
yeah . it was a good game . it won t always be this good but we can t make it last longer than it should .
yes they are .
that sounds like a good idea . let 's go and have a drink .
oh it 's interesting . i see .
cool ! anything else ?
yes .
nothing . what about you ?
yes i know . but i do n't like it .
what 's that ?
that 's not my fault .
yeah ?
i sure did .
really ? i did n't know that .
i have no idea . what about you ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i will try my best to assist you if you need any help .
what kind of music do you like best ?
ok i see . here you go .
yes . it 's a tradition .
absolutely .
they are attending an international conference here .
sure . but you know that i ca n't .
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
ok . let 's go .
what about this one ?
do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
here you are .
i don t know what other people think .
what do you mean ?
what should i bring with me ?
no i do n't think so .
how long will it take to get there ?
oh yes . i remember now .
anything else ?
how much is it ?
thank you very much .
what 's that ?
ok . anything else ?
what 's it about ?
candlelight in the window
what time does it start ?
where are you going ?
no . . .
what 's the matter ?
just a minute please .
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
i think so .
you got promoted ?
what 's the temperature ?
now you are right .
yes i know it .
now that s a good idea !
no what is it ?
yes it is .
the view is breathtaking .
great !
is that right ?
too .
what is it ?
<unk> .
maybe that 's true .
i have to work .
but do n't you think it 's a bit conservative ?
yes it is .
where ?
what about next monday ?
do you know where the bookstore is ?
yeah i love it .
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's terrible .
i like pop music . do you ?
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
really ? me too .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
what 's wrong with it ?
yeah .
bill and betty .
do n't worry .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god !
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
thanks for letting me know .
of course i will .
i see .
it sure is .
maybe he 's abnormal .
maybe you are right .
that 's true .
what 's your favorite animal ?
thank you for telling me that .
i hope so .
that 's good .
that 's true .
sure why not ?
sure that sounds like a good idea .
<unk> .
okay .
it is a good game .
i agree with you . she s already got married .
i am so happy that she 's doing okay .
i do n't know . . . she 's pretty but she always blows hot and cold .
it 's peter .
i see .
that must be interesting .
certainly .
i agree .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of spamunwanted email form .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list .
how do i do that ?
what do you mean ?
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention .
i love being <unk> ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious .
noone really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that .
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said .
thanks but actually i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection .
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word .
i see . have you found anything yet ?
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do .
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ?
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several <unk> .
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day .
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops .
i d say the main reason is poverty .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
what 's your mailing address ?
i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
of course .
yes .
i think so .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company ?
according to the article you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is <unk> on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts .
i know . and some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
no .
why do you say so ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite .
but it s so old .
do you like it ?
no not at all .
are you married ?
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main <unk> ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
he is too scared .
won t they get his inheritance ?
no that s the problem .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this one ?
ok . that sounds like a deal .
not at all .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sounds like a good idea .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
yes . i like traveling .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i love it .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
yes it is .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking .
how in the world did you get a copy ?
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out .
not a great deal .
what 's the matter ?
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things .
yes ?
is this your car ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
yeah i know what you mean . that 's why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends .
what 's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
what 's your mailing address ?
you 're probably right . i 'll go and get them for you .
well mary types faster than jones .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
unfortunately not .
how about languages ?
good idea .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
he is beautiful .
yes .
where ?
um that s good .
very well .
i 'd like to .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything .
oh that 's too bad .
why ?
i know what you mean .
i hope so .
yes of course .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure .
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
yes .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
yes .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i have to work .
i m looking at my horoscope !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are horoscopes ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign .
january 5th .
let me see .
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is seriousminded and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
no good idea !
ok !
what is ?
our cousin pete ! my turn !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm going to wangfujing .
mumm . no .
yes ?
what ?
what happened ?
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other .
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred ?
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino <unk> and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here sa beach ball and a frisbee a pail .
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your <unk> .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ?
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i think so .
bye !
why don t you go ahead of me ? i have more items than you .
let me just grab my wallet . you certainly do look happy this morning .
<unk> .
what are you talking about ? it wasn t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
yes ?
i understand .
what 's it ?
anything else ?
what happened ?
ok . i hope you can make it .
yeah why not ?
all right . i ll let you know when i ve sorted out my clothes .
what happened ?
you re right . i m being crazy ! ok i m ready let s do this !
ok let s go check out the kitchen next .
why ?
oh no . i never thought about it that way .
i see what you mean . he s really cute .
what s the matter ?
i m not sure . let me see . are these all in good condition ?
oh that s the one . . .
what was the weather like ?
cool ! they are beautiful .
i do n't think so .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
well i m looking forward to seeing you .
what happened ?
i spilled my drink .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ? we ve got strappy sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes <unk> . she s a real wiz on powerpoint . let s go and have a look . you know which team he supports don t you ? can t you stay a little longer and have some tea as well ?
oh just for a position as a gas station .
uhhuh .
then ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it !
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
ah ! what can i do for you ?
what s wrong ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
thanks a lot .
are you joking ? what happened ?
you re right . i m being crazy ! if i m going to live on my own i have to be independent so i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
exactly !
what does that mean ?
oh no i 'm fine . thank you .
here you are .
i 'm throwing a party .
i 'd rather have meat .
anything else ?
her father .
what do you want ?
how much do you have ?
good idea .
it is nice .
it 's been a long time .
thank you very much .
me too .
thank you !
to tell you the truth it 's been quite stressful .
i usually go to the cafeteria .
i see .
good luck !
sure i will .
why not ?
what food are we out of ?
yes i will .
ok . bye .
i do n't care .
good .
that 's right .
where do you live ?
i hope so .
yes i find jogging does good to me .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
why is that ?
thank you very much .
what do you mean ?
oh good idea ! i love it .
are you sure ?
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
haha . that 's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent . and the ball is often kept flying overhead drawing beautiful curves in the sky . such games are quite pleasing to the eye .
oh yeah i forgot it .
that s a good idea . we can chill out a little in such a hot summer .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the matter ?
that 's true . thank you very much .
which kinds of food do you like best ?
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's a good idea .
kobe .

it was no big deal .
yes i do .
what kind of sport do you like best ?
one afternoon .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
how was that ?
what do you mean ?
palmistry ? what is that ?
what 's it about ?
oh you mean palm reading .
are you sure ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large <unk> line .
i know . . .
no not really .
because i want to tell you about .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person .
so what did you do ?
i watered all the plants .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work .
what 'd he do ?
he did n't say .
i see .
it means that i 'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ?
why are you so bitter ? no one tells worse joke than you .
maybe you re right . i m being crazy ! ok i m ready let s do this !
it depends .
yes you are right .
but it is really cool .
can you tell me why ?
me too .
how much does it cost ?
yes . i think so .
what do you mean ?
it 's a good idea . but let me see . . .
oh my god !
i do n't know . i have n't tried yoyo since that party !
are you sure ? i 've been here for too long . next year will be my fiveyear anniversary . i want a change . . .
40 .
mmmm . . . how about the period of repayment ?
let 's call it a deal . hope to see you again soon .
i 'm sorry for hero .
i know . this is terrible . what can we do ?
how do you pay for it ?
this way please .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not .
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why ?
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner .
of course ! it is the no .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude .
but i don t think we can change our working condition .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them .
i 'm afraid not .
that 's true . four years trails and hardships joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . i can hardly tell whether i am joyful or gloomy at the moment when i am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . what about you ? do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
yes they did .
so what did you do ?
thanks a lot .
not bad .
oh really . that is great news .
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute .
he is a nice guy and very considerate .
yes he is .
i signed up for it .
what 's the problem ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's all right . shall we meet at the bar near the beach ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
do you want to take the jet ski ?
it 's a piece of cake .
this dress is really good .
you re right .
sixty cents a piece .
it 's ok .
good luck .
do n't be silly .
i 'm serious .
what 's the matter ?
what about here ?
they 're fine . i 'll take it .
yes you are right .
how much is it ?
no i don t .
how much is it ?
well what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? you could ve gotten something .
hmm . . . i know . but i 'd better not give up . i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do n't you ?
is that so ?
last night .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .

when does it start ?
ok .
good .
sure .
thanks a lot .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms .
fantastic ! i enjoy <unk> especially those clubs with live bands .
how did that happen ?
i did n't know .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
that 's all right .
thanks for letting me know .
yeah .
what happened ?
china .
what ?
it says wet paint !
wonderful !
anne !

not bad .
guangzhou . i 've got a cousin there .

where do we pay the fare ?
follow me please .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
you have to get off at the square .
thanks .
no you do n't have to .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?

oh ! what 's wrong with it ?
what did you do ?
it did .
hmm . . .
i was seventeen .
did you hit the unit ?
thanks i will .
that s true . but even beyond that there s the question of meeting the deadlines they ve set .
no i do n't .
yeah the government really takes a bite .
exactly .
yeah i don t mind it either . we ll both end up rich slobs and not need it but what if we do ?
yeah .
yeah . my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
yes i think so .
no i haven t .

laura .

what s the problem ?
i went to paris .
how long do you want to stay ?
i 'll turn it on .
i don t know what to do .

by train .
my house was robbed last night .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have have . but i have to wait .
what do you mean ?
her father .
what happened ?
thanks for your help .
what 's your mailing address ?
what do you mean ?
yes the weather sure is nice today .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
the weatherman says it 's going to snow .
that does n't sound pretty .
ok .
i do n't think so .
that sounds like fun .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
for what time ?
are you kidding me ?
that sounds like fun .
it s a fun job .
what happened ?
why ? what s up ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to wangfujing .
how old is he today ?
it 's his 50th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday .
sure thing . what are your plans ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible .
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music .
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it .
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about 10 years old .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like variety shows .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex .
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs .
in my country there s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it s about six minutes per hour .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times .
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes !
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen .
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . . .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i sure did .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure .
yes . i have .
i went a global warming .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves .
like what ?
basketball and swimming .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue .
yes i have .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious .
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from canada .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
no but my father 's car .
that sure did n't last long !
great . thanks .
what happened to him ?
he did .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not .
what happened to him then ?
nothing .
did they take his license away ?
no they did n't .
what do you think will happen to him ?
why ?
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea .
it would probably be very expensive .
i can t afford that .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money <unk> .
we had a fantastic time .
no i did n't .
why ?
you 're right . but what do you think about it ?
because you do n't have to wear them .
why ?
yes .
that 's right .
i 've been here for too long .
why ?
i see .
that 's why i applied for this job .
i do n't think so .
yes i will .
not bad . what about you ?
what 's wrong with it ?
you 're right .
that 's too bad .
yes .
what happened ?
it only cost me a few dollars .
that 's too high .
how about this one ?
what do you mean ?
yes .
why not ?
i 'm not sure yet .
where did you find it ?
no . have you ?
me too .
yes of course .
nothing .
that 's exactly what i want thank you .
it 's true .
i do n't know .
all right .
is that right ? we 're very sorry .
the one .
so what do you think of it ?
he 's on the other side .
your name please ?
glad to meet you .
what do you mean ?
yes he is .
why ?
but i like the feeling .
i know what you mean . i 'm like a yoyo .
good luck .
so do i .
what do you think i should do ?
thank you .
yes . i remember .
oh i guess i will .
ok . i 'll go right now .
so what 's the problem ?
thank you very much .
goodbye .
well that depends .
ok .
no thanks ! i ca n't afford to pay for it .
so what do you want to do ?
do you want to have a look ?
can i have a look at them ?
well let 's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn .
yes .
that s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he s better trained to handle these sorts of things .
let me see . it 's not an eagle . i think it 's a vulture .
cindy you know .
they are 168 .
i do n't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting .
i ca n't afford that .
why do you think so ?
what do you mean ?
why not ? he is a <unk> .
10 .
because . . .
yes . i think so .
thank you for your caring . i will .
what are you thinking of getting ?
i hope so .
that 's fine with me . what do you want to have ?
why not ?
sounds good .
really ? what happened ?
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i 'm sorry .
bye !
not bad . what about you ?
what do you think is the most important thing for you ?
nothing special . what about you ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
i hope so .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
how did he know that ?
i hope so .
pretty good .
i 'm glad to hear that .
there are four people in my family .
how about your family ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
yes .
i see .
why not ? they are entertaining .
how about your family ?
no i do n't think so .
i 'm glad to hear that . please give my regards to him .
thanks you too .
what 's the matter ?
thanks for letting me know .
really ? are you sure this is a good idea ?
huh ?
yes . and you ?
how do you know that ?
ok . i 'll talk to you later .
dude you 're a stalker man . just ask her on a date .
thank you .
that sounds like a good idea .
thank you very much .
her father .
have you seen her before ?
good luck !
yes . here it is .
what do you mean ?
i usually go to the supermarket near the station .
so what are you going to do ?
why do you say that ?
thanks for reminding me . i 'll continue to exercise as soon as i finish this project .
i do n't know .
that is true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people .
why do you say that ?
really ? what 's that ?
it 's half past seven .
and your name please ?
i have no idea .
i am sorry to hear that . would you mind coming with me ?
it 's a job .
oh yes .
yeah . it 's perfect .
that 's a good idea . i think we will soon come to a solution to the problem .
thanks a lot . i 'm so touched .
you know what ?
i 'm glad you like it .
well i like playing basketball .
what do you mean ?
what 's the matter with you ?
well i like to play the piano .
well i do n't really like seeing bloody frames but i appreciate the <unk> frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
how do you think they could be ended ?
maybe you are right .
thank you very much .
once a week .
what do you mean ?
this one .
where are you going to ?
sure .
thank you very much .
welcome .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love it .
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's terrible .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
sure that sounds great .
um let me see romance comedy .
that is to say you like all <unk> except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
it 's true .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or <unk> friends is a way of <unk> friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people <unk> to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid .
you lose face by <unk> to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends .
i got you . next time . i 'll preface a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
just word of mouth .
i 'm not sure . . .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ?
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a <unk> and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn ?
in college .
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
i like it .
tango is my favorite . anything but hiphop or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure .
fine .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
really ?
yes i do .
it 's really expensive .
let me take a look . it 's nothing serious .
what was the weather like in new york ?
hmm . . .
it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . do you feel thirsty most of the day ?
i have no idea .
oh how nice !
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
how long will it take to get there ?
why did n't you just buy another battery for it so you could use ?
i got it .
why ?
it was three all .
what did he do ?
yes i did .
thank you very much .
that 's right .
what did you think ?
i do n't know . but i ca n't tell you .
i see . you must be stoked .
well i do n't know .
i got it .
yes . and he is the president of the company .
what do you think about it ?
he 's a hero .
oh no . . .
you have to pay for it .
yes . it 's pretty exciting .
no problem .
why not ?
yes i will .
why do n't you wear a scarf ?
all right . see you later .
hmm . . . you know the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?
what did you do ?
sure . what is it ?
i 've never thought about it like that before .
do you have any hobbies ?
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
i have no idea .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
thank you .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but .
is there anything else i should pay attention to ?
i m fine . thank you .
how about the countryside ?
what seems to be the problem ?
all right . thank you very much .
yeah it 's so funny .
i went a global warming .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves .
like what ?
basketball and swimming .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue .
let me see . that one goes for 17 .
would you take 12 ?
no i can t .
13 . 50 ?
yes sir .
i 'd love to . thank you .
is that all ?
it s honey .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
it 's flight no .
wow that 's cutting it close !
it 's at . . . gate 14 .
thank you !
so what ?
i see .
i 'm a teacher .
what do you need ?
thank you for your warning .
what are you going to do ?
i 'm not sure .
yes here you are .
how much is it ?
anything else ?
great !
my husband and i had no idea .
and when would you like to move in ?
because you can see the stars perfectly .
that 's too bad .
oh no .
that 's true .
i got it .
i did n't know that .
i was seventeen .
that s true .
no .
congratulations !
no i 'm not .
i am so sorry to hear that .
i have been married for three years .
that 's great .
i do n't know .
yes i think so .
there are 15 people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we are identical .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai .
i don t know much about him .
what about your stepbrother s mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yes i did .
i see .
it 's no wonder .
it does n't look good .
really ? what happened ?
it was busy .
what did he do ?
he 's tall and strong .
you 're right . he 's a hard worker easy to get along with honest and he never steals the credit on projects . the only thing he 's lacking in is experience .
maybe he 's abnormal .
do n't worry about it .
nothing .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
what was your childhood like ?
i had a pretty strict .
where did you go to university ?
of course . they are very friendly .
why not ?
i went to pcc .
what is your current occupation ?
i am a journalist .
could you tell me your name please ?
what do you mean ?
do you like your current job ?
i signed up for it .
that 's too bad .
yes .
that s interesting . they must be thinking of moving into that market .
my husband and i have thought about it .
well i ve always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention .
don t you think you would miss having other people around ?
i do n't think so .
if china didn t have such a policy can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
that 's true . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better .
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know .
sure i will .
are you going to cook anything ?
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what about here ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i am not sure .
about 70 i think .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great .
how about your family ?
he 's fine .
why ? what happened ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties .
yes i think you 're right . thanks for your advice .
is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
yes there is .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed it from nick .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
i see . thanks a lot .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much .
well talk to him about it next time you see him .
no we didn t . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument !
i am knowledgeable and levelheaded .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
what do you mean ?
i absolutely agree with you .
how long have you been there ?
sure you are right .
really ? why ?
yes you are right .
yes . we say eat well and drink well .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over .
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought .
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa .
no not very much .
i agree . i like his brother paul .
yes . they are completely different .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i m polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy !
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first .
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world !
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i have no idea .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i m ready looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ?
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ?
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number .
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is .
what s the kitchen like ?
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city .
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance .
so what did you get them ?
it 's all in the bag .
what s wrong with it ?
i believe it was declined .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models .
not really . i like looking on the internet .
no . i m a little worried about security . you never who s trying to find out your codes and passwords . aren t you worry about that ?
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites you should be ok .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ?
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
yes .

half past seven .
what kind of food do you want to go to ?

what do you mean ?
that s true . but i am a fast learner and i am willing to work overtime and i do not mind a lot of business travel . as you know i majored in computer programming in the university . i 've <unk> a desire to get a job where i can apply my knowledge . i know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world and i wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . that s why i applied for this job . now i am studying hotel english in my college and i am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . i am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers . in addition i learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues .
i m a keyboard operator .

it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .

good idea .

ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
thanks a lot .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important ?
yes i think so .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position .
that 's a good idea . let 's go over the weekend .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
are you sure that 's high enough ?
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
that 's very kind of you . thank you very much .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?

absolutely .
i wish you good luck !
i know what you mean . i ca n't stand computer geeks .
how much is it ?
i will .
how about your other siblings ? do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
is that right ?
why ?
how much is it ?
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price .
what is your proposal ?
12 .
do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ?
exactly .
could you make it 4500 ?

certainly . here you are .
i want to have a haircut .
that 's fine .
all right .
well what do you think ?
it 's like this . there are only one or two ships sailing a month from new york to osaka while sailings from hong kong are quite frequent . if shipment were effected from hong kong we could receive the goods much .
that 's true . what kind of safety features are we talking about ?
that 's fine . i 'd like to be on the aisle anyway . it 's easier to get in and out .
thank you .
it 's excellent .
oh i see .
sure we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the tshirt .
all right . i 'll take it .
for example ?
sounds good . i ll take this one .
the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .

beautifully done .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
what 's the matter ?
it is ok with me .
yes please . thank you very much .
what is the problem ?
i don t know .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago .
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off .
thank you so much .

yes it 's still available .
that 's great . thank you very much .
what kinds do you have ?

i see .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate ?
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient .
you re welcome .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
what do you mean ?
me too .
no problem .
that sounds like a good idea .
buckle up .
what do you mean ?
thanks for letting me know .
you are welcome .
please fill out .
i need at least 75000 per year .

your flight takes off .
here you are .

so what are you going to do ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
to be honest i don t think the boss will like us to do that .
my pleasure !
i was just there a couple of days ago .
yes i m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager .
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a threeyearold son .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers .
yes my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
what do you mean ?

ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon .
that s right . we ll finish them just in time .
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
how long will the trip take ?
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now .
they usually go on for ages .
do you have any hobbies ?
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
what s this sir ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired .
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
i do n't know . . .
that s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he s better trained to handle these sorts of things .
all right . i ll send a fax home . as soon as i receive a definite answer i ll make a specific inquiry .
sure .
i see .
that 's great . thank you very much .
ok . thank you very much .
that s a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?
maybe you 're right . they will have to develop alternative transportation . but it will be hard in america . too many people are used to cars . even in our movies cars .
i have no idea .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do .
i see .
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network connection ?

ok .
are you kidding ? the yen is in worse shape than the dollar !
could you please tell me something about the kitchen ?
no way ! i do n't know . but if you both determine to divorce i hope you will have an amicable split . . .
they 'll be there in about an hour .
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control . that is our bottom line . if you can meet that price you 've got the deal . otherwise . . .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
could you tell me something about it ?
why not ?
are you serious ?
what kinds of hits are we getting on our company 's website ?
we 've heard about that festival before . it would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .
that 's right . they always talk about a need for new progressive tactics but they have n't done anything to stimulate new jobs .
i do n't think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people .
you really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information . what about the old <unk> of word mouth and print media ?
and what about the keyboard ?
thank you .
ok that 's what i think .

oh no . i did n't know that .
it was n't too bad .
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets
it was n't all that great . i mean . . .
is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it s someone gets ripoff .
you said it .
yes sir . what can i do for you ?
ok .
i ca n't believe this . i 've been here for too long . next year will be my fiveyear anniversary . i want a change of setting . besides our company is downsizing . i do n't want to stay on just to be let go .
that 's too bad ! what can i do for you ?

i think the job should make use of .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
