 thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums  mom  .  
 but what are you going to do with that pig  ?  
 i think i 'm going to keep it as a monument to what i 've learned about money  .  
tomorrow i will be the new owner of all dad 's assets  .  
 it still feels really strange to me  .  
 i know  .  i miss him terribly  .  
 how does it feel to be in charge of so much money  ?  
 i thought i would feel like i was in the lap of luxury  .  
 i guess you could choose that if you wanted  .  
 no  i think i will run things much the same way that dad did  .  
do i have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom  ?  
 no  you do not have to  .  the handbag can be taken with you  .  there is the cart at the entrance  .  
 thank you  .  i 'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby  .  is there anything that you can recommend for me  ?  
 well  how old is your baby  ?  
 no more than three  .  
 the milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages  .  i advice that you should buy the wyeth brand  the source of milk is imported from new zealand  .  
 how about its quality  ?  
 you can be assured of it  .  there are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies bone and cerebrum  .

 it is feedingbottle as the free gift  .  
we will go to climb up the hill tomorrow  .  let 's go to supermarket to buy some food  .  
 yes  we can have a picnic on the top of the hill  .

 let me see  .  we should go to buy some fruit first  .  
 it is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top  .  
 how about taking a cantaloupe  ?  it is light and sweet  .  children love it  .  
 good idea  .  we can buy some candy and nuts for children  .  
 yes  .  look  cashew  peanuts  assorted biscuits  chocolate  canned goods  anything else  ?  
 that 's enough for the kids  .  get some drinks  .  
 definitely beer  .  two bottles  .

damn scott  .  you got big  .  
 yeah  i 've been working out a lot  .  
 how long have you been lifting weights  ?  
 for a year and a half  .  
 yeah  .  last time i saw you  it was like 2 years ago  .  
 has it been that long  ?  
 how often do you go to the gym  ?  
 i usually go every other day for about 3 hours  .  
 that 's a lot  .  
 yeah  i used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week  and i saw no results  .  this is what you have to do to get noticeable results  .  
 i do n't think i have the discipline for that  .  
what do you do besides work and watching tv  ?  
 when i have some time  i like to exercise  .  
 do you go jogging or do you go to a health club  ?  
 i joined samsung health club a couple of months ago  .  
 how do you exercise  ?  
 i usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the carpio  and then i lift weight for about 45 minutes  .  
 how often do you go  ?  
what can i do for you  ?  
 i want to get my car washed  .  
 would you like regular car wash package  ?  
 i do n't know what you mean  .  
 well  we will wash the exterior form top to bottom  .  we use a special shampoo  which gives the body that extra shine  .  
 do you wash windows  ?  
 of course  .  we wash the windows inside and out  .

 mmm  .  maybe another time  .  
 you could try the ravioli  .  they are rather like your chinese dumplings  and the sauce is delicious  .

 oh  .  you 're right  .  i misread the ad  .

 certainly  .  i would recommend songshuguiyu  .  
 the name sounds fascinating  .  what is it exactly  ?  
 well  it is sweet and sour fried mandarin fish  .  
 sorry  i 'm not interested in vinegar  .  
 then  how about this one  ?  
 ok  .  i 'll have that  .  
 very good  .  could i serve you anything else  ?  
 thank you  .  that 's enough  .  
 my pleasure  .  just a little while  your order will be ready very soon  .  please enjoy your lunch  .  
let 's see  .  i had the salmon starter which was  5 . 90 and my pizza was  8 . 25  .  
 i had the soup and bruschetta which all together is  4 . 50 and my trout for the main course was  12  .  
 so that 's  14 . 15 for me and  16 . 50 for you  .  
 yes and shall we go fiftyfifty for the wine  ?  
 yes  so that 's an extra  6 for both of us  .  
 so now your bill comes to  20 . 15 and i need to pay  22 . 50  .  
 and i had a dessert  that 's another  3 . 50  .  and you had coffee which is  2  .  
 and is that all  ?  
 yes  this is everything on the list  .  
 so now my bill is  24 . 50 and yours come to  23 . 65  .  is that correct  ?  
 yes  that 's exactly it  .  how much tip shall we give the waiter  ?  
good evening  .  
 good evening  .  we 've a reservation for a table for four  .  my name is tim  .  
 let me check the list  .  yes  we do have a reservation under mr  .  tim  .  
 but there is a change in the number of people  .  there are seven of us  .  three of my friends are coming soon  .  
 it does n't matter  .  follow me  please  .  what do you think of the table in the center of the dining room  ?  
 well  it 's a window table that we 've booked  .  
 i 'm sorry  but you see  all the tables by the window are small  with up to 4 seats  .  
 oh  i see  .  we 'll have to make up with the center one  .  
 thank you for your understanding  mr  .  tim  .  
 if a mr  .  wu comes to look for me  just take him here  .  
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking  .  
 we should plan to move out of here before july  .  i 'm tired of living in apartments  .  
 i know  dear  .  i am too  .  but we 've just been too busy to look for a house  .  
 we need to find a good realtor  .  
 not necessary  .  if we use a realtor to find a house  it will be more expensive  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 realtors always get a commission  .  if the realtor helps us find something  we have to pay him  .  
 but does n't a realtor help with the contract  ?  i thought they take care of all the legal troubles  .  
 yes  that 's often true  .  but you have to pay them  .  
 i still think we should have a realtor  .  we 're new in this country  .  we do n't know all the laws of buying a house  .  and also  the realtor will inspect the house  .  he can tell us if the house has any problems  .  
 of course we need a house inspector  .  but we can hire an inspector on our own  .  as for the legal problems  i have friends  .  they can help us  .  
 so how can we find a house if we do n't have a realtor  ?  
 it takes a little more time  .  we have to check the ads in the paper  .  probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads  .  then we have to drive to the homes and look at them  .  
 and does n't the person selling the house have a realtor  ?  
 sometimes they do  sometimes they do n't  .  it 's best to find someone who is selling by themselves  .  
 why  ?  
 that is because if the seller has a realtor  their price will be higher  .  he will have to pay a commission to the realtor  .  
 hmm  .  it all sounds very complicated  .  
 it is  .  but buying a house is very important  .  so it takes time  .  that 's why we have n't done it yet  .  it 's very troublesome  .  
 i want to look in the papers today  .  maybe we can see something we like  .  
where to  madam  ?  
 grand central station  please  .  i want to catch a 6 p  .  m  .  train  .  
 i think you 'll make it if we do n't get stuck in a traffic jam  .  
 here is the grand central station  .  
 thank you  .  how much is the fare  ?  
 the meter reads 9 . 15 dollars  .

what do you think about all the different diets people go on  ?  
 i do n't think dieting is good for you  .  it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with  !  
 but what do you think about people who are obese  ?  what should they do to lose weight  ?  
 they need to eat healthy foods  but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day  .  they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether  though  .  
 so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate  ?  
 sure  they can eat some chocolate  .  as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods  there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert  .  
 how about drinking soda  ?  
 many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda  .  soda should be a treat  there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever  .  if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda  try some diet coke  .  
 that 's good advice  .  have you ever tried taking vitamins  ?  
 my mother used to make me take vitamins every day  but i do n't take them anymore  .  vitamins are good as a supplement  but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start  .  
 how do you know so much about food and dieting  ?  
i 'm sorry  but i did n't catch what you said  .  
 i said   do you want me to help you  ?   
 if you 're sure you 're not in a hurry  i can use a little help  .  
hi  mark  .  
 hi  bill  .  i  d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday  .  
 all right  .  
 so  what do we do now  ?  
 this is the lease  .  you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant  .  the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords  .  
 okay  .   reads the lease  so  according to the lease  i  ll deposit one month  s rent as a security deposit  and i have to pay the first month  s rent in advance  .  i understand that i  ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs  .  
 yes  .  if you do not damage the apartment  you will get your security deposit back when you move out  .  
 can i pay you by check  ?  
 sure  .  a check will be fine  .  
 is there a laundry room in the basement  ?  
 yes  .

 i am wondering if you do facial care  ?  
 yes  we do  .

 from 200 to 800  .  
 i 'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me  .  could you recommend something around 300  ?  
i 'm sorry  but i did n't catch what you said  .  
 i said  do you want me to help you  ?  
 i 'm trying to find a post office  .

 yes  i want to buy a suit  .  
 what about the red one  ?  it 's the best seller  .  
 yeah  it 's quite cute  .  i do n't think it will fit me  .  i would prefer a darker color  .  have you a black one  ?  
check the mirror  .  how do you like it  ?  
 i think the style is a little oldfashioned  .  it 's not what i want  .  
 i think this one fits you  .  it 's the new fashion style  .  
well  this is not quite the style i want  .  have you any suit in fashion  ?

 we  re glad that you  re here  .  would you like a tour of the house  ?  
 that  d be great  but could i have a cup of tea first  ?

 that would be lovely  thanks  .  
 do you take milk or sugar with your tea  ?  
 i  ll take a little milk  but no sugar  please  .  make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup  .  
 ok  .  what do you think about our living room  ?  
 well  i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table  but i don  t really care for curtains  .  did you get them at a yard sale  ?  they look ancient  .  
 my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift  .

 yes  you are right  .  
 is it far  ?  
 no  it 's only about five minutes walk  .  
 thank you very much  .  
would you like to see our new shirts  ?  
 sorry  i 'm not really that interested in those things  .

alright  tell me what you think  .  
 do n't you think it  s a bit bright  ?  
 yeah  maybe you  re right  .  how about this outfit  ?  
 this dress looks lovely on you  but it  s not very practical  is it  ?  
 no  i do n't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon  but i love the way it looks  .  i just had to try it on  !  what do you think about this  ?  it  s casual  yet sophisticated  .  
 i like the jeans  but you need something to go with the top  .  it  s too plain on its own  .  
 how about this scarf  these earrings  amd an anklet  ?  
 that might be going overboard a bit  .  how about just that scarf with a bracelet  ?  
 that  s a good idea  .  you have a lot of good fashion sense  .  
 thanks  .  you  d be ok on your own  .  there are loads of fashion victims out there  and you are not one of them  .  have you tried it on yet  ?  
 yep  .  here it is  .  what do you think  ?  
 that looks great  .  just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans  .  do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them  ?  
 the leopard print sounds fabulous  .  are they a name brand  ?  
 no  they  re a prada knockoff for 110 of the price of the real thing  .  
 that  s even better than the real thing  .  
 if i were you  i  d buy that now while it  s on sale  .  if you spend  100  you get a  50 voucher for more clothes  .  
this suit looks nice . can i try it on  ?  
can i help you  ?  
hello  may i speak to kevin  please  ?

 we are open until 10 but our last order for dinner is at 930 pm  .  
 fine  .  well be there before then  .  
do you like shopping at flea markets  ?  
 l love it  .  there is always something fascinating to discover  .  
 the antiques market here in paris is very famous  .  it 's called le marche aux puces de saintouen  .  
 that 's not very easy to say  .  
 it 's also known as les puces  which means  the fleas  .  
 can you find many bargains there  ?  
how nice these frames are  !  
 yes  they are the latest designs  .  would you like to try them on  ?  
 i want to try on this pair  .  
 the oval shape one  ?  
 that 's right  .  
 i think it suits you well  .  
 i agree  but i like wire frames  .  
can i get you something to drink  ?  
 sure  but i do n't drink much  .  so i do n't know what to order  .  
 so how about an aperitif  ?  
 it sounds good  .  i 'd like to start with a compare  .  
 stirred or shaken  ?  
 stirred will be fine  .  
 here you are  .  
 thanks  .  does the bar have a signature drink  ?  
 sure  .  all of our mixed drinks are excellent  .  you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail  .  
 can you recommend one  ?  
 try a stinger  .  it has lime juice and grenadine over ice  .  
 it sounds interesting  .  i 'll take one  .  
 here we go  .  
 it tastes great  .  
 enjoy yourself  .  
wow  !  it 's hot today  !  do you want to get an ice cream cone  ?  
 no let 's go to an ice cream parlor  !  they have way more flavors to choose from there  .  i feel like having something special like neapolitan ice cream  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 it 's three different flavors mixed together  .  chocolate  strawberry and something green with candied fruit  .  
 do they have ice cream bars  .  frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse  ?  
 absolutely  !  they also have real italian galatian and french sorbets  .  they do a great baked alaska  .  
 maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good  .  what 's your favorite flavor  ?  
 well  .  .  .  l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin  butter pecan  .  maple walnut  strawberry  chocolate and vanilla  .  but now there are some new flavors from asia like green tea and durian  .  
 god  !  even talking about it makes me feel like l 'm gaining weight  !  
sally  what do we have for dinner 
 what would you like to have  ?  
 well  i quit breakfast  so i had a rich brunch  .  i feel like having something mild for dinner 
 in that case  what about having some noodles  ?  
 noodles are fine  .  or maybe i 'll have some porridge  .  
waiter  i  m afraid you must have calculated my bill wrong  .  
 there  s a possibility  .  i  ll check it  .  
 thank you  .  
how do you like the food here  ?  
 i do n't like it very much . but everybody likes their own food best  .  
 there are many things i miss  .  you ca n't get the ingredients here  .  
 are you sure  ?  all the big cities have specialty shops  which sell all sorts of ethnic foods  .  
there are so many record players here  .  that is hard to choose  .  
 look at this one  .  it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers  .  
 i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound  .  
 yes  but we should n't get any thing too big  .  remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture  .  
 that 's right  .  now this one looks alright  ?  it 's a detached or do you prefer this one  ?  it 's sony  .  
i can  t find my purse  .  have you seen it  ?  
 no  i haven  t  .  
 i  ve looked everywhere for it  .  i must have left it somewhere  .  i hope i haven  t lost it  .  
 perhaps you left that at school  .  
 no  i had it when i left school this afternoon  .  
 well  .  didn  t you go around to the smith after school  ?  you might have left it there  .  
 yes  i  d better give her a call now  .  
 but she can  t be home now  .  she might have gone to the library  .  
could i see the manager please  ?  i have a complaint to make  .  
 yes  i  m the manager here  .  what can i do for you  madam  ?  
 did you have the room checked before we move in  ?  
 which room are you in  ?  
 1808  .  the toilet doesn  t work properly  the water doesn  t run in the shower  .  
excuse me  .  
 yes  sir  .  can i help you  ?  
 um  this steak  i asked for to be medium rare  .  
 medium rare  that  s right  sir  .  i remember your order  .  
 well  i  m afraid it isn  t  .  it  s a bit too well done and rather tough  .  would you mind changing  ?  
 if it is not to your satisfaction  i  ll certainly bring you another  .  but i  m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes  .  
i 'm worrying that she may be lost  .  
 be relaxed  .  she is familiar with the area  .  
 after all  she is a fiveyearold kid  .  
i 've typed the report  .  
 well done  .  
 and i 've filed the letters  .  
 excellent job  .  
 and i 've checked the orders  .  
 i 'm very impressed  .  
 and i 've ordered the supplies  .  
i feel terribly bored  .  i 'm going to take a job  .  
 good  .  
 then i can buy my own car  .  
 splendid  .  
 and pay for my own clothes  .  
come to think of it  there is one rule in this house  mary  .  
 what is it  ?  
 when you go out with friends  i do n't want you to stay out too late  .  
 okay  .  
 we maintain a curfew for cindy because she 's just 16  .  
 how late can we stay out  ?  
 you can stay out till 10 p  .  m  .  
 but if we 're going to be late  ?  
lisa  are there family rules in this house  ?  
 well  i would n't call them rules  but there are some things that i expect my daughter to do  .  
 like what  ?  
 setting the table and doing the dishes  .  
 is there anything else  ?  
 i also expect cindy to tidy up her own room  .  
 her room is very neat and clean  .  
 yeah  .  she 's a very responsible person  .  
excuse me  but could you tell me the way to the railway station  ?  
 the railway station  ?  just go down this street and turn left at the second corner  .  the station is at the end of that street  .  
 how long will it take me to get there  ?  
 it 's about a tenminute walk  .  
 that 's very clear  .  i think i can find my way now  .  thank you  .  
say  jim  how about going for a few beers after dinner  ?  
 you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness  .  
 what do you mean  ?  it will help us to relax  .  
 do you really think so  ?  i do n't  .  it will just make us fat and act silly  .  remember last time  ?  
 i guess you are right  .  but what shall we do  ?  i do n't feel like sitting at home  .  
 i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong  .  perhaps we can make a foursome with them  .  
 sounds great to me  !  if they are willing  we could ask them to go dancing with us  .  that is excellent exercise and fun  too  .  
 good  .  let 's go now  .  
hello  .  this is hamilton  s heating and cooling service  .  can i help you  ?  
 yes  .  my home freezer is not working properly  .  
 what  s the problem  ?  
 it keeps running all the time  never stopping  .  and it makes a strange sound  .  all the ice cream inside it melted  .  
 maybe the compressor is going bad  .  
 can you send the technician to check it out  ?  
 sure  .  but there is a minimum charge of  60 for a service visit  .  if your freezer needs parts  there will be an additional charge  .  
 okay  .  i  ll pay the charges  .  
 all right  .  let me check our technician  s schedules  .  i  ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house  .  what is your phone number  ?  
 my number is 6275551234  .  
 okay  .  i  ll call you right back  .  
 thank you  .  good bye  .

 your car is rather old  .  why not change a new one  ?  
 i want to change a new car  .  i like honda best  especially the red one  .  but it is too expensive  .  
 oh  there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon  .  i have two tickets  .  would you like to go there with me  ?  
 yeah  .  maybe i can find my favorite car in addition to honda  .  
what did the boss say  ?  
 he asked me if i 'd like to be a newspaper salesperson  ?  
 you are still student so i do n't think you should have time for that  .  
 do n't worry about that  .  he said i can do that at spare time  .  anyway  it 's just a parttime job  .  
 okay  then  .  what kind of newspaper he wants you to sell  ?  
 it 's a weekly newspaper named olympic english  .  so i need to be here only on sunday  .  
 sounds interesting  .  especially that we are olympic volunteers  .  
 that 's exactly what i am thinking about  and also it 's a good way to get social experiences  .  
 and a good way to get some pocket money  .  
 let 's do it together  .  
 i 'll say yes  .  wait a minute  .  i need an ic card  .  
 for what  ?  you have a telephone at home  do n't you  ?  
dad  hurry  !  the train is coming  .  aha  i am a superman  .  
 do n't rush  behave yourself please  !  let the people get off first  .  
 oh  we should  .  there are so many people  .  what if the train got full before we could get in  ?  
 but  if we all pushed our way in  nobody could get off  and nobody could get in either  .  
 how many stops are there to the aidan station  ?  
 there are four more stops  .  
 oh  my god  !  
 what 's wrong  ?  you are like a little monkey  on pins and needles  !  
 because i need to use the restroom  .  is there a restroom on the train  ?  
 no  not on the train  but in the station  .  
 why not  ?  you told me that subway is a kind of train  .  if it had no restroom  .  what kind of train would that be  ?  
 well  that is a question  .  you want to offer a suggestion  ?  
 oh  yeah  but not today  .  i am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible  .  
excuse me  ?  can you do me a favor  please  ?  
 it 's my pleasure  what can i do for you  ?  
 i 'm from england and i 'm trying to make a travel plan for today  .  
 what brings you here  ?  
 i 'm a flight attendant and i 'm here on vacation  .  
 where are you staying  ?  
 i live in the holiday inn lido hotel  .  
 oh  it 's not very far  .  and as far as i know it is a fancy place  .  
 yes  it is  .  do you know where i can get a town map  ?  
 we sell them  right here  .  
daniel  here is some money for the tickets  .  
 ok  it 's my pleasure  .  how many tickets  ?  
 oh  like a gentleman  .  two tickets for two people  .  
 but i am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets  .  
 they may unless we get a halfprice ticket for you  .  
 dad  it makes no sense  .  
 you may ask if you can take a halfprice ticket  .  
i 've heard that you provide very good service  so when i need a mover  i call you guys first  .  
 thanks a lot for calling us  .  could you tell me more about what you need us to do  ?  
 oh  you see  we are on the 8th floor  and moving into the 6th floor in another building  .  it is about 15 kilometers to get there  .  
 ok  the cost depends on the floor to move to  the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move  .  
 how much will it cost in that case  ?  
 oh  let me see  .  it fits the second standard rates  .  have a look at the contract  please  .  
 your charge is divided into two parts  the payment in advance and the rest  .  i thought that i should pay all of it before moving  .  
 no  firstly we sign the contract  you pay 50  of what it costs  and the rest when we finish moving  .  
 the damage and compensation item confuses me  .  could you give some explanation  ?  
that was really a nightmare  !  
 honey  what 's up  ?  
 i was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator  .  
 oh  really  ?  i know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft  so what did you do then  ?  
 i pressed the emergency button  !  and then i stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue  .  
 did you panic at the time  ?  
 a little bit  but i know that the elevator is n't enclosed  .  at least i would n't be smothered there  .  
 was there anyone else with you  ?  
 of course  there are 6 other people in the elevator  they were so scared that someone even started crying  .  
 so you mean that you were the only brave one there  ?  
 yes  .  i have to call the property management  .  
 for what  ?  complaining about what happened in the elevator  ?  
 yes  .  they should check the elevator regularly  .  i have to give them something to remember about  and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building  .  
 that was just an accident  .  you are worried too much about it  .  i think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on  .  
hi  my name is ted  what 's yours  ?  
 what  ?  
 i said  i 'm ted  who are you  ?  
 huh  ?  oh  my name is laura  .  
 do you come here often  laura  ?  
 huh  ?  i ca n't hear you  the music 's too loud  .  
 let 's go outside and talk  .  so laura  do you come here often  ?  
 hold on  my ears are still ringing from the music  .  .  .  what was it you asked me  ?  
 i asked if you come here often  .  
 sometimes  usually once every few weeks  .  do you  ?  
 no  this is my first time here  .  
 i usually come with a group of friends  .  we dance a little  have a few drinks  and just have a good time  .  
 yeah  that 's why i 'm here  .  my friends dragged me here  because they think i spend too much time studying  .  
 that 's good  .  it 's good to hit the books  but you need to get out once in a while  .  
why are you reading the classifieds  ?  what do you need  ?  
 i 'm looking for a bookcase  but i do n't want to buy a new one  .  
 are you having any luck  ?  
 not really  .  there are n't any used bookcases listed  .  but there are a few rummage sales on saturday  .  i think i 'll go to them  .  
 do you mind if i go with you  ?  
 not at all  .  these private sales are great places to bargain  .  and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk  .  
 i learned to negotiate from my mother  .  i thought i was pretty good at bargaining  but i had a problem the other day at kimble 's department store  .  
 what happened  ?  
so what do you think of my new dress  ?  
 i think it 's great  !  i really like the color  and it goes really well with your eyes  .  i 've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine 's for a while now  but i was n't sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment  .  
 um  ninetyfive dollars  ?  
 yes  that 's the price they were advertising it at  .  i was hoping it might go on sale soon  .  why  how much did you pay for it  ?  
 i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen's boutique  .  i did n't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else  .  
 of course  !  everything at helen's is overpriced  and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store  !  why did n't you shop around  ?  
come in and have some coffee  anna  .  the kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends  .  
 i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday  .  
 they spend hours there  especially on weekends  .  
 speaking of that trip  alan bought a shirt at a department store  but the sleeves are too long  .  do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them  ?  
 i know several  .  but would n't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size  ?  
 is n't that complicated  ?  
 no  it 's easy  .  we 'll just take the shirt back to the men  s department and show them the sales slip  .  they 'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund  .  
 we  ?  do you want to go with me  ?  
 sure  .  i love going to the mall  .  
watch out  !  you 'll hit that car if you 're not careful  .  
 oh no  i wo n't  .  but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting  .  
 you see  .  i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful  .  
 oh  shut up  will you  ?  it was all your fault  .  if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened  .  
why do n't we get ourselves a new car  ?  the old one 's falling apart  .  
 what a good idea  !  
 what kind shall we get  ?  
 we could go to more places this time  if you liked  .  
 yes  fine  .  
 when shall we go and look  ?  
 why not sometime next week  ?  
 no  let 's go on saturday  .  
 ok  .  
 where shall we go  ?  
 there 's a car dealer down the road  .  how about going there  ?

hi  .  i 'm looking for some good deals on produce  .  
 you might want to try the mangoes  .  
 can you describe a mango to me  ?  
 it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit  .  it has a big seed in it  .  
 do i eat the seed  ?  
 maybe some animals eat the seed  but humans do n't  .  you 'd have to soak it for 10 years  .  
 what 's the price of these mangoes  ?  
 today you get a 50  percent discount  .  they 're only  1 each  .  
 tell me what they taste like  .  
 their flesh is soft and juicy  .  it has a citrus taste  .  it 's sweet  .  
 do i need to buy them ripe  or will they ripen at home  ?  
 just press into it gently with your thumb  .  if it feels soft  it 's ready to eat  .  
 where do mangoes come from  ?  
thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us  .

 i need it delivered tomorrow  .  will that be possible  ?  
 what time exactly  ?  
 i need it delivered at 12 o 'clock  .  
 we can have it to you at that time  .  
 that 's not a problem  ?  
 we will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o 'clock  .  
where is some fresh produce that 's on sale  ?  
 well  i think you 'll like the mangoes  .  
 i 've never had a mango  .

 the sale price today is  1 each  .  
 can you describe their taste  ?  
 they usually taste sweet  but they remind me of an orange  .

 do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside  .  
 what country produces them  ?  
welcome to al  s garage  .  what seems to be the problem  ?  
 no problem at all  !  i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition  .  
 very wise decision  .  when was the last time you had a tune up  ?  
 not that long ago  i think it was four months ago  .  
 we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers  .  
 why  ?  i mean  what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often  ?  
 first of all  we change the motor oil and oil filter  .  if you don  t do this  it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves  .  
 i see  .  what else  ?  
 we also check your spark plugs  fuel filter  and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid  .  we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones  .  
 ok  well  when you put it that way  it doesn  t seem like a waste of time and money  .  
can you tell me about some good deals on produce  ?  
 the mangoes are on sale today  .  
 what exactly are mangoes  ?  
 they have yellowish red skin  .  it 's a fruit with one big seed  .

 how much does a mango cost  ?  
 normally  they 're  2 each  .  today  they 're only  1 each  .  
 maybe i wo n't like the taste  .  
 it 's hard to describe  .  they 're sweet  but also sort of acidity  .  
 how do i tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one  ?  
 they 're similar to an avocado  .  when the outside feels soft  they 're ripe  .  
 where do most of them come from  ?  
i 'm looking for some fresh produce that 's on sale  .  
 well  we just got in some mangoes  .  
 mangoes  .  what are they  ?

 oh  no  that 's way too heavy a pan for me  .  
 here  lift this aluminum pan  .  it 's the same size  .  
 yes  it 's very lightweight  .  but i do n't want this aluminum handle  .

 oh  this feels very nice  .  it 's perfect  .  i 'll take it  .

 how about these famous brands  ?  such as pierre cardin  .  .  .  
 i 'm afraid that 's a bit beyond my means  .  
we have a great variety of men's suits  sir . which particular brand do you prefer  ?  
 pierre cardin  .  
 how about this one  ?  
i like this shirt . how much is it  ?  
  135  .  
 wow  that 's sheer robbery . shall i make an offer  ?  
my dear  it 's five flights up  !  
 that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides  it is quiet up there . we re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there 's no one living over us  .  
 is the place wellfurnished  ?  
 yes  it 's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play  .  
 what about the kitchen  ?  
 the stove and refrigerator are in good working order  and i do n't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires  .  
 are the plumbing all right  ?  
 the plumbing seems ok  too . the toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water  and the sinks do n't seem to leak  .  
have you got any cheaper ones  ?  
 here are some . they re on special sale these days  .  
drop me at the manhattan post office  .  
 well  that 's an hour 's ride . why not just post your mail here  .  
 oh  i 'm visiting a friend there  .  
holly  ?  holly madison  is that you  ?  you look great  !  you have n't changed a bit  .  
 uh  .  .  .  andrew  .  hello  .  i ca n't quite remember you  .  
 it 's me  .  the dman  !  i sat behind you in english  .  are you and taylor still dating  ?  
 um  .  .  .  we never were  .  we 're just friends  .  
 well  if you 're not seeing anyone  maybe we could  .  .  .  
ten dollars  ?  maybe there are a lot of them  .  .  .  
 seven dollars  !   !   !  incredible  !  but i saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating  .  
 was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products  ?  
 i read that someone called him a cheat and a liar  !  and i noticed that he wo n't ship abroad  .  
 some people get nasty on those comments  .  maybe you should write him and ask nicely  .  
only one  .  but i wanted to make sure i 'd get it  .  
 yeah  i really wanted that chanel bag  too  .  but just in case you should bid low  .  
 but there are only two more days until the bidding closes  !  
 i bid on a chanel watch at the last minute  and got it sixty percent off  !  
 oh  .  .  .  i 'm such a newbie  .  but at least i 'm sure i 'll get that tennis racket  .  
 do n't count on it  babe  .  ebay is always full of surprises  .  
so  got any more ideas for the website  ?  
 well  since we 're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes  i made a  for guests only  gift chat room  .  
 but we registered at macy 's  .  people can just buy gifts there  .  
 the taiwanese wo n't have time to buy gifts in america  .  the chat room is more convenient  .  
 you 're right  .  they can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things  .  
 or discuss what gifts they could buy together  .  
 any other ideas  ?  
 we can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments  .  
 and we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures  .  .  .  
 yeah  that will be the best part  .  jack has n't seen yours yet  right  ?  
i decided to give it a go  !  
 good for you  .  what items did you bid on  ?  
 a deny shirt and one of serena williams used tennis rackets  !  
 your idol  !  wow  !  you 're even better at finding stuff than me  !  
 yep  .  i placed a bid for the shirt  .  the minimum was ten so i bet fifty  !  
 that 's not how this game works  .  
 well  there was a sign that said  buy now for seventy  .   
but what if i do n't win what i bid on  ?  
 then it was n't meant to be  .  some people have put up a hard fight for some items i bid on  .  but i was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirtcheap  .  
 it seems that you can email the seller and ask questions  .  
 sure  .  i 've even emailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag  .  
 and people are honest  ?  
i was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to taiwan  .  
 i 'm sorry we do n't ship overseas  .  it 's too much trouble  .  
 i understand you do n't have a history of shipping overseas  but i am willing to pay extra for shipping  .  
 maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid  .  
 thanks so much  !  by the way  is the racket really serena williams   ?  
brooke  i have bad news  .  
 what  !  
 i called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today  .  
 do n't you dare tell me that  .  .  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i did n't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats  .  
 well  they should have called you  !  
 they said that they did  .  i 've been so busy  .  .  .  
 and you did n't think to leave them my cell phone  ?  
 i did n't think there would be a problem  .  
 it 's the holidays  !  everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets  !  
 i 'm sorry  .  we 're still going  .  i got reservations for all of us on the 31st  .  it will be ok  .  trust me  .  
 trust you  !  you ca n't even handle simple plane reservations  !  
ok  .  i just saw a versace for thirty dollars  .  this stuff ca n't be real  !  
 most of it is  .  you should sign up  .  
 i 'm not sure i 'd want to give these people my credit card number  .  
 did n't you read about paypal and bidpai  ?  they are very safe  .  
 sure  but it 's so complicated  .  they asked for my credit card authorization number  .  
 that 's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is  .  
merry christmas  sweetie  .  how 's your brother enjoying taiwan  ?  
 ryan says he wants to stay  .  i think he 's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters  .  .  .  
 no  !  christmas without him is bad enough  .  so  honey  do you have cold feet yet  ?  
 yeah  especially since jack did n't take care of the plane reservations  .  
 you 're not coming  ?  
 not until the 31st  .  so can you change the church reservations  ?  
 i 'm afraid not  .  the church is booked until the year 2001  .  
 then where will we have the ceremony  ?  at home  ?  
 we 'll have to  .  we 'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd  .

 it is too expensive for me  .  do you have something cheaper  ?

 well  depends  .  you see  there are eight famous chinese food cuisines  for instance  sichuan cuisine and hunan cuisine  .  
 there 're all spicy or hot of heard  .  
 that  s right  .  if you have hot dishes  you can try some  .  
 it might be too hot for me  .  
 and there are cantonese cuisine and kiangsu cuisine  .  .  most people like them  .

 these accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days  .  
 yeah  it looks like we  re in for a long drive  .  
 ah  well  .  put on the news  .  i got up late and missed it  .  
i need to find a new place to live  .

 oh  it  s not you  .  i just want my own place  .  
 well  check the newspaper  .  
 jeez  .  .  .  i didn  t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days  .  
 yeah  prices have really gone up the past couple of years  .  
 oh  here  s one  .  it  s looks like its in this neighborhood   600 a month  .  that  s not to bad  .

 the international airport  please  .  i have to be there by 8 
 i ca n't promise anything  but i 'll try my best  .  
 oh  that 's my stop  .  how much do i need to pay  ?  
 that 'll be 10 dollars  please  .  
where is it  ?  
 i 'm going to the golden hotel  .  
 get in  please  .  
 thank you  .  i have an appointment with an important client at 10 
 do n't worry  you 'll be there plenty of time  .  that is it  .  7 . 15   please  .  
hello  .  
 this is soft  may i speak to lamely  ?  
 this is lamely  .  
 hello  lamley . are you free tomorrow  ?  
 yes  .  
 would you like to go to an activation with me  ?  
 i 'd like to . see you tomorrow  .  
i 'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised  .  
 yes  we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated  .  
 that sounds fantastic  !  but i am looking for something closer to downtown  as i spend most of my time at the office  .  
 no problem  .  we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square  .  it 's perfect for people busy with office work  .  it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details  .  
 i 'm sure they are wonderful  but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost  .  
 ah  !  i get your point  .  we have just what you need  .  our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans  .  the one bedroom apartments are very economical  but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space  .  i think you can find a very apartment there  .  
 great  !  i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon  .  could you tell me the detailed dress  ?  
 of course  .  it 's just at 19 lingual road  .  you can phone me again if you ca n't find the right place  .  
a friend told me might find a room here  .  
 yes  .  i 'll have a room free next week  .  
 what do you charge  ?  
 12000 yuan a year  but you ca n't have visitors live in it  .  
 ok  .  would it be all right to look at the room first  ?  
marketing manage office  can i help you  ?  
 mr green  please  .  
 sorry  he 's out  .  
 what time you suspect back them  ?  
 sorry  i am not sure  can i take a message  ?  
 no  thanks  .  i 'll call back later  .  
 that 's fine . please call again later  .  
this is the house i want to rent  .  
 could you tell me the advantages of it  ?  
 no problem  .  first  it 's comfortable and cozy  .  second  it has a lovely view of the city  .  third  it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need  such as refrigerator  electric stove  heating apparatus  washing machine and dishwasher  .  forth is the most important  the electricity is free of charge  .  finally  it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient  .  
 there is something in what you said  but what is the rent  ?  
 200 dollars per week  .  
 in my opinion  the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas  .  
 it certainly is  .  but to tell you the truth  the room is so large that i can share it with someone else  and that will decrease the total amount of the rent  .  
 your intention is good  but i still ca n't agree with you  .  if no one would like to share it with you  you have to pay it all by yourself  .  
 do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it  s easy to go anywhere from here and it  s near the place where i work  ?  
 i agree with you in this way  .  but how often do you go to work or shopping per week  ?  
 twice a week for work and once for shopping  .  
 in my opinion  you have to go to the university every day  and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university  .  
tommy played truant today  .  his teacher called me this morning  .  
 where did he go  ?  
 i 've asked him  but he wo n't tell me  .  what should we do about this  ?  he is like you  .  i remember when we were at the college  you always skipped classes  .  
 like me  ?  but you see i am so successful now  .  and if he is really like me  he will be more successful than me in the future  .  
 stop  stop  .  .  .  we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study  .  maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school  .  
 pay him  ?  but he studies for himself  not for you or for me or for anybody else  .  i got an idea  .  you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins  you can go to work  .  
 in that way  i 'll be late every day  .  how about letting him go to school on school bus  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  why have i never thought of that  ?  
hello  anna speaking  !  
 hey  anna  this is jason  .  
 jason  where have you been hiding lately  ?  you know it 's been a long time since your last call  .  have you been good  ?

 that 's good  .  so i guess i 'll have to make an appointment to see you  .  
 you are kidding  .  
 how long have you been working there  ?  
 a bit over two years  .  this is a fastmoving company  and seniority isn  t the only factor in deciding promotions  .  
 how do you like your new boss  ?  
 she is very nice and openminded  .  
 much better than the last one  huh  ?  
 yeah  .  he was a real slave driver  .  he probably would have loved it if we were robots  .  
 forget about him  .  come over to my house tonight  .  let 's get drunk  .  
 good  .  tonight 8 o 'clock  .  
 8 it is  .  see you then  .

 i  d like a half a pound of ground beef  please  .  
 good choice  !  our ground beef is extra lean  if you know what i mean  .  
 could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts  ?  
 no  no no no chicken breasts at the moment  but we have some nice chicken thighs  .  
 no  that won  t do  .  i  ll take this smoked ham you have here  .  
 okay  is there anything else  ?  
 is this salami and bologna you have here  ?  
 yes  !  it  s very fine meat  !  made it myself  .  .  .  
 sounds good  .  okay  that  s it  .  
 wait  !  we have tbone  rib eye  and sirloin steaks  .  they are very fresh  !  just came from the slaughter house  .  .  .  
 mmm  .  .  .  no that  s okay  really  .  i think that  s all for today  .  
hello sir  how may i help you  ?  
 i would like to buy some flowers  please  .  something really nice  .  
 i see  may i ask what the occasion is  ?  
 it  s not really an occasion  it  s more like i  m sorry  .  
 very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends  .  it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out  .  it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness  .  
 i think i  m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear  .  what else do you recommend  ?  
 mmm  well this is our i  m sorry i cheated on you package  .  two dozen red roses lined with tulips  carnations and lilies  .  the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you  .  
 i don  t think that  s gonna cut it  .  i need something bigger and better  !  
 i  m sorry sir but  what exactly did you do  ?  
 well  i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier  .  
so can you fix it  ?  
 i  m sorry sir  .  this computer is not broken or damaged  .  it  s simply just too old  !  that  s why your programs and applications are running slow  .  there really isn  t much i can do  .  
 what do you mean  ?  i bought this computer just three years ago  !  
 yes  but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster  !  
 ok  i know where this is going  .  how much will it cost me to get a new computer  ?  
 well  this desktop over here is our latest model  .  it has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte  .  of course  it includes a mouse  keyboard and desk speakers  .  
 i have no idea what you are talking about  .  i just want to know if it  s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time  !  
ok  let  s go through this one more time  .  i don  t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses  !  
 i know  i know  .  ok  so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine  .  
 right  .  you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing  .  for example for delicates  you should set a shorter washing cycle  .  also  be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing  .  
 so complicated  !  ok  what about this red wine stain  ?  how do i get it out  ?  
 since this is a white tshirt  you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick  .  
 cool  .  then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it  s all set right  ?  
 no  !  since you are washing delicates and cotton  you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes  .  
ah  !  no  !  damn it  !  
 it 's a blackout  .  now i ca n't see seinfeld  .  
 so what  ?  i just lost one hour 's worth of work  .  
 really  ?  how could you do that  ?  do n't you save every couple minutes  ?  
 no  i did n't save this time . damn it  !  and i 'm sick of writing this paper  .  now i have to write it all over again too  .  
 i 've had that problem too many times  .  so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something  i save every three sentences or so  .  i do n't want to lose anything  .  
 i hate computers  .  sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth  .  
 what are we going to do now  ?  
 i do n't know  .  i feel like going out  .  
 i wonder how much of the city is down  .  
 it does n't matter  .  i still can go out and buy a beer  .  
 maybe  .  but if there 's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . and besides  i know you have a political science exam tomorrow  .  i thought you had a lot of reading to do  .  
 yes  that 's true  .  damn  !  i just lost half my paper  and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen  .  
 i have a flashlight in my closet  .  if you want to use that to read  you can  .  
 thanks  .  i think i will try  .  where are you going  ?  
 i like your idea of getting a beer  .  i think i 'll go out myself  .  
 maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam  and i 'll go drink beer  ?  
 no  it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam  you wo n't know the answers tomorrow  .  i will  .  
 so  ?  you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam  .  why not  ?  
 how many students are in the class  ?  
 about fourteen  .  
 so it wo n't work  old buddy  .  they 'll see that i 'm not you  .  sorry  .  
welcome to galant  .  how can i help you  ?  
 hi  .  i would like to get an internet plan for my house  .  
 of course  .  we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from  .  the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month  .  this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps  .  
 i have no idea what kbps means  .  i just want to be able to get online  play games and chat with my friends  .  oh  and watch movies online as well  .  
 well  this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs  .  i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes  .  that way you can play games online without any lag  .  this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free  !  
 do i have to pay an installation fee  ?  
 lucky for you  this month we aren  t charging our normal installation fee  .  you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there  !  and we  ll throw in this pen drive  !  
good afternoon  !  did you call for a plumber  ?  
 yes  yes i did  .  please come in  !  i  m so glad you came  !  this old house is falling apart  !  come on into the bathroom  .  see  here  there  s water leaking everywhere  !  
 i see  .  let me have a look  .  it seems that your toilet is clogged  and that  s why it won  t flush  .  let me just get my plunger  .  no  that  s not working either  .  i suspect that there  s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that  s causing a blockage  .  that  s what  s making your toilet overflow  .  
 oh  that must be because of my fouryearold daughter  .  she is always flushing things down the toilet  .  you know how kids are  .  
 yeah  i have a little one myself  .  anyway  these water pipes are really rusty  so they also should be changed  .  thatcould be causing water to not drain completely  that might lead to more problems in the future  .  i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn  t shutting off properly  .  i could have it all finished by today if it  s urgent  .  
 that would be great  !  is it expensive  ?  
what do you think of this dress  ?  do you think it suits me  ?  
 sure  .  why don  t you try it on  ?  the fitting room is over there  .  
 it  s just the right sizea perfect fit  !  have you seen anything you like  ?  
 i  m thinking about buying this sweater  .  i know it  s june now  but it will be perfect for autumn and winter  .  
 it looks too big for you  but i like the color and the material is good quality  .  is it on sale  ?  
 yes  it  s half price  .  it  s supposed to be too largethat  s the fashion  .  
 i might get one too  but in a different color  .  i prefer light blue to white  
 there . it looks great  don  t you think  ?  i  m going to get these jeans as well  .  i need a new pair  .  i  m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter  .  
 i  m getting this beret  ?  doesn  t it look cool  ?  i  d like to get some jeans too  but i don  t have enough cash on me  .  
 don  t worry  .  i  ve got my credit card  .  you can pay me back later  .  
what do you think this flat  ?  
 it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us  .  
 small  ?  but it should be enough for our needs  i think  .  
 but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed  especially in the winter  it feels good  .  
 that 's true  but i love the living room  it 's huge and filled with sunshine  .  
 true  and i like the kitchen . it s new and well equipped  .  
 it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park  .  
 you are right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there  .  
 may be we could get some new furniture  better stuff  .  
this apartment is wonderful  .  
 i  m glad you like it  .  
 how much would i have to pay for rent  ?  
 the rent is  1050 each month  .  
 that  s way too much money  .  
 it isn  t too much  .  
 how about if i pay  850  ?  
 i can  t take that  .  
 i can  t go any higher than  850  .  
 i honestly don  t know what else to tell you  .  
 you can  t go any lower than that  ?  
do you like cooking  ?  
 i love it  .  i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking  ?  
 i don  t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal  .  i can  t stand doing the washing up  drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away  .  
 you can ask the guests for help  .  my guests usually insist on doing the washing up  .  i just have to remind them where everything goes  .  
 so what kinds of dishes do you usually make  ?  i know you like italian food  .  
 italian  indian and chinese  .  i  ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice  .  
 do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food  ?  
 not at all . you can find most of them in supermarkets . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference  not the ingredients  .  
 how long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people  ?  
i  d like to be fitted for a suit please  .  
 certainly  .  have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from  ?  we have a selection of materials over here  .  
 well  i thought that i would choose either this one or that one  .  i really want a dark blue suit  .  which do you recommend  .  
 this material is a little more expensive  but is of much higher quality  .  
 yes  .  i can feel the difference in material  .  there  s not much difference in price  .  ok  i  ll take the more expensive one  .  
 fine  .  i  ll measure you for the suit  .  .  .  shoulder  .  .  .  waist  .  .  .  inside leg  .  .  .  forearm  .  .  .  upper arm  .  .  .  thank you  .  i  ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow  .  could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su 
 that  s fine  .  i would also like a few shirts and a jacket  .  i don  t need them specially made  .  those shirts over there look very nice  .  are they made of cotton  ?  
 yes  they are  .  how many would you like and of which color  ?  
 i  ll take three light blue ones  please  .  
 are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal  ?  
 just a casual one  a sport jacket  .  this one looks nice  .  i  ll just try it on  .  .  .  yes  that  s fine  .  i  ll take it  .  here  s my credit card  .  
 thank you very much  sir  .  i  ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you  .  
may i speak to the apartment building manager  please  ?  
 i 'm the manager  .  how can i help you  ?  
 i was hoping that the apartment on main street was still available  .  
 why  yes  it is  .  would you like to get a look inside the apartment  ?  
 yes  it would be nice to see the apartment  .  
 how about today at 6 o 'clock  ?  
 yes  i can be there at 6  .  
 sounds good  .  i 'll see you at 6  .  do you want directions  ?  
 i 'm okay  thank you  .  i already checked out the address on mapquest  .  
 if you like the place  you can fill out an application form  .  i 'll bring one with me  .  
 is there anything that i need to bring with me  ?  
good morning  .  i  m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room  .  could you help me  ?  
 certainly  .  as you can see  we have several threepiece suites on sale  .  feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are  .  
 i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision  .  i think i like the black leather suite  .  it 's on sale  is n't it  .  
 yes  .  the price has been reduced by 50   .  it  s a real bargain  .  
 i  ll take it  .  i also need to improve the lighting in my living room  .  do you have any suggestions  ?  
 those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you  re reading or watching tv  .  how big is your living room  ?  
 it  s quite large  .  it  s about 40 square meters  .  
 i  d suggest you buy two  .  that allows you to change the brightness of the room better  .  
this house is not looking all that great from here 
 you can  t really tell everything about a house from the outside  .  let  s go inside  .  
 i don  t think that it is looking any better inside here  .  
 i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better  .  
 it is just too dark in here with so few windows  .  
 i hear that the kitchen is quite large  .  let  s go check it out  .  
 the kitchen may be large  but it doesn  t have any storage space  .  
 the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant  .  maybe it will be a little better  .  
 how many dogs live in this house  ?  
oh  i am not sure i even want to look at this house  !  
 it is a bit of a fixerupper  .  let  s take a look inside  .  
 it doesn  t look much better inside this place  .  
 you know  with a little elbow grease and paint  you could spruce it up a bit  .  
 there are hardly any windows in here  and that makes it really gloomy  .  
 let  s go check out the kitchen  .  the printout says that it is quite large  .  
 look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper  .  
 maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities  .  follow me  please  .  
 what  s that smell  ?  
hi  can i speak with the apartment manager  please  ?  
 hello  this is the apartment manager speaking  .  
 i 'm calling about the apartment for rent on main street  .  
 would you be interested in seeing the apartment  ?  
 i would love to see it  .  
 are you free today at around 6 p  .  m  .   ?  
 yes  i will be able to make it then  .  
 well  i 'll see you at 6 p  .  m  .  do you know how to get there  ?  
 i used to live in that area  .  
 i 'll give you an application form when i see you  .  
 that sounds good  .  do i need to bring anything  ?  
can i help you  ?  
 yes  i need to buy a computer for this semester  .  i was told it is cheaper to buy computers here  .  
 well  you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students  .  
 i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory  .  and i need a printer  .  
 well  first let 's consider your computer . here  for example  is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory  .  
 is that a lot  ?  sixtyfour  ?  
 yes  it is  .  it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in  ?  
 history  .  
 well  so you will mostly be using word processing  for writing papers  .  i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later  .  let 's talk about your 
 thirty percent  ?  
 yes  .  
 wow  .  that 's really good . and you think this is really a good system for a graduate student  ?  
 yes  .  it 's an excellent system  .  
 hmm  .  hey  wait  .  this has an apple on it  .  is this an apple computer  ?  
 yes  it 's a macintosh  .  it 's apple  .  macintosh and apple are the same thing  .  
 i do n't want macintosh  .  i want pc  .  
 i 'm sorry  but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment  .  
 what  ?  are you serious  ?  
 yes  .  
 but nobody uses macintosh  !  
 that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and wordprocessing  and that is what students mostly do  .  ma 
 yes  i 'm from taiwan  .  
 well  i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america  especially in universities and publishing companies  apple is very commonly used  .  
 but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese  .  
 there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple  .  
 hmm  .  i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision  .  i 'm sorry  .  
 no  do n't be sorry  .  it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me  most of the students here in the universityasian students includedmost of them use apple  .  
 well  thanks for your advice  .  i will probably come back later  .  
i need a haircut  .  
 do you have an appointment  ?  
 no  i do n't  .  you look pretty busy today  .  do you have an opening for me  ?  
 yes  we do  .  i can cut your hair right now if you like . do you need a shampoo too  or just a haircut  ?  
 just a haircut  .  i washed my hair this morning  .  
 alright  .  i will have an assistant wet your hair  .  then i can cut it . please step over there . how would you like your hair cut today  ?  
 well  i last had a haircut eight weeks ago  .  so my hair is pretty long . but i want the same style  .  
 i recommend you leave it a little long on top . but we should take in the back and sides a bit more  .  that 's more fashionable now  .  
 alright  .  you are the expert  .  i 'm happy to have your recommendation  .  
 so i will cut the sides just above the ear  .  is that good  ?  
 fine  .  
 and do you usually part your hair along here  ?  
 yes  .  
 alright  i know just what to do . your hair seems quite dry  you know  .  and i see some split ends  .  
 yes  i know my hair is quite thin . it runs in my family  .  everybody has very thin hair  .  
 the problem is the split ends  .  they make your hair look even more frizzy  .  
 i do n't know what to do about it  .  
 well  there are two things you can do . first  do n't blowdry your hair for so long after you shower  .  let it dry naturally . that is easier on the hair  so you wo n't get split ends . second  buy a g 
 do you sell conditioner here  ?  
 of course  .  i have one i can suggest  .  
 great  .  i would be happy to try it  .  i know my hair does n't look good now  .  it 's too weak  .  
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking  .  
 we should plan to move out of here before july  .  i 'm tired of living in apartments  .  
 i know  dear  .  i am too  .  but we 've just been too busy to look for a house  .  
 we need to find a good realtor  .  
 not necessarily  .  if we use a realtor to find a house  it will be more expensive  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something  we have to pay him  .  
 but does n't a realtor help with the contract  ?  i thought they take care of all the legal troubles  .  
 yes  that 's often true  .  but you have to pay them  .  
 i still think we should have a realtor . we re new in this country  .  we do n't know all the laws of buying a house . and also  the realtor will inspect the house . he can tell us if the house has 
 of course we need a home inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . and as for the legal problems  i have friends  .  they can help us  .  
 so how can we find a house if we do n't have a realtor  ?  
 it takes a little more time  .  we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them  .  
 and does n't the person selling the house have a realtor  ?  
 sometimes they do  sometimes they do n't  .  it 's best to find someone who is selling by themselves  .  
 why  ?  
 because if the seller has a realtor  their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor  .  
 hmm  .  it all sounds very complicated  .  
 it is  .  but buying a house is very important  .  so it takes time . that s why we have n't done it yet  .  it 's very troublesome  .  
 i want to look in the papers today  .  maybe we can see something we like  .  
are you good at cooking  ?  
 no  but i 'm pretty good at eating  !  
 do you prefer chinese food or western food  ?  
 well  to be honest with you  chinese food is really different from western food  .  
 are you used to the food here  ?  
 i 'm not really used to it yet  .  
 what 's your favorite chinese dish  ?  
 like most foreigners  i really like sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken  .  i eat them almost every day  .  
 have you tried traditional chinese dumplings yet  ?  
 i tried once  but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks  .  
 you know  foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently  .  if you do  you 'll give your chinese friends quite an impression  .  
 that 's good to know  .  i 'd like to try more chinese food  but since i ca n't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home  it 's difficult to try new food  .  
 if you want  i can introduce you to some typical chinese dishes  .  
 that would be great  .  i really only want to taste real chinese food  not just the food that foreigners like to eat  !  
albert and i need a lot of things to furnish our house . but i do n't know where the best place to shop is  .  can you give me some advice  ?  
 sure  carolyn  .  i 'm happy to help you . what kinds of things do you need right now  ?  
 well  we have most of the furniture already . we mostly need kitchen utensils  bathroom accessories  cleaning and laundry accessoriesthings like that . and albert wants to set up a little off 
 well  as for albert  he should go to an office supply store . there s a very good one called office depot  .  they have everything he will need . and their prices are good too  .  it 's very convey 
 can i write that down  ?  
 sure  it 's spelled office and then d  e  p  o  t . it s in the yellow pages  .  
 thanks  .  
 and as for the kitchen things  do you want very high quality  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i mean  do you want the best quality  or do you want good prices  ?  
 probably good prices  .  you know we will only be in america for about a year  .  
 then i suggest you go to kmart or walmart  .  
 what are those stores  ?  
 they are very large  discount department stores . that means their prices are very good . and you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom  .  
 even silverware  ?  
 yes  everything . they do n't have the most expensive brands  but their quality is usually decent . the main thing is  they have good prices  and they are very convenient  .  
 i have a friend that said something about a place called price club . do you know about that  ?  
 i have never shopped there  but i think price club is a kind of membership store  .  
 what does that mean  ?  
 that means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there  .  i have heard they have very good prices on electronics  .  
 electronics  ?  
 yes  .  like stereos and televisions  .  
 how much is the membership fee  ?  
 i 'm not sure . but if you are only going to stay a year  i do n't think price club is good to join . they have great deals occasionally . they are very good for people who like to buy new things all 
 i see  .  thanks for these tips  .  we really need to buy a lot of little things  .  
may i help you  ?  
 yes  i would like to return these slacks  .  
 alright  .  do you have your receipt  ?  
 yes  .  here it is  .  i bought them last week  .  
 and why are you returning them  ?  
 i bought them to go with a blouse of mine  .  but they do n't really match  .  
 i see  .  oh  wait  .  ma 'am  i 'm sorry  .  these slacks were on sale  .  
 yes  they were thirty percent off  .  
 i 'm sorry  but we do n't allow returns on sale items  .  
 i know many stores have that policy  .  but i have returned sale items here before  .  
 i 'm sorry  but we usually do n't do it  .  it is our policy  .  
 i just bought these slacks a week ago  .  and i am a regular customer here . can you make an exception this time  ?  
 well  .  let me talk to the manager for a moment . ma am  the manager says i can do it this time  .  
 good  .  i 'm a regular customer here  .  i am glad you can make an exception for me  .  
 please show me your receipt again  .  
 here it is  .  
 i will have to give you store credit  ma 'am  .  if you find something else you like in the store  you can use the credit  .  
 store credit is okay with me  .  i 'm sure i will find something i like  .  i shop here a lot  .  
morgan  can i ask you a question  ?  
 sure  what is it  ?  
 i was just wondering if many chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant  .  
 in most cities in china  doggie bags are quite uncommon  .  
 what happen to all the leftover food  ?  
 it usually goes to the dump  .  
 that seems like an awful waste  !  why do n't people order fewer dishes so that they do n't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal  ?  
 ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in china  .  you know  in the past  people could not afford to eat out like they can today  .  
 i guess that makes sense  .  i just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home  .  
 well  if you want  you can take the leftovers home  .  
 no  that 's ok  .  you know what they say when in rome  .  .  .  
 i was impressed that you tried the pig 's feet  .  i heard that many foreigners do n't like to eat them  .  
 many people in my generation do n't eat pig 's feet  but my parents grew up eating them  so i think they are ok  .  
 did you like them  ?  you could take the last one home with you  .  
do you like cooking  julia  ?  
 i really enjoy it  especially when it ends up tasting good  !  
 how often do you usually cook  ?  
 i usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and i make dinner about 6 times a week  .  
 that 's a lot of cooking  .  you must save a lot of money by eating at home so much  .  
 i do  .  if you cook at home  you can eat healthy food cheaply  .  
 what kind of dishes do you usually make  ?  
 i almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus  parsnips  peas  carrots and potatoes on sundays  .  
 do you make a lot of traditional british food  ?  
 aside from the sunday roast  we usually eat dangers and mash  toadinthehole  or fish 'n chips once a week  .  
 how about spicy food  ?  
 my family loves spicy food  .  we often eat chinese  thai  indian  or mexican food when we 're in the mood for spice  .  
 what 's your favorite dish to make  ?  
i 'm so tired  !  i do n't know how i 'm going to make it through this lecture  .  
 the professor is a bit boring today  .  you need something to perk yourself up  .  how about a coffee  ?  
 i do n't really like coffee  to be honest  .  it 's too bitter for me  .  
 well  you need something to wake you up  .  how about a soda  ?  
 most some drinks have too much sugar in them  .  
 the diet sodas do n't have any caffeic in them  which one would you like  ?  
 i like diet sprite  .  does that have any caffeine in it  ?  
 unfortunately  it does n't  .  how about some diet coke  ?  
 i do n't care for coke  .  i heard that coke was first used as a medicine and i do n't like medicine  .  what else has caffeine  ?  
 maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte  they taste much better than plain brewed coffee  .  
 maybe  .  how about a mochaccino  ?  are they any good  ?  
 you 'll love that  .  it 's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup  .  
 that 's perfect  !  would you like one  too  ?  my treat  .  
do you have any plans for dinner tonight  ?  
 no  i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something  .  how about you  ?  
 i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight  .  what do you think  ?  
 i 'm absolutely useless at cooking  !  
 i could teach you how to cook something healthy  .  frozen pizza are so bad for you  !  
 i know they are n't good for me  but they are cheap  convenient  and fairly tasty  .  
 i recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize  .  maybe we could try that  ?  
 yeah  why not  .  do you have all the ingredients  ?  
 i bought all the ingredients this morning  so let 's start  !  
 what do we do first  ?  
 first  you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces  .  
 ok  .  should i heat the wok  ?  
 yes  .  once it gets hot  put a little oil in it  add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes  .  
 what about the chicken  ?  
 that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through  .  
 how about the rice  ?  
 i 'll prepare it  .  do you prefer white rice or brown rice  ?  
are we going to have dinner tonight  ?

 i was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce  .  
 the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests  .  
 i am a vegetarian  .  do you have any vegetarian selections  ?  
 you could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad  .  
 i think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza  .  
 that is a good selection  and i can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree  .  
have you had enough time to look over the menu  ?  
 yes  we are almost ready to order  .  
 let me remind you of the specials of the day  which are posted on the board  .

 they 're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars  .  
 oh  i think i know what you 're talking about  .  
 can i help you with anything else  ?

 what problems did you find  ?  
 the roof leaks when it rains  there is mold on the bedroom walls  and the dishwasher doesn  t work  .  
 i don  t really consider any of that to be my responsibility  .  you can fix those things yourself  .  
 maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility  .  
 i am maintaining the building  .  you are way too picky  !  
 unfortunately  you won  t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by friday  .  
do you even know where this bus is supposed to go  ?  
 it should take us all the way up to altadena  .  
 do n't you know  ?  
 i 'm not positive if it does or not  .  
 is this the right bus  or not  ?  
 i have never been on this bus  but i 'm sure it 's the right one  .  
 where are we  ?  this is not altadena  .  
 i know  and we 've been on the bus forever  .  
 tell me what the street signs say  .  
 oh my gosh  that one says temple city  .  
 next time  i 'll look for the bus myself  .  
how do you like the apartment  ?  
 i like the apartment  but i see something wrong with it  .  
 what  s wrong  ?

 i won  t be able to do that right now  .  
 well  i won  t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed  .  
 fine  i  ll have it fixed for you  .  
you really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment  .  
 that apartment never had any problems before  .  are you sure the problem isn  t you  ?  
 we spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix  .  
 where do you think you have problems  ?  
 there is no hot water  the bedroom has a broken window  and there are rats in the kitchen  .  
 you know  no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before  .  
 you are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment  .  
 i will fix these problems when i get around to it  .  
 i will be withholding my rent check this friday unless these problems are addressed immediately  .  
are you sure you know where this bus goes  ?  
 it should go to altadena  .  
 what do you mean it should  ?  
 i 'm not completely sure if it really does  .  
 dude  are we on the right bus  ?  
 i 'm almost positive that this is the right one  .  
 it does n't look like we 're on our way to altadena  .  
 we have been riding this bus for a long time  .  
 what does that sign say  ?  
 i think it says temple city  .  
 yup  i 'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  but at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started  .  
hey  how 's it going  ?  
 good  .  how about you  ?  
 not bad  thanks for asking  .  
 have you been on the bus for a while  ?  
 only about fifteen minutes  .  
 do you ride this bus often  ?  
 not really  i usually drive  .  
 you have a car  ?  
 yes  i do  .  
 so why are n't you driving it  ?  
 once our president lowers gas prices  i 'll be driving again  .  
where do we get off at  ?  
 i think we have a little ways to go  .  
 this bus ride is taking forever  .  
 i know  .  
 did we miss our stop  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 did n't you say you knew where to get off the bus  ?  
 i do n't know  .  we may have missed our stop  .

 i ca n't catch the bus with you anymore  .  
hi  ann  .  
 hi  .  you look excited  .  what 's happening  ?  
 i just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days  .  
 and you 're planning to enter  ?  
 of course  .  this is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice  .  
 is there a prize  ?  
 i heard that the winner gets a panda radio  .  
 do you think you have a chance  ?  
 a chance  ?  not just a chance  i 'm a hundred percent certain . everyone says my voice is beautiful  .  
 but you have n't practised all that much  .  
 i still have 5 days to practise  .  it 's in the bag  !  
 do n't be too sure  .  you 're still going to need some help  .  
hi  li ming  .  you look upset  .  what 's the matter  ?  
 there will be a parents meeting in our class this saturday and i am worried about it  .  
 why  ?  we can leave school earlier that day  .  
 i did n't do well in last exams  .  if my father knows it  he will beat me up  .  
 i ca n't believe it  .  my parents never beat me  .  
 you know that my father is irritable  .  
 you can ask the teacher for help  .  
excuse me  ?  i did n't hear what you said  .  
 i asked you if you wanted some help  .  
 i am new to this school and not familiar with this library  .  can you help me  ?  
 certainly  .  what 's your topic  ?  
 i 'm looking for information on tropical fish  .  
 all right  .  you can use the computer over there  enter tropical fish 'under subject  .  if you know the title of the book  enter it under title 
 great  thank you  .  
hi  tony  .  you look unhappy  .  what 's wrong  ?  
 oh  steven  i made a big mistake  .  
 what happened  ?  
 i really wish i hadn  t done it  .  
 what on earth are you talking about  ?  
 i got caught cheating  .  i feel so ashamed  .  the teacher saw me and told me i failed  .  
 what were you thinking  ?  
 you know my father  .  if i fail  he 'll kill me  .  i have to do well  .  
 but what you should do is study hard  .  
 i know  .  .  .  i know  .  .  .  it 's all my fault  .  i feel awful that i didn  t study  and i cheated  and i got caught  .  
are you still on your summer vacation  ?  
 yes  .  
 when will school start  ?  
what subject do you like best  ?  
 english is my favorite  .  
 no wonder your english is so good  .  
how do you usually get to school  ?  
 i usually ride my bike  .  which form of transport do you prefer to use  ?  
 i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle  but when i feel lazy  i drive my car  .  
 i think we should discourage people from using their private cars  .  they produce too much pollution  !  
 i agree  but i would find it difficult to stop using my car  .  it 's just so convenient  .  
 cars might be convenient  but they 're so bad for the environment  .  
 do you have a car  ?  
 no  .  i used to have one though  .  once i started using my bicycle to get around  i found that i did n't really need it  .  
 maybe if i sold my car now  i would n't be so tempted to use it  .  
 you could try  .  it would save you a lot of money  .  
 that 's true  .  every month  i spend hundreds of dollars on gas  insurance  and repairs  .  
 if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving  you will get lots of exercise  too  !  
 i could stand to lose a few pounds  .  having a car has made me lazy  .  i never end up walking anywhere  !  
 let 's go to a car dealership  .  i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price  .  
oh  linda  .  you must be so excited about going to study in america  .  
 oh yes i am  .  i have always wanted to go to the states  .  i love meeting new people and making new friends  .  
 well  i am sure you will  .  
 well  there is one thing  .  
 what is the matter  ?  
 i am a little worried about my host family  .  you know  in the agreement  i have to do some cooking for them  .  
 yes  ?  
 well  i am just afraid they wo n't like my chinese way of cooking  .  
 oh  listen  you 'll soon learn  and i am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared  .  
hi  !  how are you doing  ?  
 good  thanks  .  how about you  ?  
 pretty good  .  say  where are you living this semester  ?  
 in no  .  4 dorm  .  i like dorm life  .  you will meet a lot of people and you do n't have to cook  .  what about you  ?  
 oh  i am looking for an apartment  .  i prefer living off campus  .  i can study better  .  
 i hope you will find a place  .  listen  i 'd better go  .  i am going to be late for class  .  
 okay  see you around  .  
mary  there 's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave  .  
 what is it  ?  
 you have to take the math and english evaluation tests  .  
 why  ?  
 because you 're from a foreign country  .  the school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills  .  
 it 's so that i can be put into the right math and english classes  right  ?  
 you are a smart girl  !  
i am sorry to trouble you again  mr . stone  .  
 it 's ok  .  what do you want to ask  ?  
 where should i go after i arrived at the university  ?  
 the first place you should go is the international center  .  
 why  ?  
 you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service  you can find foreign student advisers  .  
 what kind of role do foreign student advisers play  ?  
 they 'll discuss personal concerns  housing  adjustment  finances and other matters with you  .  
 can we get any more help at the international center  ?  
 yes  a lot more  .  if you go there just before the beginning of the fall 's semester  you can get your student id and social security number there  .  they will keep your documents uptodate  .  they will offer an orientation program for new comers  .  they will also help you contact your department and registration office  .  
 i see  .  it must be worth going to  .  
 besides these  the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours  home hospitality  speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students  .  in cooperation with nationality clubs  student associations and other organizations  the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year  .  
 wonderful  .  it is a home for foreign students  .  
what are you going to do for one year abroad  tom  ?  
 study  study  study  .  i want to learn a lot  .  
 you are going to take courses  ?  
 yes  .  i am going to take some university courses there  .  
 sounds hard  .  
 yes  but i think it 's probably for the best  .  
 wo n't you get lonely  ?  
what do you think of your teacher  ?  
 he 's very strict with us  .  
 and i hear he gives very good lectures  .  
could you tell me how to use the library  ?  
 sure  .  all you need is your student id card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library  .  
 how many books am i allowed to check out at a time  ?  
 two books at a time  .  except magazines or journals  they have to be read within library  .  
 how long can i keep the books  ?  
 for one month  .  if you can  t return the books in time  you 'll be fined  .  but if you renew them  you can keep them longer  .  
 i see  .  now i want to check out two books on spoken english  .  can you show me where i can find them  ?  
 yes  just over there to your right  .  
 thank you very much  .  
hi  .  what 's your name  ?  
 my name is jung min  .  what 's your name  ?  
 my name is jessica  .  it 's nice to meet you  .  
 yes  .  it 's nice to meet you too  .  are you a new student too  ?  
 no  .  i 'm a sophomore  .  i take it you are a new student  ?  
 yeah  .  it 's pretty exciting to be here  .  
 have fun while it lasts  .  the excitement wears off real quick  .  especially after you see how much homework you get  .  where are you from  ?  
 i 'm from korea  .  my parents wanted me to go to an american university  so i came here  .  
 i have never been to korea  .  i 've been to japan before  but never korea  .  
 why were you in japan  ?  
 my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country  .  he 's so into learning about different cultures  .  
 that 's pretty cool  .  
 i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents  .  
 well  if you ever want to visit korea  i would be happy to show you around  .  
 thanks for the offer  .  i 'll keep that in mind  .  oh  the professor is coming  .  we 'll talk more after class  .  
hey john  did you register for classes yet  ?  
 i register this friday  .  
 what classes do you plan on taking  ?  
 i really want to take the communication class  but i do n't know if it will be available  .  
 is that class really that popular  ?  
 yeah  .  i tried to get in last semester  but it was full by the time i registered  .  
 what other classes are you going to take  ?  
 i still need to take english 201  but i really do n't like writing  .  
 i took that class already  .  there is a lot of writing  but it 's not that bad  .  
 oh really  ?  who was the instructor  ?  there are like 4 different instructors to choose from  .  
 i had professor mahoney  .  
 is he an easy grader  ?  
 i 'm not sure if he is or not  but i thought he was definitely fair  .  
 do you mind if i ask you what you got  ?  
 not at all  .  i got a 3 . 8  .  
 well  what did you get in english 101 last year  ?  
 i got a 4 . 0 in that class  .  
 well  i ca n't compare to you  .  i got a 3 . 1 in english 101  .  that means if you got a lower grade in english 201  it must be harder  .  
 it 's not what it appears  .  i actually tried harder in the 101 class  .  if i put as much effort into the 201 class  i would have received the same grade  .  
did you get your grades yet  ?  
 yeah  .  my whole gpa is screwed up now  .  
 why  ?  what happened  ?  
 well  i bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1 . 7  .  
 ouch  .  you must be very disappointed  .  
 well  it 's my fault because i did n't study as much as i should have  .  
 why do n't you retake the class next year  ?  
 that 's what i plan on doing unless i keep screwing up  .  how did you do this semester  ?  
 i did n't do that well either  .  i ended up with a 3 . 2 this semester  .  that drops my total gpa to 3 . 45  .  
 my gpa is pretty similar to yours  .  i have a 3 . 1 now because of the stupid econ class  .  
 what was your gpa before this semester  ?  
 i was sitting happy with a 3 . 4  .  
 why did it go down so much  ?  
 let 's just say i screwed up more than my econ class  .  
 what happened to you  ?  
 i started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time  .  
 you better stop slacking off  .  
hi mark  .  
 oh  hi stacy  .  
 how was your summer vacation  ?  
 i worked over the summer at a restaurant  .  have to make tuition money  right  ?  what did you do  ?  
 i took summer school  .  i withdrew from two of my classes last year so i wanted to make them up  .  
 so are you officially a junior now  ?  
 yeah  .  and i have 5 credits to spare  .  i only needed to take 10 credits over the summer  but i took 15 because the price was the same  .  
 that makes sense  .  so where is nicole  ?  
 she dropped out of school completely  .  
 really  ?  why  ?  
 she worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well  they asked her if she wanted to work full time  .  
 wow  .  she 's so lucky  .  she does n't have a degree and she already has a job  .  
 it sounds good now  but i 'm traditional  .  i want the degree  so i would n't have accepted the offer  .  
 do you know how much they are paying her  ?  
hey mike  .  i forgot about registration  .  i 'm a day late  so all the classes are mostly full  .  what do you think i should do  ?  
 you 're screwed  .  you ca n't do anything about that  .  you have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful  .  
 do you think going to the registration building will help at all  ?  
 no  .  they will tell you the same thing in a worse way  .  
 did you register yet  ?  
 of course  .  registering for classes is not something you want to miss  .  
 what classes do you think are still open  ?  
 well  i know psychology 101 is a big class  so there will always be seats in that class  .  you can also get into sociology  .  
 that 's helpful  .  thanks  .  but what do you think about philosophy  .  i wanted to take that class this semester  .  
 i took that class last year  .  the professor is really cool  so if you go to his office  you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full  .  
 he does that  ?  
 i guess that 's because so many people drop out of that class  .  
 that makes sense  .  i think i 'll do that  .  thanks for all the help  .  
did you already take the history exam  ?  
 yeah  .  it was hard  .  when do you take it  ?  
 i take it tomorrow morning  .  there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on  .  what types of questions did you get  ?  
 mostly on the civil war  .  you should also study the impact martin luther king jr  .  had on american society  .  
 what about abraham lincoln  ?  did you get any questions about him  ?  
 i only had 1 question about him  .  but you might get more  .  i dont know if he will have the same exam or not  .  
 hopefully he will use the same exam  cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war  .  it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class  .  
 if you cant study everything  then that is probably the best way to go  .  
 aright  .  thanks for the info  .  i gotta go to the library now  .  
 good luck  .  
what are you going to do for one year abroad  tom  ?  
 study  study  study  .  i want to learn a lot  .  
 you are going to take courses  ?  
 yes  .  i am going to take some university courses there  .  
 sounds hard  .  
 yes  but i think it 's probably for the best  .  
 won  t you get lonely  ?  
can i help you  sir  ?  
 yes  i 'd like a book about law  .  
 would you tell me the name of the book and the author  ?  
 uh  the origin of law  .  and it 's written by professor felix of harvard  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  it 's out of stock now  .  could you come by again next week  ?  
 next week  ?  it is too late  .  i need it urgently  .  
 well  then  is it convenient to leave your phone number so that i can inform you as soon as we restock it  ?  
 no  thanks any way  .  
hey  jordan  is that you  ?  long time no see  !  
 oh  hey  no kidding  !  i have n't seen you since orientation three months ago  !  so how 've you been  ?  settling into college life ok  ?  
 yeah  i think so  !  i pledged phi iota alpha  so i 'm living at the frat house now  .  
 oh  so you 're a frat boy now  huh  ?  
 yeah  yeah  i know  it 's totally cliche  but really  i think it 's been a good decision  .  i 've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys  .  what about you  ?  what have you been up to  ?  
 not much  .  i 'm still living at home and commuting to school  .  i ended up dropping that metalworking class i was so excited about  .  it just was n't as interesting as i 'd hoped  .  the guidance counselor suggested that i focus on my prerequisite courses so that i can make sure the credits count  .  
 that sounds smart  .  .  .  but kind of boring  .  
 yeah  it is  a little bit  .  i joined the great outdoors club  though  which has been a lot of fun  .  we 've gone on two camping trips already  and i 've made some good friends  .  
 that 's cool  .  hey  so have you decided on your major yet  ?  
 definitely premed  .  what about you  ?  
 i still have no clue  .  .  .  but we do n't have to declare a major till our sophomore year  so i 've got time  !  oops  i 'm late for class  .  gotta run  !  
 ok  take care  !  hey  nice running into you  !  
i 'm afraid i ca n't complete my paper on time  .  
 what happened  ?  
 i keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment  .  i can hardly go on  .  
wow  !  look at all these books  !  i bet i can find a book about anything here  !  
 shih  !   !  please keep your voice down  .  there are people reading and studying here  .  
 ok  i 'm sorry  .  are you the librarian  ?  maybe you can help me  i am looking for a book  .  
 yes i am  .  you can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre  title or if you know the author  i can point you towards the right direction  .  
 i am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes  .  
 that would be in our children's section  .  that book shelf there on the right  .  
 ok  i would like to check out these books  .  
 do you have a library card  ?  
 no  .  how do i get one  ?  
 i just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state  .  
 here you go  .  
 so you are all set  .  you can have these books for two weeks  .  if you need to have them longer  you can bring them here to renew them  .  if you do n't  you get charged ten cents a day for each book  .  
hey  wen  !  welcome to d  .  c  .   !  glad you came out to visit  !  
 thanks for inviting me  .  actually  i 've never been anywhere with so many black people before  .  it 's different  .  
 howard is eighty percent black  .  but there are whites  and even asians here  .  thankfully  it 's also coed  .  
 great  !  is your  too  ?  
 sorry  nope  .  but the alpha phi alpha 's are throwing a party tonight  .  
excuse me  ?  is this where i register  ?  i  d like to sign up for my courses for next semester  .  
 yes  of course  .  i need your student id please  .  
 here you are  .  
 okay  susan  .  it says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year  .  is this information correct  ?  
 yes  .  i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology  .  
 sure  .  that  s not a problem  .  do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester  ?  
 yeah  .  here  s my list  .  i  m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though  .  
 yeah  that  s perfect  .  what about the subjects for your minor  ?  
 oh yeah  !  almost forgot  !  i need to take fundamental linguistics  consumer psychology and neuroanatomy  .  
how should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university  ?  we have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events  .  
 we should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students  .  we could have a firework display  .  
 do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors  ?  
 if we do  too many people might attend  .  perhaps we should invited all of them  but make a small charge to attend  .  
 good idea  .  we should also hold a series of presentations  .  we could have presentations on the history of the university  the courses we offer  and our links with other universities  .  
 good idea  !  i think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives  .  
 we could have another on the successes of graduates from here  .  
 i think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenaryyou know  tshirts  mugs  plates  pens  and things like that  .  
 that  s an excellent idea  .  hopefully  we would be able to make a profit  !  a few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university  .  
 i  m looking forward to reading that  .  we could have book signings by famous professors an alumni  .  
 a group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film  .  
hey eve  how are you  ?  
 i  m fine  celia  .  and you  ?  
 i  m ok  .  i  m so busy  !  
 do you have a lot of homework  ?  
 yes  .  don  t you  ?  
 of course i do  !  
 which class are you working on right now  ?  
 i  m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow  .  
 are you in mrs green  s class  ?  
 yes  .  are you  ?  
 yes  .  we must have the same exam tomorrow  !  
 do you want to study together  ?  
 sure  .  this library is too quiet though  .  
 do you want to go to and empty classroom  ?  
 that sounds good  .  
do you speak only english in the class  or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish  ?  
 oh  we never speak spanish in class  !  miss . parker speaks to us only in english  .  
 i suppose she 's right  .  does she speak english very slowly  ?  
 not always  .  sometimes we do n't understand her  .  then she has to repeat what she said  .  
 it must be interesting to study english  .  
 mario and i are the best students in the class  .  miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good  .  
 is english pronunciation easy or difficult  ?  
our maths teacher is rather humorous  .  
 on the contrary  i think he 's very serious  .  
 no  not at all . his examples are really interesting  .  
 so they 're easy to remember  .  
 yeah  how about your maths teacher  ?  
 he 's an old antique  very serious  .  
 bad luck  anne  .  
 hey  !  how about your history teacher  ?  
 she 's another antique  .  
what do you think of your teacher  ?  
 he 's very strict with us  .  
 and i hear he gives very good lectures  .  
excuse me . where do i register  ?  
 oh  over there in pacific pavilion  .  
 is that the large  white building  ?  
 yeah  that 's it  .  
hi  lilly  it  s so nice to see you again  .  
 hum  me too  .  this winter holiday was especially long  .  what have you done  ?  
 nothing special  .  i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school  visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for  .  how about yours  ?  
what 's the matter  ?  you do n't look well  .  
 i am worried  .  
 what about  ?  
 my exam  .  
 oh  is that all  ?  
 i feel very nervous about it  .  
what do you hope to do when you finish university  ?  
 i  d like to go into management  .  i  ve applied for several jobs already and i  m hopeful that i  ll get some job offers  .  how about you  ?  
 after i graduate  i have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer  .  i think i  ve got a good chance of passing  .  there  s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in london  provide 
 we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions  .  
 if life were easy  then we  d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored  .  
 unfortunately  it  s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed  .  
 that  s why ambition need to be realistic  .  you can  t achieve something that  s totally unrealistic  .  
 as long as you plan carefully  most thing are possible  .  it  s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong  .  
 i think it  s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in  not something that other people force you to be interested it  .  
 my father wanted me to become a doctor  but i knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field  .  
how are you doing today  ?  
 good  .  thanks for asking  .  
 what may i do for you  ?  
 i need help with something  .  
 what do you need help with  ?  
 i am looking for a newspaper article  .  
 have you looked in the periodicals  ?  
 i didn  t even think about that  .  
 i can show you where they are  .  
 that would be a lot of help  .  
 follow me  please  .  
that looks like an interesting book  .  
 it is  .  it  s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world  with brief descriptions of how they were build  their purpose  and so on  .  
 there are the pyramids  .  it  s easy to see how they got that name  !  they don  t have smooth sides though  .  
 they don  t now  but most of them did originally  .  there  s picture of the pentagon in the united states  .  it  s very distinctive with its five sides  .  
 look at that cylindrical office building  .  i  ve never been seen one that shape before  .  
 yes  .  usually only tv towers are cylindrical in shape  .  
 tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top  .  they  re not perfectly cylindrical  .  
 this is the world  s largest sports stadium  .  it  s a massive oval  .  
 what sports do they play there  ?  
 it says here that it  s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings  .  
 is that building a perfect cube  ?  
 according to the book  it is  .  i  ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube  .  look at the building  .  from the air  it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides  .  what 
what book is that  ?  
 i just bought a new atlas  .  i  m looking this map of the world  .  look at russia  !  that  s a vast country  .  
 canada  china  and the use are huge too  .  
 there are several tiny countries in the world too  .  countries like monaco are smaller than many cities  .  
 those small countries are microscopic compared to russia  .  european countries are relatively small  .  france looks quite big in europe  but compared to many countries in other continents  it  s not very l 
 britain is half the size of france  but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world  .  
what can i do for you  ?  
 i want to check out these books  .  
 i need your library card  .  
 i have it right here  .  
 it seems you have late fees  .  
 are you sure  ?  
 yes  i  m sure  .  
 how much  ?  
 your late fees come to  24 . 50  .  
 i don  t have that right now  .  
 you have to pay it off before you can check out more books  .  
i 'm here for my appointment  .  
 what can i do for you today  ?  
 i have an issue with my schedule  .  
 tell me the problem  .  
 i have two classes on here that are at the same time  .  
 oh  i see  .  
 can you change that for me  ?  
 do you still want both classes  ?  
 yes  i would like to keep both classes  .  
 i 'll try to change one to a different day  .  
professor  do you have a few moments when i could meet with you  ?  
 i schedule my appointments from two to four on saturday  what works best for you  ?  
 three would be a good time  .  
 great  do you need directions to my office  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 well  just make sure to go through the double doors  and i 'll be on the right  .  
 ok  i 'll find it  .  
 it 's very easy to find  .  
 see you then  .  
i was supposed to meet with you at half past one  .  
 yes  i see  .  what did you need to see me about  ?  
 there 's a problem with my schedule  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 two of my classes occur at the same time  .  
 well  i can see that 's a problem  .  
 is it at all possible for you to fix that error  ?  
 yes  i can  .  would you still like to have both of these classes  ?  
 i want to keep both of them  if that 's possible  .  
 well  let me find you one of these classes on a different day  .  
excuse me  professor  .  i think there might be an error in my test score  .  
 sure  .  do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right  ?  
 i think that the percentage is incorrect  .  
 let 's just go over all of it to doublecheck  .  
 sure  let 's do it  .  
 here is the answer sheet  .  do you see a place where i marked something wrong that should have been right  ?  
 i do n't see any mistakes  .  
 ok  now that we 've gotten those straightened out  let 's total the score  .  
 yes  let 's total it  .  
 well  if i total that like this and divide by this number  i get this total  .  do you agree  ?  
 yes  you 're right  .  
i was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher  .  
 is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked  ?  
 i think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right  .  
 these things can happen  let 's doublecheck the answers first to be sure  all right  ?  
 that would be great  !  
 look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers  .  do you see any place where i made a mistake in grading  ?  
 this one right here should be right  .  
 yeah  i see the same thing  now we can do the math and check that  right  ?  
 yeah  let 's do the math  .  
 i count all of the correct answers  total them  and divide by the total  .  does this look right to you  ?  
 looks pretty good  .  
could we go over some things  because i think my test score is wrong  .  
 what do you think is wrong  the math or the way your answer was scored  ?  
 both  .  
 i am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes  too  .  will that work for you  ?  
 yeah  i 'm ready  .  
 check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake  .  
 these look strange  .  
 yes  i agree  let 's move on to the calculating of the score  .  would that be ok  ?  
 ok  let 's do the calculation  .  
 we add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage  .  
 i see  .  
i was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades  .  
 grades are based on many things 
 what counts the most  ?  
 actually i look at all of it and let 's not forget class participation  .  
 do you grade on a curve or use percentages  ?  
 homework  attendance  and quizzes are sixty percent  the midterm and final are worth twenty percent each  .  
 what if we miss something  ?  
 i will allow one unexcused absence  after that you need to contact me ahead of time  .  
 will you tell us if we are failing during the year  ?  
what do you base our grades on  ?  
 all of your coursework is important  including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester  .  
 does the final count the most  ?  
 all of it is important  please just do your best at all times  .  
 how do you total our scores  ?  
 the final and midterm are twenty percent each  homework  attendance  and quizzes are the rest  .  
 what if we are out sick  ?  
 make sure you contact me as i only allow one unexcused absence  .  
 how can we know if we are doing ok during the year  ?  
i 'd like to talk to you about my grades  .  
 sure  !  what exactly do you have questions about  ?  
 i am worried that i messed up on a test  .  
 well  let me take a look at my grade book  .  how do you think you are doing  ?  
 i think i am doing great  except for that one test  !  
 well  your scores show that you could do a little better  .  what do you think you could improve on  ?  
 i think that i could study a little harder for tests  .  
 fine  !  please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin  .  
 yes  i know  .  
what can i help you with today  ?  
 i need to check out this book  .  
 do you have your library card  ?  
 i don  t have one  .  
 would you like to apply for one right now  ?  
 that  s fine  .  
 i  m going to need you to fill out the application  .  
 all right  .  all done  .  
 all right  now please sign the back of the card  .  
 okay  .  i  ve signed it  .  
 that  s all there is to it  .  
you did n't ring me last night  .  you said you would  .  
 i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed  .  
 that 's all right  .  but why were you so rude to me at lunch  .  
 was i  ?  sorry  i didn  t mean to be  .  i do apologize  .  
 and why are you yarning now  ?  are you bored  ?  
i hear little bob has recovered  .  
 that 's a great relief  .  i was worried about him  .  
 the operation was very successful  .  
the answer is zero  !  what a letdown  !  
 i really want to take him over my knee  .  
 no hard feelings  .  after all  he is a child  .  
i like the design of the coat  .  
 but i like its color  .  
 anyway  it 's my ideal coat  .  i 'll take it  .  
i prefer potatoes to eggplants  .  
 i feel eggplants are more nutritious  .  
 but as a matter of fact  potatoes taste better  .  
on balance  dress designing appeals to me most  .  
 yes  it 's to my liking  too  .  
 say  how would you like to be a dress designer  ?  
i 've had enough of that  !  
 why  this is the most interesting film  !  
 i hate the hero . he s too cruel  .  
i am tired of everything in my life  .  
 what  ?  how happy you life is  !  i do envy you  .  
 you don  t know that i have been overprotected by my mother these years  .  i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings  .  
has the train come yet  ?  
 no  i  ve been waiting for ages  .  
 it  s so unreliable  .  i  ve been late for my meetings all this week  .  
 yes  me too  .  i think i  ve lost some important clients recently because of this train  !  
 yes  my customers have started to complain too  !  
i seldom heard the quarreling of her children  .  
 why do you say that  ?  
 because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long  .  
 oh  i see  .  she told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters  but not to pour oil on the flame  .  
why did n't you tell me you had a girlfriend  ?  
 sorry  i thought you knew  .  
 but you should tell me you were in love with her  .  
 did n't i  ?  
 you know you did n't  .  
 well  i am telling you now  .  
 yes  but you might have told me before  .  
 i did n't think you would be interested  .  
 you ca n't be serious  .  how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her  ?  
 sorry  i did n't think it mattered  .  
tom  i won first prize in the poetry contest  .  
 come on  !  you 're pulling my leg  .

 i accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke  .  i 'm really sorry  .  
are you listening to me  dan  ?  
 i 'm with you  jane  .  
 what did i just say  ?  
 well  uh  .  .  .  i did n't catch the last part  .

i 'm really sorry  bob  .  i accidentally damaged your bike  .  
 uhoh  .  it 'll probably cost a lot to fix it  .  
that 's a very nice pair of glasses  .  
 does it really look ok  ?  
 yes  and i like the color too  .  it matches your eyes  .  
 and i got it on sale  .  
you seemed to be fed up with mary  .  
 yeah  .  i get sick of her  .  she always bends my ear about what she thinks  .  
 she is a barking dog  .  but she means well  .  
 but i don  t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do  .  
you look like being on cloud nine  .  
 i am  .  
 what has made you so happy  ?  
 i think i 'm in love  .  
 are you  ?  who 's the lucky girl  ?  
 her name is jenny  .  
 how did you meet her  ?  
 we are in the same math class  .  our teacher sat us next to each other  .  
 what do you like best about her  ?  
 she 's very funny  .  she makes me laugh all the time  .  
 i guess it was fate working to bring you together  .  
i dislike susan  .  she is always above herself  .  
 don  t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office  ?  
 what of it  ?  
hello  .  i was wondering if taylor smith has checked out yet  ?  
 just one moment  .  i 'll check with the cancer ward desk  .  
 the cancer ward  !   ?  oh  my  .  it 's worse than we thought  .  
 ma 'am  i 'm sorry  .  the cancer ward said mr  .  smith passed away two days ago  .  
 that 's impossible  !  i 'm talking about mister taylor smith  .  
 yes  ma 'am  .  he died from complications of stomach cancer  .  i 'm very sorry  .  
it seems so strange to be here  burying you  but it 's not you  .  
 ashes to ashes and dust to dust  .  .  .  
 this has been the worst and best day of my life  taylor  .  they kept you in the hospital  and  .  .  .  
 i 'll tell you all about it another day  .  
 but you 're ok  ?  it was nothing serious  was it  ?  
you know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled  right  ?  
 why am i always the last to know these things  ?  
 i sent out a notice  .  you 've stopped checking your email  ?  
 no  but bean did send me like a hundred forwards today  .  my mailbox must have been overflowing  .  
 how obnoxious  !  i heard he was sending you dirty jokes  .  
you know  taylor 's been in the hospital for a couple of days  .  
 and i 'm the one who put him there with my football moves  .  
 but you 're not to blame for them keeping him there  .  
 yeah  what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway  ?  
 i 'm not sure  but we can find out  .  i bought some crosswords to keep him busy  .  
sorry  !  excuse me  !  i got your message  .  
 taylor  ?  taylor  !  is this a joke  ?  is it really you  ?  but  .  .  .  but  .  .  .  everyone said you were dead  !  
 that 's ok  .  just let it out  .  i 'm ok  !  i was out of town with  .  .  .  femi  .  
 oh  taylor  !  i 'm so  .  .  .  so happy  .  but then  .  .  .  who 's that  ?  
i do n't know what to say  .  this ca n't be happening  .  here 's the obituary  .  
 it 's really there  ?  this all seems so surreallike it 's all one big nightmare  .  
 but it explains why taylor is n't answering and femi took time off from work  .  
 poor femi  .  taylor 's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him  .  
 this says the viewing is at myers funeral home today until five  .  
did everyone fill out their entry permits  ?  
 yes  .  the videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak english with the flight attendants  .  
 speaking of flight attendants  they keep smiling at me  .  i wonder why  .  .  .  
 it 'll be the year 2000  !  the flight attendants are coming over here  .  they 're carrying bottles of champagne  !  
 that 's because it 's time  .  
 time for what  ?  
 it 's time to make our wedding wish come true  .  .  .  
 you mean get married now  ?  on the plane  ?  
 why not  ?  i 've got the rings ready  .  
 i do n't know what to say  jack  !  
are you ready to go to the mall  ?  
 yeah  .  dig my new pants  ?  
 copycat  !  
 what do you mean  ?  
 you went out and bought khakis  too  !  
 no  .  mine are a soft brown  .  yours are khaki  .  
brooke  are you still mad  ?  is your mom mad  ?  
 no  .  .  .  mom said that we 'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd  .  so let 's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day  .  .  .  
 it will be  .  and today is  too  .  i just talked to the airlines  .  .  .  
 they 're going to give us back the seats  ?  
 no  they 're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in  .  .  .  
 hawaii  ?  my dream honeymoon destination  ?  
 you got it  !  we 'll fly there directly from texas  .  
whew  !  i had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line  .  
 you have much patience  .  
 wow  !  your calligraphy is very beautiful  .  it was worth the wait  !  
 thank you  .  today i 'm writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet  .  
 what does it say  ?  
 this is an especially famous one  .  it says  may the passing days bring you health and longevity  .  may this season of renewal find you basked in riches  .   
 that 's very nice  .  is it for sale  ?  
 no  .  i never sell my artwork  .  
 really  ?  then what do you do with it  ?  
 i give it away  .  here  this one is for you  .  
 wow  !  really  ?  are you sure  ?  now i 'll have a lucky year  !  
shall i get you another cup of coffee  ?  
 yes  please  .  that is very kind of you  .  
 shall i make more sandwiches  ?  
good morning  loans  .  
 good morning  mr  .  smith  .  
 i would like to compliment you on your diligence  .  
 well  thank you  mr  .  smith  .  but i was just doing my job  .  
 yes  .  and we 're proud of you  loans  .  
listen to this  .  mary got married  .  
 is she really  ?  i can  t believe it  !  
 yes  .  yesterday  .  
 good gracious  .  that  s incredible  !  
 she married jerrod  .  
 you  re kidding  .  
 she  s going to live in paris  .  
my goodness  !  you  re kidding  !  
 no  .  i  m serious  .  i  m going to quit my job  .  
 that  s amazing  !  you got a good pay here  didn  t you  ?  
 it  s true  .  but i can  t show my abilities  .  
 come on  !  don  t be silly  !  
 your present job is something better  .  why do you change  ?  
i just had a terrible week  .  
 what a shame  !  
 i fell down and hurt my arm  .  
 that 's too bad  .  
 then my son drove into a tree  .  
 i 'm sorry to hear that  .  
 the dog bit the delivery boy  .  
 what a pity  !  
 and a storm blew our roof away  .  
maybe we 'd better go now  .  
 it 's still early  .  
 gosh  it 's already 10 . stay here if you like  .  
 since we 're late  let 's go to see a film  .  
what a charming room  !  it faces south  and there 's such a lovely view of the city  .  
 i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble  .  
 no  i should n't think so . by the way  is there a socket for my razor  ?  
 i think so . here it is . it s by the basin  .  
 is it a twopin socket  ?  
 yes  it is  .  
mr . ben  what do you think of the book  ?  
 it 's an excellent one  .  i like it very much  .  
 why  ?  
 it includes a lot of useful words and phrases  .  
my friend jane is very beautiful  .  
 what 's her figure  ?  
 perfect  .  and i like her charming eyes  too  .  
 what 's the color of her eyes  ?  
 dark blue  .  
 how old is she  ?  
say  jim  how about going for a few beers after dinner  ?  
 you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness  .  
 what do you mean  ?  it will help us to relax  .  
 do you really think so  ?  i do n't  .  it will just make us fat and act silly  .  remember last time  ?  
 i guess you are right . but what shall we do  ?  i do n't feel like sitting at home  .  
 i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  i hear mary and sally often go there to play pingpong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them  .  
 sounds great to me  !  if they are willing  we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun  too  .  
 good . let s go now  .  
i wish i knew who had moved our flower pots  .  
 it was me  .  i am so sorry  .  
 what did you think you were doing  ?  
 i had to move it  so that i can get my bike through  .  
 how dare you be so inconsiderate  ?  that 's wrong  .  
 i am awfully sorry  .  i did n't think you would mind so much  .  
 never do that again  .  
why do n't you sit down and relax  darling  ?  
 i do n't want to  .  
 well  come over and talk to me then  .  
 certainly not  .  
 may i turn on the tv then  ?  
 turn on the tv for what  ?  
 so that we can sit down together and listen to some music  .  
 listen to the music  ?  and who will cook dinner  will you  ?  
 i will  but let 's go to the disco after dinner  .  
flight be407 to rome is delayed  .  will passengers please wait in the lounge  .  
 oh  how annoying  !  
 the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible  .  
hey  sorry to be late  .  
 what happened to you last night  ?  you didn  t show up  .  
 my mother was ill  .  i had to look after her  .  
excuse me  i wonder if you could help me  ?  
 of course  what can i do for you  ?  
 well  i hate to have to say this  but i 'm not happy with my room  .  
 oh  what exactly is problem  ?  
 well  the traffic is very loud  .  i got no sleep last night  .  
is anything the matter  sir  ?  
 yes  it 's my steak  .  
 what 's wrong with it  sir  ?  
 it 's too raw  .  i wanted mine well done  but this one here is almost medium  .  
 i am sorry you did n't enjoy it  sir  .  i will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked  .  how is your steak this time  sir  ?  
 very good  .  it 's done just right this time  thank you  .  
 i am glad you enjoy it  .  i will tell this to the chef  .  would you like some more beer  ?  
 yes  please give me another calsberg  .  
 can i bring you some dessert  ?  
 no  thank you  .  i 've had enough  .  
 how about some coffee or tea then  ?  
excuse me  i bought this sweater yesterday  .  but when i got home and tried it on  i found it  s too small  .  
 do you have the receipt with you  ?  
 yes  here you are  .  
 thank you  .  do you want your money back  ?  
 no  can i exchange it for a bigger one  ?  
 i am afraid this is the biggest size we have  .  
 oh  that 's too bad  .  
hello  is this eye computers  ?  
 yeas  it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help  ?  
 actually  i 'm calling to complain about your service  .  the computer i bought last week is faulty  .  
 oh  i 'm sorry to hear that  sir . what exactly is problem  ?  
 well  easily  it does n't work  .  it does n't even start probably  .  
i must apologize for having delayed the work  .  
 no  that  s not all your fault  .  
 but you will miss your good chance  .  i  m so sorry 
on  darn  .  the grocery store is closed  .  
 yeah  this one closes at ten  .  we could drive to the 24  hour store on sixth  .  
 alright  .  we are out of everything  .  
 i wish the store close to us was open 24  house a day  .  
 i know  our schedules are so weird  .  sometimes  the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that  s open when we get home  .  
 yeah  and the prices there are very high  .  
howdy  !  nice car  !  what seems to be the problem  ?  
 i don  t know  !  this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me  .  luckily  i managed to start it up and drive it here  .  what do you think it is  ?  
 not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look  .  mmmm  it doesn  t look good  .  
 what do you mean  ?  my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month  .  it  s brand new  !  
 well missy  the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator  .  you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission  .  you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died  .  
 ugh  .  .  .  so how long is this going to take  ?  an hour  ?  
 i  m afraid a bit more than that  .  we need to order the spare parts  take apart your electrical system  fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again  .  you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks  .  
lady  you look unhappy  .  what  s the beef  ?  
you are late  .  what  s the deal  ?  
oh  no  !  i  ve been assigned to work with jerry for our group project  .  
you have your ducks in a row  .  
you are an eager beaver  .  
mom  .  my legs are killing me  .  
hey  your chinese is coming along  !  
 you think  ?  
 yeah  .  it  s a lot better than mine  .  
 but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy  .  
let  s cross here  .  
 you  re kidding  .  we  ll never make it across in one piece  !  let  s cross at the light  .  
 now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street  .  
driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind  .  
 yeah  .  i think so . you have to be patient and careful  .  
 so i 'd rather walk or run to work  .  
i  ve had it  !  i  m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere  !  
 so what are you gonna do  ?  just quit  ?  
 that  s exactly what i am going to do  !  i  ve decided to create my own company  !  i  m going to write up a business plan  get some investors and start working for myself  !  
 have you ever written up a business plan before  ?  
 well  no . it can  t be that hard  !  i mean  all you have to do is explain your business  how you are going to do things and that  s it  right  ?  
 you couldn  t be more wrong  !  a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less  .  then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has  history  etc  .  
 well  that seems easy enough  .  
 wait  there  s more  !  then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services  .  what they are and how they are different from competitors   ?  then comes the hard part  a market analysis  .  you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables  !  you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has  !  all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage  where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea  .  
 geez  .  is that all  ?  
 almost  the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis  .  here you will calculate and estimate sales  cash flow and profits  .  after all  people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment  !  
hello there  !  come on in  !  don  t just stand there  !  come and take a seat  !  
 um  okay  .  well  i just want a trim  .  nothing too fancy  .  
 oh my gosh  !  your hair is amazing  !  so silky  so shiny  !  i am going to work my magic on your hair  !  you hear me  ?  you are going to look like a million bucks  !  
 okay  .  um  .  .  .  can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top  .  
 don  t you worry  i  ll take care of everything  !  oh my god  !  i just love your curly hair  !  it  s so fluffy and cute  !  you should totally let it grow out  .  an afro would look great on you  !  
 um  .  .  .  no  .  
what do you think of this one  ?  
 eh  so so  .  
 and this one  ?  too flashy  ?  
 nah  not too flashy  .  
 hug  !  and this sweater from my aunt  ?  isn  t it hideous  ?  
 i guess  .  
 are you even listening  ?  i  m trying to have a conversation with you  .  
 and i  m trying to watch the game  but you  re yapping on about your new clothes  !  
 well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon  !  
 well could you do me the favor of making this quick  ?  it  s the third quarter and you  ve been blabbering on since the first  !  
 oh  your precious game  .  you watch the same game every year  and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals  !  
 oh no you didn  t  .  you didn  t just insult the salsbury seals  did you  ?  why don  t you just  .  just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over  ?  
 i might just  !  enjoy your stupid game  !  
 and merry christmas  !  
hey  mary  can you cut that out  ?  
 cut what out i  m not doing anything  .  
 the tapping of your pen on your desk  .  it  s driving me crazy  .  
 fine  !  by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup  !  
 i don  t slurp my coffee  .  and plus  how can you hear it when you  re shouting into your phone all the time  ?  
 you  ve got to be kidding me  !  you  re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze  ?  
 look  we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions  and it  s probably okay to let off steam once in a while  .  but  it  s probably not a good idea to keep it up i  m willing to forgive and forget and if you are  .  
 fine  .  let 's call a truce  .  i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down  .  
the mosquitos are biting me  !  
 me  too  i can  t stop scratching  .  they are everywhere  !  sneaky little jerks  .  
 do you have any bug spray  ?  
 no  i forgot to buy some  .  
 then we  ll have to put up with it  .  
 we can cover ourselves with beer  !  that way if they bite us  they  ll get drunk and fall asleep  .  
 that  s without a doubt  the best idea you  ve had  !  let  s do it  !  
what are you doing  ?  
 look at me  .  i look so old  !  i look as if i were thirty  .  
 come on  !  stop being so vain  .  you look great  !  you are beautiful  !  
 yes  i am  but i think it  s time for some plastic surgery i  m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin  .  see  ?  
 i don  t see any wrinkles or sagging skin  !  you are stop beings ridiculous  .  besides  i think that people who get boto  have facelifts  or tummy tucks look weird . it doesn  t look natural  .  
 whatever  i think i  m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well  .  
 i think you need to get brain surgery  .  i honestly don  t think you need cosmetic surgery . you look amazing  .  
 i thought you were my friend and would support me on this  !  i just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive  .  
 you don  t need plastic surgery to do that  .  you are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you  !  plus  plastic surgery hurts  !  
 really  ?  
honey come on  !  we are going to be late  !  honestly  you take longer getting ready than i do  !  
 i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt  !  can you come here for a sec  ?  i need your help  .  
 what is it  ?  why are all these clothes on the bed  ?  
 i don  t know what to wear  !  ok  give me your opinion  .  do you like the way this looks  ?  the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals  .  i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i  ll wear these as well  .  
 are you joking  ?  what am i going to do with you  ?  we are going to a dinner party not the beach  !  wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants  .  it  s chilly outside so you can wear this coat  .  
wow  that terrible movie is finally over  .  next time i  m picking the film  because i don  t want to end up seeing a chick flick  .  
 well you should have picked  in the end you always complain about everything  .  
 not everything  just this film  .  even the title is ridiculous  .  and it  s so long  those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life  so much so that i  m thinking about asking them to give me my money back  .  
 i  m thinking of taking you back home  .  i thought we could have a nice evening  but you  re always so negative  .  
 i  m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage  .  
 you see  that  s what i  m talking about  i can  t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore 
 next time  go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings  .  
 well he  s more of a man than you are  at least he appreciates love stories  .  
 love stories  ?  more like onenightstands  .  
 don  t criticize mario or else i  ll start on those fat  drunk friends of yours  they  re no saints  .  
 my friends  ?  fat  ?  what about those whales you call friends  ?  
honey  i  ll be right back  !  
 where are you going  ?  
 i told you already  !  i  m going to get my nails done  .  
 again  ?  you just went last week  !  you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home  !  honestly  why do you need a manicure every week  ?  
 well  first of all  i like to pamper myself  and my nails look great  .  you should come with me  !  
 why  ?  i don  t want to have nail polish or anything like that  !  
 they don  t only paint my nails  !  the manicurist will remove my cuticles  file my nails  and apply at least nails coats of nail polish  !  
hi dude  you look upset  what 's up  ?  
 have n't been sleeping well recently  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 every night my roommates watch the korean soap operas till midnight  .  i am not a big fan of korean shows and i do n't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings  .  
 well  you can simply tell them you want to sleep  or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down  .  
 yeah  i know  but i find these sorts of things hard to say  .  they wo n't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv  .  now i just hope the show will end soon  .  
 i understand  .  i used to live in a dorm with four people  .  i was great in some aspects  .  we always went out and and had fun together  .  but on the other hand  when i wanted some quiet time  and people kept 
tom  i 've got good news for you  .  
 what is it  ?  
 have n't you heard that your novel has won the nobel prize  ?  
 really  ?  i ca n't believe it  .  it 's like a dream come true  .  i never expected that i would win the nobel prize  !  
 you did a good job  .  i 'm extremely proud of you  .  
 thanks for the compliment  .  
let 's go in  .  
thanks for your hospitality  .  
i 've come to say goodbye  .  
 when do you leave  ?  
 i 'm catching the 1100 train  .  
 take care of yourself and do n't forget to keep in touch  .  
hi  .  what 's up  ?  
 nothing much  .  what 's new with you  ?  
 not too much  .  i 've been pretty busy  .  
 me too  .  seems like all i do is eat and sleep  .  
 gotta go  .  call me tonight  .  
what happened  ?  
guess what  ?  
hello  john  .  how are you  ?  
 i 'm fine  thanks  .  and you  ?  
 very well  thanks  .  nice to see you again  .  i have n't seen you for a long time  .  what have you been doing lately  ?  
 oh  nothing much really  .  and how is everything with you  ?  
 fine  thanks  .  i 've been busy lately  .  
 what have you been doing  ?  
 i 've been studying for my exams  .  my school exams will begin next month  .  
 really  ?  good luck for them  .  
 thanks  .  and how are your parents  ?  
 they 're both very well  thanks  .  
 where are you going now  ?  
 i 'm going to do some shopping  .  why do n't you come with me  ?  
 i ca n't  .  i have to meet someone  .  
 it 's been nice talking to you  .  
why are you all dressed up  ?  
hey  there 's leo  .  i wonder why he 's walking arm in arm with that young woman  .  
 it 's as plain as the nose on your face  .  they 're dating each other  .  
 you 're pulling my leg  !  she must be thirty years younger than leo  .  talk about robbing the cradle  !  
 well  you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan  .  
 it must have been love at first sight because i know he did n't have a girlfriend last week  .  
well  my particular interest is collecting stamps  especially the rare ones  .  what about you  ?  
 i  m afraid that  s not my cup of tea  .  i just find skindiving attracting  .  
i heard that kevin got divorced  .  is that true  ?  
 not so bad  but kevin does have problems with his wife  .  
 what  ?  
 his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion  .  
 poor kevin  we should do something for him  .  he is a nice guy and does his job well  .  
actually i have a passion for chinese literature  .  
 you do  ?  
 yeah  those classics from the great writers  .  
so what kind of music turns you on  ?  
 rock n'roll  i guess  .  
 you mean the kind of stuff like nirvana  ?  
how do you feel  ?  
do n't be shy  .  have some more chicken  .  
hi  it is a pleasant surprise  !  
 yeah  it  s been ages  !  so how have you been  ?  
 couldn  t be better  .  and you  ?  
i 'm feeling hungry  .  
 is n't it time for dinner  ?  
 yes  let 's get something to eat  .  
the boy threw up  .  
shall we go for a drive today  ?  
 it feels like there 's going to be rain later  .  
 maybe you 're right  .  
i would n't dare go bungee jumping  .

 yes  let 's go in  .  
 it is a new park  is n't it  ?  
 yes  how do you know  ?  
 i guessed it  .  
 well  generally speaking  the park is a window on the world history  a window on the world civilization and a window on the world 's tourist attractions as well  .  
did you have a good holiday  ?  
sorry  .  i 've got to run  .  
do you know where helen is  ?  
 she 's gone to a flower shop  .  today is her husband 's birthday  .  
did you hear about neil  ?  
 no  what  ?  
 i hear that he 's quitting  .  
 you 're kidding  !  
what sports do you think women excel at most  ?  
 i think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in  like football  .  
 i mean which ones are they better at than men  ?  
 why do you care  ?  women and men are different all around  .  i do n't think they can be compared  .  
 that 's a good point  .  let me change my question  .  what sports do women like best  ?  
 well  i know some women who love golf and i know others who love contact sports  .  
 are you saying that women ca n't be generally categorized  ?  
hey  peter  have you had lunch yet  ?  
 no  .  how about you  ?  
what 's your favorite season  ?  
 i like the freedom of summer with no school  .  
 yeah  and all those fun summer sports and activities  .  
 and i like the festivities of winter with thanksgiving  christmas and new year  .  
 oh  me too  !  all the family getting together  .  .  .  
 and i really like the smells and colors of spring  .  
 i like the feeling then that school is almost over  !  
this is the end  jane  .  i do n't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time  .  
 i wo n't do it again  .  please forgive me  .  
how was your trip to brazil  ?  did you learn anything  ?  
 i had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer  !  
 tell me about it  .  
 okay  .  in the middle of their streets there are parks  big soccer fields as far as you can see  .  
 really  ?  
 that 's not all  .  they use them  !  every night men  women  children all out there till 3 and 4 a  .  m  .  
 are you serious  ?  
you 'll never guess what i won at work today  !   tickets to tonight 's final nba game  .  
 two  i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me  !  
 of course  !  and here 's the best part  they are court side seats  !  
 how in the world  !  who came up with seats like that from your company  ?  
 some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team  !  
 ca n't beat that  !  thank you accounting guy  !  
 the game starts at seven so we 'd better hustle  it 's already five  .  
i 've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad  .  i wonder how you managed to achieve such success  ?  
 oh  through a lot of hard work  of course  .  
 i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first  was n't it  ?  
 surely it was  especially when you only knew few people and little english  .  
 you mean you did n't know much english then  ?  
 right  .  i only knew a few english sentences  .  
 that 's incredible  .  could you tell me what you did to make a start  ?  
 first  i worked as a servant  .  
 really  ?  i wish you could tell me more about your experience  .  
what are you reading  ?  you 've had your nose buried in that book since last night  .  
 this book is so good  .  i just ca n't put it down  !  it 's called the power of one  .  
 i have n't read a book like that for as long as i can remember  .  
 me either  .  from the very first page  this author just pulled me right in  !  
 can i read it when you 're finished  ?  
 yes  .  i 'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping  .  
 do n't tell me anything about it  .  i want to read it for myself  .  
how do you think about our boss  ?  
 he 's the nicest boss i 've had  .  
 yes  i think he 's the most relaxing person in management  .  
 what 's more  he said i was the hardest working person in the office  !  
 that 's good  .  maybe you 'll get promoted  .  
merry christmas  bill  !  
 merry christmas  .  steven  !  
 what do you want to do to celebrate christmas  ?  
 i 'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping  .  what about you  ?  
 i 'll go to church first and then go to a christmas party  .  would you like to come  ?  
 i 'd love to  .  but i am going to meet my girlfriend right now  .  see you later  .  
she is so beautiful  is n't she  ?  
 who  ?  
 julia roberts  .  
 yeah  she is so charming  .  i like her  too  .  
 it 's said that her new movie is going to come out  .  
 what 's the movie about  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 is n't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about  ?  
 i already told you  because julia roberts is in it  .  i like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities  .  
merry christmas  lily  .  
 the same to you  joey  .  
 this is your first christmas in the us  .  here is the gift for you  .  
 it 's very thoughtful of you  .  wow  it is so beautiful  .  could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas  ?  
hey  dora  !  what kind of books do you like to read  ?  
 i read everything i can get my hands on but i like love stories best  .  what do you think about the love stories  ?  
 i hate to tell you this  but they are nothing but sob stories  .  
 i do n't think so  .  i like them  .  then what 's your favorite book  ?  
 i 'm fond of history books  .  
i 've heard of groundlevel ozone but can you explain what it is exactly  ?  
 yes  it 's one of the main air pollutants  .  factories do n't emit it directly into the air  .  it 's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and voc emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight  .  
 sorry  ?  what does voc stand for  ?  
 oh  vous are volatile organic compounds  .  that 's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint  .  
 so  what damage does ozone do to the environment  ?  
jack  what do you think about the election  ?  
 i think the campaign is a blockbuster  .  
 how many people have flung their hats into the ring  ?  
 finally 100 candidates ran for one seat  .  
 who do you think will be elected  ?  
 it 's hard to say  .  they all had an active campaign to round up the votes  .  
 i think mr  .  white would be elected  you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech  .  
is the lake very polluted  ?  
 well  i would n't swim in it  but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago  .  
 are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake  ?  
have you heard that tom and his wife divorced  ?  
 i did n't hear that  .  but i can deduce the reason  .  
 really  ?  say it  !  
 tom is a kind guy  but addicted to gambling  .  he spends all his time gambling in the casino  .  and his wife ca n't put up with his incessant gambling any longer  so she divorced him  .  is that right  ?  
 yeah  quite right  .  gambling broke up a happy family  .  
 yeah  !  gambling is often a curse  .  by gambling we lose time and treasure  two things most precious to a man  .  
 besides that  many people took to gambling and got in over their heads  and gradually ruined themselves  .  
it rumored that jean is fooling around with another woman's husband  .  
 you gossip  !  what 's the basis of your opinion  ?  
 someone declared that he saw it  .  
 i do n't believe it  .  jean is such a kind lady  .  how could she do this  ?  
 who knows  ?  you ca n't judge a book by its cover  .  
can you tell which team seems to win  ?  
 hard to say  .  now the score is in our favor  .  
 yes  .  our guest team is really tough  .  
we 'll miss you while you 're studying in the united states  .  
ok  hello  !  
 hello  !  
 hi  what 's your name  ?  
 yeah  my name is nandu  .  
 nandu  .  nandu  how do you spell you name  ?  
 yeah  my name is like nanju  .  
 oh  ok  .  that 's a nice name  nandu  .  and where are you from  ?  
what 's the score  ?  
 the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half  .  
 the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final  .  
is the chinese team taking the lead  ?  
 no  it 's the japanese team  .  
 japanese teams always play a dark horse  .  
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50  .  
 they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21  .  
 if the phoenix beats the rocket  it will enter the final  .  
in the discus throw  you scored 30 meters at the final throw  .  how did you make it  ?  
 well  i 've been practising for 5 weeks  .  
 is this your best score  ?  
i think he deserved his gold  .  
 did you see his last dive  .  
 yes  it 's perfect  !  
hey mike  .  what are you doing  ?  
 nothing much  .  what are you up to  ?  
 i was just concerned about sam  .  he has n't been himself lately  .  
 he took the civil service exam and failed  .  
 that sucks  .  he must feel depressed  .  
 yeah  .  he 's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days  .  
 why do n't we take him out  ?  we can try to take his mind off of it  .  in the least show him that we 're there for him  .  
 that 's a great idea  .  why do n't you call him  .  i already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else  .  
 ok  .  i 'll call you back after i 'm done  .  
which team won  ?  
 the spur  .  
 what was the score  ?  
who do you think is going to get the oscar for best actor  ?  
i do n't stand a chance of passing the exam  .  
i do n't think the manager will get mad at you for being late  .  
i want to redo this poster  but john and mary think it 's good enough as it is  .  
did you know carl is almost fifty  ?  
 are you sure  ?  he does n't look that old  .  
the bridegroom looks a bit nervous  .  
 on this occasion  most people do  .  
 oh  they are playing the wedding march  .  here they come  .  
 she is a beautiful bride  .  
 i am so happy for them  .  
 are you crying  ?  
 yes  i always cry at weddings  .  
 harris and anne are perfect for each other  .  
 yes  they are  .  
 you and tom also make a great couple  .  
 in fact  we are beginning to make preparations  .  
 for the wedding  ?  
 no  no  for the engagement  .  
good morning  miss wu  !  can i ask you something  ?  
 certainly  .  you are more welcome to do  .  what is it  ?  
 tomorrow is my wife 's birthday  .  we both love spicy chinese dishes  .  i am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where i can find some good spicy dishes  .  
 well  if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for  in hua restaurant is the best place to go  .  the restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes  .  you might want to try there  .  
 how far is it from here  ?  
 it is near the university  .  five minutes walk from your flat  i think  .  
 great  .  we 'll go and have a try  .  thank you very much  .  
 you 're welcome  .  may you have a good time  .  please give my regards to your wife  .  i wish her a happy birthday tomorrow  .  
what are your plans for today  ?  
 nothing special  .  
 would you like to have dinner with me at king hotel at 7pm  ?  
tom  did you see the film last night  ?  
 yes  i did  i thought it was a failure  .  
 do you really think so  ?  i do n't think so  .  it was n't that bad film at all  .  did n't you hear the applause of the audience  ?  
 well  maybe so  .  but i still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion  .  
hello  anna speaking  !  
 hey  anna  this is jason  .  
 jason  where have you been hiding lately  ?  you know it 's been a long time since your last call  .  have you been good  ?  
 yes  .  how are you  anna  ?  
 i am fine  .  what have you been doing  ?  
 working  .  i 've been really busy these days  .  i got a promotion  .  
 that 's great  congratulations  !  
 thanks  .  i am feeling pretty good about myself too  .  you know  bigger office  a raise and even an assistant  .  
 that 's good  .  so i guess i 'll have to make an appointment to see you  .  
 you are kidding  .  
 how long have you been working there  ?  
 a bit over two years  .  this is a fastmoving company  and seniority isn  t the only factor in deciding promotions  .  
 how do you like your new boss  ?  
 she is very nice and openminded  .  
 much better than the last one  huh  ?  
 yeah  .  he was a real slave driver  .  he probably would have loved it if we were robots  .  
 forget about him  .  come over to my house tonight  .  let 's get drunk  .  
 good  .  tonight 8 o 'clock  .  
 8 it is  .  see you then  .  
so beth  what kind of music do you listen to  ?  
 i listen to a lot of hip hop  .  what about you  ?  
 i mostly listen to pop music  but i like a lot of different stuff  .  
what are the pop groups that you like  ?  
 oh  there are so many good ones  !  i loved the spice girls  .  they were so cool  !  
 i agree  !  i cried for a week when they broke up  .  
what about you  ernie  ?  how did you get into pop music  ?  
 well i always hear it on the radio  so i started to get into it  .  
 yeah  if something is on the radio it must be really good  .  
how did you meet your girlfriend  ?  
 i met amanda through a friend  .  
 that 's great  .  did you start dating right after you met  or did you become friends first  ?  
do you remember john from head office  ?  
 yes  .  
 have you heard what happened to him  ?  
 no  what  ?  
 he had his car stolen  .  actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 well  apparently  he was just getting into his carhe 'd parked it in one of those underground multistory thingshe was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in  .  
 crikey  .  where did this happen  ?  
 in taichung  i think  .  
 oh  right  i hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there  .  
 really  ?  well  anyway  they pointed their guns at him and said  you know  keep calm and drive out  .   .  .  .  we do n't want to hurt you  .  .  .  we just want your car  .  
 so what happened  ?  
 well  he drove out  and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant  he pretended to have an epileptic fit  you know  to scare the thieves away  .  the attendant was no help at all  even though the guys were holding guns in plain view  he did nothing  .  
 that 's terrible  .  
 yes  makes you think  does n't it  ?  
 so what happened next  ?  
 well  he kept on pretending to have a fit  so they freaked out and just ran away  .  
 well  he sure was lucky  .  
ernie  i 'm really excited about starting this band together  .  we 're going to be the two coolest students on campus  .  
 i know  !  it 's gonna be great  .  but what kind of music do you think we should play  ?  
 that 's a good question  .  you know i love hip hop  so maybe we can play some vanilla ice songs  .  
 hmm  .  .  .  vanilla ice  ?  i know his most famous song   ice ice baby   but i do n't know his other songs  .  
that sounds pretty good  .  but is n't downloading music illegal  ?  
 not if you pay for it  .  for example  if you download from itunes and pay with your credit card  it 's legal  .  
 ok  i 'm going to get itunes and download some vanilla ice songs  .  
how did you first meet  ?  
 my roommate invited both of us to dinner  .  
 was it love at first sight  ?  did you fall in love with her the first time you met her  ?  
when did you and amanda meet each other  ?  
 i met her about one year ago  .  
 so you met her right after you got to school  ?  
so you said you and amanda met through a mutual friend  .  how did it happen  ?  
 well  my roommate was friends with amanda  so he introduced us  .  
 did he tell you what she was like first  ?  
merry christmas  mr  .  wang  .  i would like to give you the book i specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days  .  
 thanks  mr  .  white  .  that 's very kind of you  .  
 i hope it will be of some use to you  .  
 i am sure it will  .  it 'll be of great help in carrying on the work i have done so far  .  
hi  tina  i 've got good news  .  i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company  .  they informed me to go to the final round next monday  .  it looks very promising  .  
 that is awesome  .  congratulations  !  i know you can make it  .  
 thanks  .  let 's go for a celebration this evening  .  are you free  ?  
 yes  .  wait for me at the cafe down my office building  .  say 5 pm  ok  ?  
 no problem  .  see you  !  
could you tell me something about the midautumn festival  ?  i find it also very interesting  .  
 ok  .  it falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month  .  it is said that there is a beautiful goddess chang 'e on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband  .  she is always expecting to see her husband again  .  so  later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon  it is time for the family members to come together  .  
 so  i understand why people eat moon cakes on that day  .  
 you are right  .  in china  round is an auspicious word  .  the moon cakes are in round shape  .  
 is it official  ?  
hi  .  bob  !  we 've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight  .  so why do n't we take it easy this weekend  ?  
 okay  !  what do you suggest  ?  
 how about seeing a play  ?  i hear hamlet is on at the national theater  .  
 is that so  ?  why not  ?  
  looking at a newspaper  oh  dear me  !  there 's no performance at the national theater this weekend  .  so we have to go to cinema instead  .  
 what 's on  ?  
 let me see  .  .  um  .  gone with the wind  .  it is on at six cinemas on saturday night  .  
 that sounds interesting  .  which is the nearest  ?  
 ah  .  the royal  i think  .  
 what time does it start  ?  
 why do n't we go to the 730 show  ?  it is convenient to us  i think  .  
 but we wo n't have enough time for dinner  .  
 do you want to go to the earlier or the later show  ?  
 ah  .  .  .  i fancy going to the later show  .  
 then  there 's a 930 show  .  
 that 's okay  i think  .  
mr  .  wilson  here 's a present for you  .  
 oh  you are so nice  .  what a lovely scarf  .  
 i hope you will like it  .  
the spring festival is drawing close  .  by then we will have five days off  .  i am expecting it  .  
 can you tell me something about the spring festival  ?  
 just like you celebrate christmas  we celebrate our lunar new year 's day  the spring festival  .  it is a time for the family members and relatives to have a gettogether  .  
 christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year  .  
 christmas has more religious nature  while our spring festival is a more traditional holiday  .  on the new year 's eve  we have a big dinner called family reunion dinner  .  one of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings  .  after that  the adults usually sit chatting  watching tv  or playing cards  .  
 what are the children doing  ?  
 they usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks  .  
 i heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year  .  
 perhaps it is like what people told you  .  at 24 hours midnight  the time when the new year really comes  we exchange happy new year to each other  and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper  in them are some what we call lucky money  .  
 who will get the money  ?  
we are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center  .  
 that 's great  .  
 now let 's get things ready  .  
 do n't worry  .  there are all kinds of things in the center  .  
what 's that  a new video game  ?  
 nope  !  it 's the latest generation of pad  !  you wo n't believe what it can do  .  
 for instance  ?  
 it has a builtin camera unit that takes digital color stills  .  it also plays mp3 files  which i can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer  .  
 wow  !  anything else  ?  
 this one comes with its own folding keyboard  .  it has a preinstalled handwriting recognition program  .  i can use the stylus to write on the screen  .  
 what if i want to use cdroms or floppies  ?  
when will the ceremony begin  ?  
 the ceremony will begin at 9 0 clock  .  after the ceremony  there 's a reception  .  by the way  do you know why they have chosen september 9th for their wedding ceremony  ?  
 no idea  .  
it 's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding  .  
 how can i forget my old friend  ?  
 my best wishes to you and the bride  !  
i am very interested in a new apartment near the taxing plaza  but the price is very high  i really ca n't afford it  .  
 how much is it for each square meter  ?  how large is the apartment  ?  
 it 's 7500 yuan per square meter  and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room  .  its total area is about 80 square meters  .  
 that surely will cost you a lot of money  .  are you going to make a full payment  ?  
 do you think i am rich enough to make it  ?  i am thinking about buying the apartment by installments  .  the real estate agency says if i pay a 25  down payment  i can move in at once  .  
hey  look over there  .  it seems that there is something interesting going on  .  let 's go and have a look  .  
 sure  .  it 's probably a skiing show  .  adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors  .  
 look at that  .  it 's so dangerous  .  my mom would never allow me to do that  .  
 stop all this fuss and enjoy the show  .  
 you are right  .  but what if an avalanche happened  ?  
 they are all great skiers and very experienced  .  so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim  .  
 anyway  the show is breathtaking  .  by the way  where did they get so much snow here  ?  
 well  they have the most advanced snowmaking machine  .  
 do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution  ?  
congratulations  !  mr  .  stuart  !  you won the city marathon  .  
 thank you  .  i am very excited  .  
 we are all very proud of you  .  
 i am very happy  too  .  it was a big game and i won  .  
 i watched the race with my children  .  we saw you run to the finish line  .  we all screamed with excitement  .  
i like to stay here  .  
 why  ?  
 people are very kind down your way  .  you  re lucky  .  
 yes  do you always gather to welcome new comers  ?  
 never  .  
 really  ?  
just make yourself at home  .  
 thank you  .  you are cooking up a storm  .  
 would n't you like some more chicken  ?  
you have made a poor meal  .  let me get you some more fish  .  
 no  thanks  .  i have had enough  .  
 what about some drink  ?  
the idea about friday the thirteenth is totally ridiculous  .  i do n't believe it at all  .  
 maybe you ca n't be so sure  .  
 why not  ?  the whole idea is superstitious  .  
 but some people use this occasion to create trouble  .  have you heard of the black friday virus on the computer  ?  it is designed to break out on every friday the thirteenth  .  
where did you go yesterday  ?  
 i went to croydon  .  
 did you go shopping  ?  
 no  i went for an interview  .  
 oh  did you get a job  ?  
 yes  i got a job as a management trainee  .  
oh  it 's getting late  .  i 've got to run  .  it was nice talking to you  karren  .  
 thanks  tim  .  nice meeting you  too  .  
 i guess we 'll see each other around  .  
 yeah  i hope so  .  well  take it easy  .  
excuse me  is this seat taken  ?  
 er  .  .  .  no  go ahead  .  
 you work upstair  right  ?  i think i have seen you before  .  i 'm karren  karren brown  .  
 nice to meet you  karren  .  i 'm tim wang  .  
i know you are a good dancer  .  what dances do you like  ?  
 i like the old styles of dance  .  such as foxtrot  waltz  rumba  tango and so on  .  they 're all graceful  .  
 why do you like old styles of dance  ?  
 why not  ?  do you think i should like modern dance  ?  
 i think so  because most young people like modern dances  such as rock and roll  .  
 oh  sorry  .  i do n't like them  .  why not ask lily  .  she likes modern dance  .  
people of different races are fit for quite different sports  .  for instance  asians are especially good fattable tennis  badminton  diving and shooting  .  they seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports  in which flexibility  agility and quick reflexes are favorable  .  
 and a typical example has been the chinese athletes at the beijing olympics  right  ?  
 yes  in all these four sports  .  the chinese olympic dream teams led the way  .  they swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving  .  
 then what are the westerners fit for  ?  
 i think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity  speed and explosive force like swimming  field games  etc  .  
 where do you think the edge is for black athletes  ?  
 it 's common sense that african athletes always make a clean sweep in track events  middle or long distance races  relays  hurdles  barriers  and marathon  .  
how is night life in beijing  ?  
 very interesting  !  
 what do you suggest then  ?  
 how about going to dance  ?  there is a very good nightclub nearby  .  
 that 's a great idea  .  let 's go  .  .  .  oh  the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful  .  
 i 'm glad you like it . the band is called  four and one   .  they are especially good at playing rock and roll  .  
 that 's great  !  i love to dance to fast music  .  
 then you must be interested in disco dancing  are n't you  ?  
 yes  disco dancing is my favorite . it s great fun and good exercise as well  .  
 ok  .  let 's disco  .  
 now the band is playing a slow dance  .  
 that 's a waltz  .  would you like to try it  ?  
 sorry  i think i 'il sit out the next dance  .  
may i invite you for a dance  ?  
 with pleasure  .  
 you dance well  .  do you breakdance  ?  
 me  what brought that on  ?  
 there 's a story about breakdancing in the paper  .  
 what does it say  ?  
 according to the story  it 's some sort of modern dance style  .  
 like disco  ?  
 well  breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance  .  
 and disco a kind of nightclub  .  
 right  a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music  .  .  .  
 so  .  .  .  disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it . and breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether  .  
how do you like this waltz  ?  
 it 's very nice  i like it very much  .  
 well  then  may i invite you for the first dance  ?  
 my pleasure  .  but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer  and i suppose you dance often  .  
 me  ?  oh  no  .  in fact  i took up dancing quite recently  .  
 oh  really  ?  but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well  .  
 i 'm glad you say so  you dance beautifully too  .  it 's lucky that i got a partner  .  
 thank you for your compliments . it s just that you are a good leader  .  do you like the foxtrot and tango  ?  
 yes  .  and what dances do you do best  ?  
 disco is my favorite  .  i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's pentup feelings  and is a healthy exercise  .  but i do n't do the rock and roll and the break dance  .  
 oh  well  the music has stopped  .  thank you for the dance  .  
 my pleasure  .  let 's go and have a drink  .  
what 's your favorite sport  ?  
 it 's hard to say  .  perhaps swimming is my favorite  .  i like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity  .  in the scorching summer days  there 's nothing like a cool swim  .  currently  i go to the pool twice every week  .  
 is the entrance charge expensive  ?  
 well  it costs an arm and a leg  30 yuan per person  .  what a costly sport  !  that is why i have to refrain from even thinking about it  .  and i find jogging a very agreeable substitute  .  
 haha  jogging  ?  perhaps it might be a bit too boring  ?  
 you know what  ?  you wo n't get a rush from it until you fully understand it  .  it is a simple sport and does n't require skills of any sort  .  this leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging  .  fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest  which translates into inspirations  .  inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me  .  sometimes  i even come up with a verse or two  .  
it 's rather cold  is n't it  ?  
 oh  yes  it is  .  
 shall i light the stove  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  
 well  what 's the climate like in your country  ?  
 it 's mild  but it 's not always pleasant  .  
 which season do you like best  ?  
how nice it is here  .  
 you can say that again . the sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze . it s so lovely  .  
 i 've heard the weather here is ideal  just like spring most of the year  .  
the weather in beijing is just beautiful  !  
 autumn is the best season in beijing  you know  .  
 yes  i can see  .  the summer heat is over  and the winter cold is still far away  .  
 what is the weather like in washington at this time of this year  ?  
 autumn is also very nice in washington  .  
 is it very cold in winter there  ?  
 no  it is n't  .  but sometimes it snows a lot in winter  .  
 does it rain a lot in summer there  ?  
 oh yes  !  sometimes it rains very heavily . how about here in beijing  ?  
 there 's a lot of rain in summer  but it seldom rains in autumn  .  
 i feel it 's rather dry here  .  
 that 's true  .  many people from the south do n't like the weather here  .  
 are you from the south  ?  
 no  i 'm from the north  .  i was born in beijing  actually  .  
i really like the record you lent me the other day  .  
 i 'm glad you like it  .  
 and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long  .  
 not at all  .  
 i 'm most grateful  .  everyone in our class enjoyed it  .  
 i 'm glad  .  
may i have a word with you  ?  
 certainly  .  
 when will you be free  ?  
 come by any time  .  
 shall i say around ten o 'clock  ?  
are you free this saturday evening  ?  
 oh  it seems there is nothing that evening  .  
 would you like to go to the concert with me  ?  
 i 'd like to  where  ?  
 at our club  .  
 when  ?  
 at 730 p  .  m  .  
 i 'll go in time  thank you  .  
wow  is that your sports car  ?  
 yes  do you like it  ?  
 i love it  !  i used to always want to drive a green jaguar  .  is it in good condition  ?  
 yt looks good on the outside  but the inside is a different story  .  it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again  .  
 what 's wrong with it  ?  
 well  first of all  it needs a new engine  which is extremely expensive  .  
 when's the last time you had it serviced  ?  
 it must have been a few years ago now  .  
 i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis  .  
 they do  .  once my son was born  there was no reason to drive this car anymore  .  it 's only a twoseater  you know  !  
 what else is wrong with it  ?  
 the heating controls do n't work anymore  so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car  even in the summer  !  
 anything else  ?  
 the brakes do n't really work that well anymore either  .  
 why do n't you get it all fixed  ?  
 it costs more than you think to run a carespecially when there are so many things wrong with it  !  
you did n't come to work yesterday . what happened  ?  
 i had to look after my son at home  .  
 what 's wrong with him  ?  
 he has a fever  .  
 is he getting better now  ?  
thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in china  .  
 and i must thank you again for your generous help  .  
 the help is mutual  .  i must thank you to see me off  .  my wife and i will be looking forward to seeing you  .  you will come to see us  wo n't you  ?  
annie  what is troubling you  ?  you look unhappy  .  
 a man is pursuing me  .  he was my schoolmate in college  and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years  .  
 do you like him  ?  
 yes  i do like him  .  
 then why are you hesitating  ?  
 you know that i have had a series of miserable relationships  .  last summer  i fell in love with john  .  but the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks  and then wilted  .  
 one love drives out another  .  you should n't be afraid to start a new relationship  .  
would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow  ?  
 much to my regret  i 'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then  .  
 we 'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening  are you free  ?  
 much as we 'd like to  but we 've booked up already for that time  .  
 what a pity  !  you ca n't join us  .  
ye ting  who are these people in the picture  ?  
 they 're my family 
 so you have two brothers  ?  
hello  !  so you are leaving today  .  
 hello  .  thank you for seeing me off  .  you actually do n't need to bother  .  
 it is my pleasure to see you off  .  
 thanks a lot  .  i hope to see you again  .  
 i hope so  too  .  
 thanks again for everything you have done for me  .  
i would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it   what could i about it anyway  ?  
 don  t say things like this  .  please be confident  .  i think you still have the chance to win her love  unless you don  t love her anymore  .  
 don  t you think she is a bit out of my way  ?  
 in some way  she is more modern  .  
 if i do try to do anything  i  d only be sent off with a flea in my ear  .  
well  i 'm thinking of going to see the ballet swan lake by the famous russian national ballet troupe this evening at beijing grand theater  .  why do n't you join me  ?  
 i 'd like to  but i 've got to write a term paper  .  it will be due by this thursday  .  
 you always work too hard  jim  .  as the saying goes  all work and no play makes jack a dull boy  .  you should spare some time for a rest  .  
 i know it is no good for my health if i am staying in the classroom all day  .  but how about my paper  ?  
 just take it easy  .  come on with me  .  
i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution  .  
 yes  i agree  .  the air here is much more polluted than in my country  .  
 that 's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry  .  
 yeah  you are right  .  
 we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years  but cars are still a major source of them  .  factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced  .  
 the problem is now on a truly global scale  .  i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it  .  
did you see the fashion awards last night  ?  
 i sat through about half of it but they lost me after that  .  
 not interested  ?  
 not really  to be honest  .  some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me  .  
 but they are showing what will be all the rage next year  .  
 all the rage with whom  ?  i never see anyone wearing these designs on the street  .  
 did you know that fashion is cyclical  ?  
 what  it keeps coming back  ?  
 precisely  !  for example  flares were popular for a while  then went out of fashion  .  now we can start to see them coming back in again  .  
 flares  ?  
 they 're also known as bellbottoms  .  they are a type of trousers  .  
 it 's too complicated  .  i 'll just stick to the plain clothes  .  
how time flies  !  why i always feel have n't enough time to work and study  ?  
 yes  i also felt that  .  i 'm always busy  and have no time for rest  .  i don  t know how to make use of time  .  
 maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next  and follow it  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  and in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things  .  
 you are right  .  let  s stop idling around and do something  .  
you know  smoking does do harm to your health  .  
 yes  you 're right  .  
 why do n't you try to give it up  ?  
 i 've tried to give up smoking several times  but it 's no good  .  smoking relaxes me  .  
 have you ever thought of just cutting down  ?  you could do it gradually  .  
susan  did you know the four ugliest women in ancient china  ?  
 no  i only know four great beauties of china  .  
 there were some famous ugly women in history  .  
 yeah  ?  were they famous because of the ugliness  ?  
 though they were ugly  they had great virtue  .  
 then who were they  ?  
 mo mu  thong lichen  meng gang and ran nv  .  they were well respected  .  
 it seems that the inner beauty is also important  .  
jeff  i 'm going to the supermarket  .  do you want to come with me  ?  
 i think the supermarket is closed now  .  
 oh  when does it close  ?  
 it closes at 700 on sundays  .  
 that 's too bad  .  
 do n't worry  we can go tomorrow morning  .  it opens at 8 00  .  
 alright  .  what do you want to do now  ?  
 let 's take a walk for a half an hour  .  my sister will get here at about 8 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner  .  
 where does she live  ?  
 she lives in san francisco  .  
 how long has she lived there  ?  
 i think she 's lived there for about 10 years  .  
 that 's a long time  .  where did she live before that  ?  
you look tired  .  did you sleep well last night  ?  
 i stayed up all night writing a report  .  
charles  do you have any children  ?  
 yes  .  
 how many children do you have  ?  
 i have two kids  .  a boy and a girl  .

 i 'm not  .  
 step up onto the rail  .  hold on  .  keep your eyes closed  .  trust me  ?  
 i trust you  .  
 all right  open your eyes  .   rose opens her eyes  .  she stretches her arms  and jack stands behind her  arms around her  .   
this is my uncle  charles  .  
 he looks strong . what does he do  ?  
 he 's a captain  .  
 he must be very brave  .  
what a brilliant smile  !  
 that 's my cousin hubert  .  he likes smiling  .  
 he must be very easygoing  .  
your father looks much younger in the picture  .  
 he was 20 years old then  .  
 how old is he now  ?  
what shall i call him  ?  
 oh  you may call him uncle  or henry  .  
 what 's he doing  ?  
i heard many stories about your brother  .  
 he 's a hero in our town  .  
 what does he look like  ?  is he handsome  ?  
sorry to interrupt  .  can i have a word with you  ?  
after you  .  
 no  after you  .  ladies first  .  
hello  julia  i know a party that will begin at midnight  .  would you love to go  ?  
 i 'd love to  but my mother asks me to go home before 1100 every night  .  she will worry if i get home late  .  
 what a pity  !  the party is very interesting  .  
 i have no choice  .  my mother is always very strict with me  .  
 don  t complain about it  .  she is concerned about your safety  .  
tomorrow 's carl 's birthday  ?  
 yes . let s hold a birthday party for him  shall we  ?  
steven  have you any friend in london  ?  
 yes  my old friend hanson lives there 
 are you close  ?  
 yes  .  he 's one of my best friends  .  our friendship formed at college  .  why did you ask that  ?  
 i 'm going to london on business next week  .  but i know nothing about it  .  
 i get it  .  you want to find a guide  don  t you  ?  
 yes  steven  .  you always know what i want  .  
 don  t worry  .  i will call hanson  and ask him to help you  .  
bob is getting on in years  .  
 yeah  i 'm very worried about his health  .  
 he looks tired all the time  .  
did you go to the concert last weekend  ?  
 no  i did n't  .  and you  ?  was it good  ?  
 yes  .  i did  .  i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer  a violinist and a pianist  .  
 how much was the ticket  ?  
bob 's sister will go to america  .  
 why tell me  ?  she has nothing to do with me  !  
 i thought you wanted to know more about her  .  
would you like to go to a concert tonight  ?  
 i 'd like to very much  .  
 all right  then . there is one at the new concert hall  .  
 who 's playing  ?  
 it 's the powell orchestra  .  
 do you know what they are playing  ?  
 they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program  .  
 and who is directing  ?  
can you study with the radio on  ?  
 no  i listen to background music  .

 thank you  !  my wife likes cooking very much  .  
what are you doing this weekend  ?

 i was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach  .  
 that sounds like a great idea  !  
 would you be interested in joining me  ?  
 sure  i would love to go with you  .  when would you be leaving  ?  
 i thought that we could leave around 8 
 that would give us plenty of time to explore  .  did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in santa barbara  ?  
 that was part of my plan  .  
mr  .  lee  i was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next friday night  ?  
 yes  i think we might be free  .  what did you have in mind  ?  
 i 've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home  .  
 that sounds great  .  is it casual  ?  
 actually  we thought it would be fun to have a formal sitdown dinner for the holidays  .  
 that sounds good  .  it will give my wife a chance to dress up  .  
 yes  we 've invited four other couples  so it should be a good mix of people  .  
 that sounds wonderful  .  will there be anyone there that i know  ?

 it 's very hot  the temperature is often over 40  c  .  
 do you like the weather in seattle  ?  
 not really . but i like it in spring and fall  .  i do n't like it in winter  .  
 why  ?  
 the winter is very rainy  i do n't like the rainy day  .  
 what about the weather in boston  ?  
 i lived there for three years  .  i like summer but i do n't like winter  .  
 is it very cold in winter  ?  
welcome  ron  come on in  !

 ron  have a seat and i 'll get us something to drink  .  
 good  !  i am really thirsty  .  you know it really is hot outside  !  
 i have lemonade  iced tea  and mango juice  .  
hi  i have n't seen you in a while  .  
 yes  it has been a long time  !  
 how long has it been since we last saw each other  ?  
 i think that we last saw each other two years ago  .  
 what have you been doing for the past two years  ?  
 i have been going to graduate school at usc  .  
 what are you majoring in  ?  
 i am studying international communications  .  
 you should easily be able to find a job with that major  .  
hi  linda  .  i have n't seen you for ages  .  
 yes  .  i miss you very much  .  
 so do i  .  
 have you graduated from college  ?  
i 'm so glad to meet you  .  
 how is everything going on  ?  
 fine  .  
 you look prettier than before  .  
it 's nice and bright today  is n't it  ?  
 yeah . the autumn is marvelous here  .  
 how about winter  ?  
 that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp  and the road is often icy  .  
 it 's boring  right  ?  
 sure  .  
 do you get much rain during the summer  ?  
 plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area  .  
 so you should bring an umbrella often  .  
it 's a lovely day  is n't it  ?  
 yes  the weather sure is nice today  .  
 i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch  ?  
 that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear  the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze  so it is not too hot  .  
 i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado  but i must admit  this sure is a nice spring day  .  
 hey  this spot in the shade looks really comfortable  .  
 okay . hey  is that a dark cloud over there  ?  do you think it will rain after all  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  i say the weather report last night  and it said the weather should be fine all day  .  
why are you walking to and fro in the room  ?  
 i  m worrying about the children  .  after all this is the first time they have been out without us  .  
 don  t worry  .  they are grownups  .  
what happened to nancy  ?  she is all sweetness and light today  .  
 she is going to get married  .  
 no wonder  !  who is the bridegroom  ?  
how is jim recently  ?  
 he has lost his job  and his wife died from cancer not long before  .  
how is rose now  ?  
 it  s still touch and go  .  we don  t see how she can make it  .  
what is wrong with peter  ?  he sure looks unhappy  .  
 his girlfriend dumped him  and he is tearing his heart out over her  .  
 how foolish he is  .  the girl is inviting  .  she often makes a pass at boys  .  
john's very late . do you think he 's coming  ?  
 well  it does n't seem like it . he must have forgotten  .  
what a police officer  !  
 i  ve never seem such a scene either except in films  .  
lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married  .  
 she must be a good wife  .  
 not necessarily  .  this is only what she says  not what she does  .  
i 'm going to try sky diving this weekend  .  
 i would n't do it if i were you  .  
 it 's sounds like fun  .  
 it 's very dangerous  you know  .  
 i want to try something exciting  .  
 it 's an easy way to get hurt  let me tell you  .  
 i 'll tell you all about it next monday  .  
i couldn  t believe you should crack such a joke to them  .  
 what was wrong  ?  
 you carried it too far  .  you obviously offended someone  .  
 i didn  t mean to hurt anyone  .  
i learned of the railway accident only this morning  .  
 a really dreadful accident and many people were killed  .  
 is that true  ?  
 yeah  well  i fill you in one the details later  .  
the woman was beaten again  .  why didn  t she call the police  .  
 because it was her husband who beat her  .  
 it is incredible  .  
to be a revolutionary needs great courage  !  
 he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities  .  
 galileo is one of them  .  
you seem depressed these days  .  what 's the matter  ?  
 i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now  .  
 if i can do anything for you  do n't hesitate to let me know  .  
does tom drink a lot  ?  
 yes  he does  .  he often has had one to many  .  but i advised him not to drink too much  he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table  .  
you seem to very busy these days  .  what are you doing  ?  
 i am swapped with work after 10  day holiday  .  
 where did you spend your holiday  ?  
what did the boss say to you  ?  
 he asked me to beef up in the work  .  
 yeah  .  you look so unhappy recently  .  what  s the matter  .  
my son is alway complaining that i dump on him  .  he was very rude and told me to mind my own business  .  i cannot put up with that  .  
 what does his dad say  ?  
you are blue in the face  ar n't you  ?  
 the cat has eaten my fish  i 'll kill it  .  
 but supposing your son killed like the fish  what do you think then  ?  
 i 'll beat him  .  
what did he say  ?  
 he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man  .  
 it  s too good to be true  !  if i were there  i would ask him if he himself was a successful man  .  
what do you think of doctor thompson  ?  
 i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter 's disease  .  
 how can you be so sure  ?  
 i can tell from the way he spoke to us  .  
do you think they two will get married  ?  
 yeah  you can count on it  .  
 i think so  .  yes  they get along so well  .  
 i like him  .  he 's good for her  .  
lisa  i am told you did very well in your exam  .  
 i was the only one who got a strait a in my class  .  
 congratulations on your success  .  
if you can choose  will you marry a foreigner or a chinese  ?  
 why  ?  did tom pop the question  ?  
 not yet  .  but i wonder if i can get my parents  consent  .  
 let me guess  your parents want you to marry a chinese man  right  ?  
 you are right  .  it is giving me a real headache  .  i feel like i  m between a rock and a hard place  .  
 i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex  .  
 oh  how did you deal with it  ?  
 i just let it go and continued dating with my korean boyfriend  .  but finally we broke up  .  
 oh  it  s a pity  .  what was the matter  ?  
 simple  .  we had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences  .  
 like what  ?  
 he hoped to live in the korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family  .  
 oh  i see  .  in their culture women should put family first  .  
 yes  he said it would be better for me and for the whole family  .  but i simply can not quit working  .  
 so that 's why it  s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner  .  
why did n't you tell me you had a girlfriend  ?  
 sorry  i thought you knew  .  
 but you should have told me you were in love with her  .  
 did n't i  ?  
 you know you did n't  .  
 well  i 'm telling you now  .  
 yes  but you might have told me before  .  
 i did n't think you 'd be interested  .  
 you ca n't be serious  .  how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her  ?  
 sorry  i did n't think it mattered  .  
my old man always harps on me  .  
 so does my father  .  i 'm already used to it  .  
 but i ca n't bear it  john  .  
 how dare you say that  ?  what they do is just for our good  .  
who did the stupid thing  ?  
 maybe it was dick  .  
 i do n't think so  .  dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that  .  
i love slim girls  don  t you  ?  
 not particularly  .  i like fat girls  .  
 and i like a girl with good skin  do you  ?  
 i can  t say i do  .  what i like a girl with good manners  .  
 well  yes  .  but surely you like a girl with a nice figure  .  
 yes  .  but i like a girl with a nice personality  .  
 but you like a girl to be rich  surely  ?  
nice to see you  patrick  .  
 bob  !  i hear your team won the match  .  
 yeah  .  all of us tried our best  .  
 congratulations  !  
hi  natasha  how 's life  ?  
 great  .  my family came to visit me  .  
 oh  you must be very happy  .  how many people are there in your family  ?  
 my immediate family is very large  .  it 's my mother  my father  my two older brothers  my younger sister and me  .  
 i have a small family  .  they are my parents  my younger brother and me  .  
 i thought you were the only child in the family  .  did n't china practice the onlychild policy in the early 1980s  ?  
 yes  it did  .  but my parents are ethnic minority people  .  it 's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children  .  
 interesting  .  what do you think about families with only one child  ?  
 the child must feel very longly  .  my younger brother is 10 years younger than me  .  before he was born  i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one day  .  
 do you get along well with each other  ?  
 yes  we are very close  .  he is 12 years old now and very smart  .  he always makes us laugh a lot  .  
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family  .  
jane  i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon  .  
 a friend and i are planing to go out  why  ?  what 's up  ?  
 there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum  i was hoping you d like to come with me  .

 i wish i could  but it 's my mums birthday  .

 no  .  thank you  .  i can handle it  but thanks for the offer  .  
 ok  i will see you again  .  
i hear that tom got divorced  and i don  t know how he is now  .  
 out of sight  out of mind  .  
 who do you mean  ?  
i hear that mary got mad  .  
 so i heard  .  
 what  s wrong with her  ?  
it is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control  .  
 it  s a typical of them to do so  .  
 what can we do  ?  
hi charles  i want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian  .  
 you did  ?  that is great  !  
 yeah  i am having a party this saturday night  a sort of house warming  and i want to invite you  .  are you busy  ?  
 no i am free  i will be there  what time the thing starting  ?  
 around seven  .  
 ok  great  should i bring anything  ?  
 no  but thanks for offering  actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any  ?  i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat  do you have any  ?  
 sure  i will be happy to bring a few  what is the address  ?  
 do n't worry  i will come to pick you up at about six thirty  .  
betty was in hospital  .  
 i know that  .  i met her last week  and she looked as pale as death  .  
 she suffers from cancer  .  
oh  you are out of breath  !  what  s happened  ?  
 a gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street  .  we must leave this place the soonest  .  
 that it easy . they get caught before they come here  .  
the country is strong only in appearance  .  don  t you think so  ?  
 yes  .  in fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in  .  
what does your friend jim do  ?  
 he is a teacher  but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time  .  
 he can repair cares  ?  i cannot believe it  .  
mr  .  brown  are your children always kicking up a row like this  ?  i cannot concentrate on my paper  .  
 sorry  mr  .  black  .  i  m trying to make them quiet  .  
 i  m afraid if the noise goes on  i shall have no alternative but to leave  .  
old dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day  .  
 why do you say that  ?  
 i  ve ever seen a living being looked so thin  .  
 really  ?  in my eyes it  s normal  as an old man  to be thin is better than to be fat  .  
hi  peter  .  i  m afraid i can  t make it to dinner tomorrow night  .  
 oh  why not  ?  
 it  s just i  m not feeling well  .  i think i  m coming down with a cold or something  .  
 oh  i  m sorry to hear that  .  hey  don  t worry about the dinner  .  we  ll do it some other time  .  but you take care of yourself  .  
i hear you and james are engaged at last  .  
 yes  we are  .  
 when are you getting married  ?  
 in the spring  .  
 oh  lovely . where s the wedding going to be  ?  
 well  .  .  we 're not sure yet  probably in st . albans  .  
 oh  yes  your parents live there  do n't they  ?  
 yes  that 's right  .  
 where are you going to live after you 're married  ?  
 we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london  .  
 are you going to give up your job  ?  
hi  walter  !  
 hi  sterling  !  
 what do you think of our new teacher  ?  
 professor wood  ?  i think he 's a brilliant scientist  .  
 you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded  ?  
did you bring some lunch with you  ?  
 yes  i packed it myself  .  
 wow  that looks beautiful  .  
 it 's my healthconscious lunch  good for my health and beauty  .  
hi  bob  !  how are you doing  ?  
 fine  !  how are you  ?  
 i 'm fine too  thank you  .  
 i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me  ?  i 've two complimentary tickets  .  
 with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening  ?  
 it will be held at the music hall  .  
 what 's on the program  ?  
did you go to the concert last weekend  ?  
 no  i did n't  .  and you  ?  was it good  ?  
 yes  i did  .  i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer  a violinist and a pianist  .  
 how much was the ticket  ?  
excuse me  are you miss green  ?  
 yes  .  may i help you  ?  
 may i introduce myself  ?  
 yes  .  
 i  m a new student in the school  .  my name  s john  .  
 nice to meet you  john  .  
how can i lose weight  doctor  ?  i seem to get fatter even when i just look at food  ?  
 well  jim  .  it is a combination of how much you eat  the type of food you eat  and when you eat your meals  .  
 i never eat breakfast though  .  
 that 's a big mistake  you should always have a good breakfast  .  you will not run your car without fuel  and as well you wo n't expect your body to work without food  .  
 i never thought about it that way  .  
 i bet you eat a large evening meal  then sit and watch tv or read a book  .  then instead of burning off your energy  your body stores it as fat  .  
 oh doctor  i feel so foolish  .  
 well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits  .  
how 's your new car  ?  
 perfect . couldn t be better  !  
 you made a good choice  then  ?  
 it 's just what i wanted  .  
 no regrets  ?  
 i 'm really pleased with it . thanks  .  
 i 'm glad you 're so happy  .  
what shall we do tonight  ?  
 how about the cinema  ?  
 that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages  .  
 what would you suggest to see  ?  
would you like to come by and play bridge  ?  
 well  let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change  ?  we have n't done that for a long time  .  
 well  to tell the truth  i do n't really feel like it tonight  .  i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired  .  
 hmm . well  in that case  we could go to the movies  .  
 oh  we always go to the movies . can t we do something different  ?  
 well  do you have any suggestions  ?  
 let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge  ?  
 it 's ok with me  but we do n't have any beer and things  .  
 well  shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over  and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff  .  
 ok  .  
what 's this  i wonder  ?  
 i 'm not sure . let me have a look  .  .  .  it could be a coffee grinder  .  
 a coffee grinder  ?  
 yes  it must be used for grinding coffee beans  .  
you 're not looking happy . what s the matter  ?  
 oh  nothing special  .  i 'm just a bit tired  .  
 with the job  ?  
 with everything  with everybody  with all this  !  
 a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday  .  
 it was n't always like this  you know  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 well  i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives  .  
 you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter  .  
let 's go out for a walk  .  
 i do n't really feel like a walk  .  
 well  shall we go to the cinema  ?  
what was that noise  ?  
 it was the pilot putting the wheels down . we must be coming into land . are you frightened  ?  
hello  is jack there  ?  
 speaking  .  
 jack  !  it  s rose here  .  
 hi  rose  .  how  s everything  ?  
 fine  thanks  .  i  m having several friends over for dinner this saturday  .  and i was wondering if you have the time to join us  .  
 sounds good  .  what time do you want me to come  ?  
good evening  mr  .  wu  .  
 good evening  mr  .  smith  .  
 have you met my wife  mary  ?  
 no  .  i haven  t had the pleasure  .  
 mary  this is mr  .  wu  my new chinese friend  .  
 how do you do  mr  .  wu  ?  welcome  .  
 how do you do  ?  
hello  this is helen speaking  .  
 hello  helen  .  this is john  .  how are you  ?  
 fine  thank you  .  and you  ?  
 fine  thanks  .  i  ll have a party next sunday at home  .  i  m calling to ask whether you can come or not  .  
 oh  how wonderful  .  i  ll be glad to  .  
 okay  now you are a famous star  .  
 hum  don  t say that  .  maybe you can do something useful for me  .  
 what  s wrong with you  ?  
 i  ll tell you at the party  .  
hey  jane  .  .  .  are you familiar with our company 's insurance policies  ?  
 umm  .  .  .  i think so  .  what 's up  ?  
 i 've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies  .  .  .  but it looks like i 'm going to need to make a claim  .  
 really  ?  are you ok  ?  
 i have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option  .  does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing  ?  
 if the injury is workplace related i 'm sure it 's completely covered  .  
 hummum  .  .  .  i think i 'll have to talk to the doctor again about that . anyway  .  .  .  now that i 'm going to have to make some claims  i think i 'd better try and understand how the system works  .  would you mind breaking it down for me  ?  
 sure  .  basically we have two insurance policies for employees  .  .  .  workman's compensation and medical insurance  .  the company pays the premiums for workman's compensation  and for a significant part of the medical coverage  but you pay part of that premium  too  .  
 that 's the charge for insurance i see on my pay slip each month  right  ?  
 yep  .  every country in the world has a different system  but here we buy insurance from a private provider  .  
 so workman's compensation is if i slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job  right  ?  
so  fred  what are your plans for after graduation  ?  
 well  i 've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown  .  
 that 's cool  .  have you already found an apartment to live in  ?  
 i  m planning on living with my parents  .  wo n't you  ?  
 i could n't even if i wanted to  .  my parents told me that if i went home  then i 'd have to find my own place  .  
 you mean they 're kicking you out  ?  
 not really  they just do n't want me living at home  .  my older sister did that  and she lived at home for seven years  .  once she started living at home  it got harder and harder for her to move out  .  
 well  it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life  .  they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with  but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so  .  
 my parents just did n't handle my older sister very well  and because of that  they want me to be more independent  .  they think that it 's important that i should learn how to live on my own  .  
so chris  i 've heard that you 're from a big family  .  how many people  ?  
 nine total  .  seven children and my parents  .  
 seven children  ?  that 's a lot  .  why did your parents have so many  ?  
 well  my mother came from a big family  and wanted to have one of her own  .  my father was an only child  and did n't really care about having a large family  but my mother talked him into it  .  
 jeez  seven children  .  that must have a lot of problems  .  we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right  .  
 it can be hard  and there are certain sacrifices you have to make  .  
 like what  ?  i assume that there 's no privacy  .  
 that 's one  .  another is the lack of personal property  .  everything you have  from toys to clothes  is used by your brothers and sisters  .  especially clothes  .  three quarters of my wardrobe are handmedowns  .  
 and the age gap is also annoying  .  there 's a tenyear difference between my younger brother and me  .  we have nothing in common  .  
 same problem here  .  there 's an 18  year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family  .  the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college  .  
 well  at least going to college wo n't be too bad  .  since both of your parents are college professors  they must give you reduced tuition at the college  .  
darling  i have news for you  .  bobby and his wife  evelyn  are going to have a baby soon  .  
 really  ?  i thought his wife couldn  t have a baby  .  
 actually they  re expecting the baby to come on my birthday  .  
 oh  what a coincidence  !  i bet bobby must be very happy about it  .  he likes children and always wants a child of his own  .  
 in fact  they  re both very excited about the coming baby  .  evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like  since one parent is american and the other one is chinese  .  
 oh  right  .  now i know why they would want to see our boy  .  it  s hard to imagine the wonder  !  are they expecting a boy or a girl  ?  
 it  s still a mystery  .  because evelyn is only threemonth pregnant  .  but she begins to take her maternity leave now  .  
do you have much experience with kids  ?  
 yes  .  i have three sons  .  actually i also have a grandson  .  
 to tell you the truth  sometimes i regret having a baby so early  .  i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby  .  
 i understand  .  i was in your position before  .  at that time i couldn  t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me  .  my husband seldom stayed at home  .  
 what about your mother  ?  did she help you  ?  
 yes  she did a little  .  but you see  americans are different from chinese  .  you can  t depend on your own mother to be a fulltime babysitter  .  she could babysit only once or twice a week  .  that  s it  .  i had to care for them most of the time  .  
 i see  .  so if my little family goes to america  i would end up taking care of my child all the time  .  my husband would have to make the bread for us  .  i just don  t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day  .  
 don  t worry  .  you can take night classes  .  i did that when i had kids  .  and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten  .  then you could find a job and work  .  
 sounds not so easy to me  .  when that happens  i will be too old to learn  .  
hi  anna  .  i haven  t seen you for ages  .  where have you been  ?  
 i  ve been away on holidays for sometime  .  
 no wonder i haven  t seen you recently  .  where did you spend your holidays  ?  
 i went with my husband  .  our first stop was bangkok  .  we stayed there for 5 days  .  then we flew to hong kong  stopover for 3 days  .  our last stop was china  .  we visited the great wall  .  
 you must have a wonderful time  .  
 yes  .  we enjoyed ourselves very much  .  have you traveled much  luke  ?  
 no  my wife doesn  t like traveling  .  we haven  t been traveling for more than ten years  .  the first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married  .  we spent our honeymoon in the alps  .  
how good are you at sports  bill  ?  
 are you kidding  ?  i  m terrible  !  but i love to watch sports  .  i go to football or baseball games a lot  .  and i read sports magazines every week  .  
 wow  !  
 do you like sports  janice  ?  
 oh  yes  .  i like to exercise  .  but i don  t watch sports or buy sports magazines  .  i don  t have much time to do those things  .  
 oh  i see  .  you know  we spend time doing different sports  .  how much time do you spend exercising  ?  
 well  i guess i exercise about two hours a day  .  i do aerobics three times a week  and the other days i play badminton with my husband  .  i always feel good afterward  .  
 that  s great  !  i  ve heard people say that before  .  
 well  why don  t you try to get some exercise  ?  it  s difficult  but very rewarding  .  
i can  t wait to retire  .  
 and then what  ?  
 and then i  m moving to florida where i can play golf all day  every day  !  
 that sounds boring to me  .  
 what do you plan on doing after you retire  ?  
 yes  i think i will do something new  .  i  ve always wanted to be a teacher  .  
hey  ben  .  .  .  did you catch the game last night  ?  
 uh  .  .  .  what game  ?  
 baltimore defeated texas by 17 points  !  
 um  .  .  .  and what sport are we talking about here  ?  
 football of course  !  
 oh  .  .  .  football  .  football is cool  .  i usually try to catch the world cup finals  .  
 no  i 'm talking about american football  .  the world cup is soccer  .  
 oh  i understand  .  i ca n't say i 'm a big fan  .  i 'm from china  and football does n't have a really big following over there  .  
 so chinese people prefer soccer or basketball  ?  
 yes  i think so  .  but to be perfectly honest  i 'm not really a sports nut . when i was in high school i played on the school volleyball team  .  are you a diehard football fan  ?  
 oh  certainly  .  i would n't miss a game for the world  .  my girlfriend says i have an addiction  .  and actually  if i had to choose between her and my games  .  .  .  i 'd probably pick football  .  
 it seems americans are very passionate about sports  .  is this just a part of your culture  ?  
i don  t understand why you always look so happy  so energetic  .  it seems like you  ve got good news everyday  .  
 really  ?  do i look happy all the time  ?  
 all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers  .  
 oh  do you know why  ?  actually  it  s easy  .  because i always exercise  .  my exercise  i think  is very hard  .  i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties  .  i feel alive  !  
 oh  i know  .  i saw you doing pullups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you  .  
 yeah  they are doing it for fun  .  seldom would people like my exercise  .  it  s difficult and boring  .  
 it  s true  .  many students do the exercise when they have to  .  we have p  .  e  .  once a week  .  
 but i think chinese students need to exercise more  .  besides exercise will help them learn new things better  .  don  t students want to have a good memory  ?  
 of course  .  i didn  t know that  .  i only know exercise makes bodies stronger  .  i should take some exercise then  .  do you have any suggestions  ?  
 well  do what you like to do  .  it can be anything  .  jogging  doing aerobics  going bicycling  and playing pingpong  .  absolutely anything  .  doing three or more workouts a week is good for you  .  but remember to do some stretches first  .  
that 's right  .  and i 'm going to be vice president of marketing  .  
 way to go  mary  .  a lot has happened during the last few months  has n't it  ?  
 you can say that again  !  
 what 's up with vince and elvin  ?  
 they work for zina now  .  
 and they 're happy with that  ?  
this is going to surprise you  but i 'm happy  .  i think you 're making the right move  .  
 you do  ?  
 look  maybe i should n't tell you this  but i 'v going over to webtracker  too  .  
 no way  !  that 's great  !  then we 'll still be together  !  
 actually  i 'm already working for webtracker  .  vince never wanted to give me what i was worth  so i figured  what the heck  .  
 no kidding  !  i ca n't believe this  .  you devil  !  
is that you  dave  ?  oh  my gosh  !  the backstabber who left us to work for the evil webtracker  !  
 yeah  yeah  yeah  .  hi  mary  .  how are you  ?  
 i 'm filthy rich  !  have n't you heard about the micropower deal  ?  
 yeah  i guess i did  .  they 're going to buy invoking  ?  
 that 's right  .  for seventyfive million  .  so how are you  ?  
hi  dear  do you know what the important day is today  ?  
 i don  t know  .  
 please think it over  .  
 oh  i see  .  
 come on  dear  .  i know you mustn  t forget it  .  
 it  s saturday  a great weekend  .  
 ur  you really let me down  .  
 don  t be angry with me  .  i have a bad memory  .  
 no  you haven  t  .  you just don  t care about me  .  you  re an indifferent husband  .  
 what day is it on earth  ?  
did n't joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college  ?  
 he has no sense  .  
 if i were him  i would n't brazen it out by asking my parents for money  .  
sam  we are hard up for the everyday expenses  .  when can you find a job  .  
 i 'm looking for it  but you see  the market shard for jobs  too  .  
does he know that he has already at his wits end  ?  
 i think he has realized that  .  but he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act  .  
 he might be driven up a wall  .  you should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves  .  
my son came home from three years in the navy  .  
 it was a real red letter day for you  .  
susan is going to get a divorce  .  
 how do you know that  ?  
 she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh  and she left this morning  bag and baggage  .  
hey  gucci  .  i did n't know it would be a charity show  .  you can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance  .  
 oh  i forgot to tell you this  .  the show is to collect money for children in need  .  and all the money from ticket selling will go to the red cross  .  
 that 's really a good thing  .  let 's do our part  .  
 good idea  .  
 who will sing in the show  ?  
 a lot of stars  including andy  justin  mendy  .  .  .  
 mendy  ?  are you sure  ?  i love her songs  !  
 me too  .  she is so young and talented  .  she is not only a singer but also a great composer herself  .  
 yeah  .  though she was so popular  i heard she managed to maintain a low profile  .  
 she is a real star  .  not a onetime thing  .  
 but i also heard some people did n't like her music  .  i do n't understand why  .  she is so amazing  !  
 well  i suppose people have different tastes on music  .  moreover  here stuff is really strong and creative  .  it takes time for people to accept new things  .  
 you are right  .  anyway  things will be different as the days go on  .  she can get it  .  i have faith in her  .  
 sure  .  that makes a good fan  .  do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight  ?  
 here is the programme  .  check it out yourself  !  
hey  daniel  how 's it going  ?  
 hey  daddy  today i had really a fantastic history class  .  
 wow  it 's so strange for you to say things like that  .  what had happened  ?  
 we 've learnt the story of zheg he sailing to west ocean  .  he is a real great navigator  .  
 did your teacher tell you the route he took  ?  
 yeah  he  with his fleet  came across the indian ocean  and arrived at the east coast of africa  .  
 great  do you still remember when he started his voyage  ?  
 of course  that is from 1405 to 1433  which is in ming dynasty  .  
 good  by the way  do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i 've bought for you  ?  
 not yet  you know i have a lot of homework to do  .  
 you should speed up  because the story of robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today  .  
 ok  great daddy  after supper  i 'll embark on it  .  
 that 's my boy  !  wait  daniel  when is pirates of the caribbean on  ?  
 is it about captain jack sparrow  who wants to find the treasure on the sea  ?  
 exactly  now  tell me the time  .  
hello  is it necessary to do warmup exercise  ?  i ca n't wait to dive into the water  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  every customer coming here must do the warmup exercise before getting down to swimming  .  that 's out regulation  .  
 yeah  i see  .  you are just doing your job  .  but i wanna know what the advantages it has  .  
 ok  lovely boy  .  try to be patient  .  do you know the danger of swimming without warmup  ?  
 as far as i know  people will be weak if they swim too long  .  
 that 's right  .  but the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming  .  
 is it very dangerous  ?  i 'm a little scared  .  do you offer the lifebuoy for us  ?  
 yes  besides that  we also provide our customers with goggles  swimming suit and something like that  .  
 do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen  ?  
hey  shirley  .  the party has been wonderful  .  my husband and my children have enjoyed it very much  and me too  .  
 i 've said you will enjoy your life here  !  
 i surely will  .  by the way  is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood  ?  
 oh  i 've forgotten to tell you  .  the party is held every other week  .  and every family gives their own performance each time  .  
 my children would like that  they like dancing very much  .  
 that 's good  !  
 look  !  who is that guy on the stage  ?  
 oh  my god  !  that 's my husband  benjamin  .  
 really  ?  
 he likes american idol very much  and he always imitates the contestant at home  .  i ca n't believe he got on the stage himself  .  
 he performs very well  .  he is so funny  !  
 ok  just ignore him  .  i 've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community  .  after dinner you can go there for a walk with your family  !  
 ok  that 's perfect  !  by the way  is there any playground in our neighborhood  ?  
 yes  there is one behind our building  .  and you can play tennis there  .  but if you want to play tennis there  they will change you 30 yuan per hour  .  
 ok  got it  !  thank you so much  .  you have helped me a lot  !  
hello  let me introduce myself  .  i 'm your neighbor  .  my name is shirley  .  
 hi  shirley  .  i 'm sophie  .  it 's nice to meet you  .  
 nice to meet you  too  .  
 please come in  .  
 here is a little gift for your family  .  it 's a calendar with all the community events on it  .  i hope it can be helpful  .  
 i really appreciate it  .  
 since we are neighbors  if you need any help or anything  please come to me  .  
 i will  .  actually  i am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before  .  
 oh  do n't worry about that here  .  there are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood  .  you know  they are all very strong  .  
 really  ?  that 's good  .  is there any supermarket in our neighborhood  ?  
 of course  .  there is a carrefour near the neighborhood  .  i 'll show you there if you want to  .  
 that 's terrific  !  
 by the way  a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow  .  i hope i can see you there  .  
look  !  mom  that 's amazing  !  i ca n't believe the girls have so neat movements  .  
 yeah  they all received very strict training  .  a minute on the stage takes tenyear practice  .  
 and all their movements are so elegant  .  it seems like dancing in the water  .  
 exactly  you know  water ballet puts dancing  music and swimming together  .  
 there you go  !  daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming  .  
 that 's my boy  !  katherine curtis created this activity in 1920  .  and in 1984  it was authorized as one activity in olympic games  .  
 wow  mom is more knowledgeable than dad  .  i must learn from you  .  
 my little boy  you should learn more from me  .  i 'm almost thirty years older than you  .  
 ok  you 're the boss  .  look  mom  one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool  .  
i do n't know how john can put up with his son  who fools around without working  .  
 he 's out of john's hands  .  nothing he can do about such a black sheep  .  
hi  i 'm benjamin  .  nice to meet you here  .  you look great  .  
 thank you  .  nice to meet you too  .  i 'm john  .  is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane  .  
 no  this is the second time  .  but i also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag  .  
 oh  i am sorry to hear that  .  take it easy  .  it will be ok soon  .  you see  i take this longhour plane frequently  but the jet lag still makes me uneasy  .  
 oh  that 's too bad  .  do you get a good knowledge of china  ?  
 yes  whenever i think about china  i 'd see the tian'an men square  .  china is a very beautiful country  .  and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most  .  
 all of the chinese are proud of the great wall  .  and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world  .  
 was it built before the in dynasty  ?  i thought it was in the ming dynasty  .  
 no  before the in dynasty  .  
 oh  yeah  .  thought i am an american  i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well  .  
do you like watching the winter olympic games  ?  
 of course  .  it 's the tradition game in winter  and with good reason  .  do n't you like watching it  ?  
 of course i do  .  i love it  .  all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable  .  
 that 's true  .  for various reasons  it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics  .  you know  the low temperature may cause many problems  .  
 yeah  .  what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics  ?  
 when the olympic games started in modern times  only summer events were included  .  when it grew popular  there came the winter olympic games  which includes a variety of winter sports  .  
 i see  .  then  what 's your favorite winter sport  ?  
 figure skating  .  in my eye  nothing beats it  .  
 then you must know shen due and hao hongbo  .  
 oh  i did n't expect you to know them  .  but yes  i love them not only because of many medals they 've won  but also because of many medals they 've won  but also because of their spirits  .  
excuse me  what 's the screen near your steering wheel for  ?  
 it 's a portable tv  .  it 's a popular thing now  .  
 oh  that 's new to me  .  so what 's on everyday  ?  
 news about current affairs  documentaries  music  movies  noncommercial ads and so on  .  
 is there anything interesting  ?  
 yes  there are something good and informative  .  i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education  .  
 i agree  .  are there any commercials on the tv  ?  
 of course  .  because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs  .  
 that makes a lot of sense  .  does the tv work well  ?  
 not always  .  it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals  .  
 i got it  .  do you pay for the programs  ?  
look  !  someone is celebrating his birthday  .  
 this must be his 21st birthday  .  no doubt about it  .  
 why  ?  do you know that guy  ?  
 no  .  well  in america  21 is the age when you 're allowed to drink  .  so  many guys celebrate it in bars  .  
 that 's interesting  .  but it would be really expensive  i suppose  .  just think about all the drinks  .  
 no  .  if it 's your birthday  then you do n't need to pay a cent  .  just blow out the candles and open the gifts  .  that makes the birthday a special day  .  your friends will take care of everything  .  
 wow  .  that 's wonderful  .  
 what about in china  ?  what 'd you do to celebrate your birthday  ?  
what  s the difference between football and rugby  ?  
 those tow games are quite different  .  first  there  s the size of the teams  .  in football  a team has 11 players  .  in rugby there are 15 players on each team  .  the biggest difference is that in football  only the goalkeeper can use his hands  .  in rugby  the ball is usually carried forward by players  though kicking is permitted  .  
 in rugby  players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates  don  t they  ?  
 that  s right  .  however  players can only pass the ball backwards  .  they cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates  .  that  s a foul  .  
 i know how goals are scored in football  but how about in rugby  ?  
 if a team carries the ball over the goal line  they score points  .  a team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch  .  
 there  s a lot more physical contact in rugby  isn  t there  ?  
 yes  .  players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball  .  this is called  tackling   as in football  .  
 the ball is a different shape in rugby  isn  t it  ?  
 yes  .  it  s not perfectly round like a football  .  a rugby ball is oval in shape  .  there  s a match on tv this afternoon  .  why don  t you watch it with me  ?  i  ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we  re watching  .  
hello  .  nice to see you again  .  i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery  .  i hope everything  s ok  .  
 yes  fine  .  i had something wrong with my stomach  .  i won  t go into detail  but it wasn  t serious  .  
 i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital  .  
 i think most people are a little nervous about it  .  i was really very  very nervous just before i had the operation  but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation  .  
 it must have really hurt afterwards  .  
 well  the nurse game me plenty of painkillers  but it did feel uncomfortable  .  i wasn  t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours  .  that was the worse thing  .  
 i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital  .  
 i certainly was  !  however  the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn  t eat for another 72 hours  and steak was on the list  !  
 is there any pain now  ?  
 no  not at all  .  i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days  .  
 did they take good care of you in the hospital  ?  
how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved  ?  
 i think that the public transport system could be made simpler  .  i never know where the bus routes actually go  .  the routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line  .  
 i think we just need to build more roads  .  then there would be more space for cars to drive and we  d have fewer traffic jams  .  
 if we built more roads  people would just fill them with cars again  .  i think we should discourage people from using their cars  .  
 how would you do that  ?  
 i think we should do a few things at once  .  improving public transport would encourage people to use that  .  if we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre  they won  t use their cars as much  .  
 i don  t know  .  i think it  s unfair to make drivers pay more money  .  they already pay a lot of taxpetrol tax  for example  .  
 i think that they should pay more tax  .  look at the damage they cause to the environment and people  s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes  .  
 the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city  .  the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom  .  it well be unpopular  .  
did you hear about car accident on spring road yesterday  ?  
 yes  i did  .  i heard that they took both drivers to hospital  .  one needed surgery  .  
 yes  .  i heard he had a few broken bones too  but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems  .  
 the second driver was luckier  .  he had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound  .  
 yes  .  he was released from hospital yesterday evening  .  the other man could be there for weeks  .  
 i understand that he  s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus  .  his condition can  t be very good  .  
 the hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable  .  what does that mean  ?  
 it means he  s really badly injured  but he will almost certainly survive  .  
is your city a historical place  ?  
 not rally  .  200 years ago  it was just a small insignificant village  .  
 how did it grow into such a large place  ?  
 large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here  .  the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre  .  
 as the city grew  it must have absorbed many village nearby  .  
 yes  it did  .  the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city  .  
 i see  .  are there any building more than 200 years old in your city  ?  
 oh  yes  .  several of the buildings from the villages still survive  .  many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs  .  there was a castle near one village  so our city has a castle too  .  
what  s your favourite ball sport  ?  
 i like basketball  .  i really enjoy watching the nba games on tv  .  
 who  s your favourite player  ?  
 i don  t really have one but i support huston  .  
 do they have a good team  ?  
 i think they do  but i  m biased  .  they have a good manager and a great coach  .  
 i can  t keep up with the game  .  the players play so quickly that i can hardly see what they are doing  .  
 i have the same problem  .  the players are really very skilful  .  i wish i could play that well  .  
 you play for an amateur team  don  t you  ?  
 yes  i do  .  we  re doing pretty well this season  .  we  ve won most of our games  but we  re not top of the league table  .  
 how many more games are there this season  ?  
hello  !  how are you  .  
 not too well  !  i  m just to the doctor  .  i haven  t been feeling too well over the last few days  .  
 what have you got  ?  a cough  ?  a cold  ?  
 that  s the funny thing  .  i don  t what  s wrong with me  .  i just feel exhausted  .  
 perhaps you  ve been working too hard  .  you do have a highpressure job  .  
 maybe  .  i haven  t been able to keep my food down either  .  that  s unusual  .  
 well  .  i  m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again  .  dr  .  jameson is very good  .  
 yes  he is  .  i  ve make an appointment for 10 o  clock  so i  d better move along  .  
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight  .  how about you  ?  
 yes  i 'd love to  .  it  s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good  .  
 i like watching it for the fashion  .  i like to see what the ladies are wearing  .  of course  the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo  .  
 sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours  .  which films do you think will win awards this year  ?  
 i 'm really not sure  .  usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony  but this year there are several contenders  .  
 you  re right  .  this year should be much more exciting than usual  .  what  s you favourite award category  ?  
 you might think this strange  but i like the category for  best foreign language film   .  
you  re a big fan of andy lau  aren  t you  ?  
 yes  i  ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd  .  i adore him  .  he  s my idol  .  
 how come you don  t have all of his films on dvd  ?  
 some of his early films are hard to find nowadays  especially the ones where he only played a bit part  .  
 i see  .  i  m sure you  ll find them one day  .  i see you also have several poster of him  .  
 yes  .  these posters are new  .  i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday  .  
 are you a member of his fan club  ?  
 i was  but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet  so i  m not a member now  .  
 did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month  ?  
 of course  !  i bought two copies  .  
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life  .  they have lots of money  so they can buy almost anything they want  .  they  re famous  so everyone loves them  .  
 i think they must have horrible lives  .  all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do  .  they must get sick of it  .  
 i bet they love it really  .  sure  they complain about it  but that just gets them more publicity  doesn  t it  ?  
 i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves  .  they only want it for their films  .  
 no way  !  they want publicity for themselves  so that they get invited to make more films  go to lots of cocktail parties  and even make albums  !  they have such an easy life  .  they don  t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party  .  
 show biz stars have plenty of expenses  .  that  s why they need so much money  .  they need million of dollars to buy big  seclude houses and wonderful dresses  .  i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a tshirt  but they can  t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don  t like  .  
 i don  t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars  .  they  re overpaid  overambitious  and overadored  .  
 i think you should give them some credit  .  they  re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn  .  they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves  .  
i just love your hair that way  .  
 thanks  .  
 where did you have it done  ?  
 my sister did it  .  when did you get yours cut  ?  
 just yesterday  .  i 'm still getting used to it  .  
 well  it looks very nice  .  
hello  kith  can you and alice come around this evening  ?  we prefer your coming  .  
 i think we would be able to make it  .  what time shall we come  ?  
 about 7 o 'clock  .  
 shall we bring any thing  ?  some wine  ?  
it 's terrible how things have changed  .  you remember there used to be trees on all these hills  .  
 really  ?  there are n't many left now  .  
 no  they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away  .  
 were there any animals in the forest  ?  
the johnson are on their way back  .  you remember them  do n't you  ?  
 johnson  ?  i ca n't place them  .  
 we met them in bermuda last may  .  
 they 've completely slipped my mind  .  
 the couple with the dogsthink back  .  
 no  i do n't recall a thing about them  .  
 well  i 've invited them for brunch  .  
what 's the matter with you  then  ?  you look miserable  .  
 it 's us  .  
 what do you mean by  us   ?  
 well  we used to talk to each other before we were married  .  remember  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  we re talking now  are n't we  ?  
 oh  yes  but we used to do so much together  .  
 yes  .  i remember  .  but we never used to argue  .  you used to think i was wonderful  .  where are you going  ?  
i went to the doctor yesterday  .  
 i beg your pardon  ?  
 i said i had been to the doctor the day before  .  
 what did he say  ?  
 he said i d got the flu  .  
 oh dear  !  what did he tell you to do  ?  
 he told me to stay in bed for ten days  .  
 ten days  ?  would you please repeat it again  ?  
hot in here  is n't it  ?  
 yeah  really  .  
 is it ok if i sit here  ?  
 of course  .  suit yourself  .  
 thanks  .  my name 's bill peters  by the way  .  
 hi  i 'm susan jackson  .  
 nice to meet you  .  and what do you do  susan  ?  
 i 'm a student at ucla  .

 yes  i want to be a doctor one of these days  .  what about you  ?  
 i 'm an engineer  i work for boeing  .  say  would you like a drink  ?  
could you tell me what university you want to go to  john  ?  
 pardon  ?  
 what university would you enter  ?  
 university  ?  why  ?  you asked me last year  .  
 oh  i forget  .  sorry  .  
 i went to harvard university  .  
 did you  ?  and what course did you take there  ?  
 god save me  !  is there anything wrong with you  ?  did n't i tell you  ?

 i did a b  .  a  .  in economics  .  remember  ?  
what dressing would you like on the salad  ?  
 french dressing  please  .  
 i beg your pardon  ?  
 oh  french dressing  .  
 sorry  it 's not available now  .  anything else  ?  
 we still prefer french dressing  .  
 will you say it again  ?  
would you mind taking your feet off the table  mike  ?  
 not at all  .  but i 've found satisfaction in it  !  
 do you put your feet on your own table  ?  
 no  i never do that  .  
 why not  ?  
 i do n't want to mark my table  of course  .  
 well  will you please put them down  ?  
 i 'm sorry  .  i thought you would n't come back so early  .  
 i forgot something on the table  .

 listen  i 'd better get back to the grindstone  .  
oh dear  miss  you are soaked  !  wow  it 's really raining heavily outside  .  
 yes  it sure is  .  i had to run here from work  !  i need to rush as i 'm on my lunch break  .  
 well please  why do n't you go ahead of me in line  ?  i 'm in no hurry  .  
 oh  that 's so nice of you  !  thank you very much  .  
 my pleasure miss  .  actually  could you recommend what to eat here  ?  i 've never been here before  .  
 sure  .  well  the avocado sandwich is delicious  and it 's the healthiest thing on the menu  .  personally  i think the beef salad is the tastiest choice  .  i usually get that  .  also  the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town  !  
 well  thanks for the suggestions  .  
i ca n't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard i try and i have been here for 2 years already  !  
 well  have you thought of getting an mba  ?  i heard it does wonders in getting you to the top  .  
 an mba  hey  .   .   .  well my degree was n't in business  the business schools wo n't be interested in me  .  
 nonsense  !  the business schools measure your ability through a test called gmat  .  
 gmat  ?  what does that stand for and what will the test contain  ?  
 graduate management admission test  it contains three parts 
 okay  this sounds a little tough  how am i supposed to practice for this  ?  
 up to you  you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions  you can also use free or private computer software  .  going to church might help as well  !  
 no matter what i do  i 'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat  !  
hi  michelle  .  do you need to use the photocopier  ?

you want to go to the movies tonight  ?  
 sure  !  what s playing  ?  
 the new twilight movie  !  
 twilight  ?  as in the vampire movies  ?  no way  i am watching that  but i don t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires  .  it doesn t make sense  .  
 of course it does  .  it s like a modern tale of romeo and juliet  .  you can see a couple who are in love but can t be together because they are so different  .  and in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it  !  plus the cast is hip  young people that make the movie even more enticing  .  
i have made up my mind  .  i am getting a tattoo  .  
 really  ?  are you sure  ?  
 yeah  !  why not  ?  they are trendy and look great  !  i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back  .  
 yeah but  it is something that you will have forever  !  they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment  .  on top of all that  i have heard it hurts a lot  !  
 really  ?  
 of course  !  they use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink  .  
 oh  i didn  t know that  !  i thought they just paint it on your skin or something  .  
 i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos  .  also  find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles  and that the place is hygienic  .  
are you excited about your trip next month  ?  
 yes and no  .  i can t wait to go to europe  but at the same time i am terrified  .  
 why  ?  
 well  i have acrophobia  .  i have a chronic fear of flying  .  
 oh really  ?  i have an uncle who is also terrified of flying  .  it s not that bad though  i mean  it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour  .  i actually have arachnophobia  .  
 you re scared of spiders  ?  i actually have two more phobias  .  acrophobia and glossophobia  .  
 i guess that explains why you are afraid of flying  but public speaking is not that bad  .  
 are you kidding  ?  when i get on stage  my palms start to sweat  i get really nervous and i can hardly speak  .  
 well  i must confess i am a bit claustrophobic  .  i hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds  .  
the air conditioning is not working  !  we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here  !  
 dan is on top of that  .  i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up  .  
 that would be convenient  .  they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring  .  the circuit breakers keep going out all the time  .  it  s really annoying  !  
 yeah you are right  .  this office is falling apart  !  frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that  s why the parking lot was flooded  .  
hey nick  what are you up to  ?  
 not much  just heading over to the shooting range  .  you wanna come  ?  
 seriously  ?  you mean to fire a real weapon  ?  i don  t know man  .  
 yeah  it will be fun  !  i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot  .  i also have a revolver that  s really fun too  !  they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim  .  
 yeah that would be cool  !  maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun  !  maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile  !  or what about a flame thrower  !  
 whoa  take it easy there rambo  .  don  t get carried away  .  these weapons are not toys  and you must first learn how to handle them properly  .  there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe  .  for example  never handle a weapon that you haven  t inspected yourself  .  always make sure there isn  t anything in the chamber  and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot  !  
 wow  i didn  t know  !  it always looks so cool and easy in the movies  !  
 the reality is different you know  running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies  !  so are you ready  ?  
how are the children doing at sport  ?  
 i  m very pleased with their performances  .  timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds  .  that  s very fast for a kid his age  .  
 he  s not very good at the long jump though  is he  ?  
 he  s not bad  .  he can jump a distance of over four meters  .  i think he just prefers running to jumping  .  jimmy  s very good at the high jump  .  he can jump over two meters  .  again  that  s fine for someone his age  .  
 two meters  ?  that means that the high jump bar is above his head  !  are any of them good at longdistance running  ?  
 the longest race we run is the 1500 meters  .  a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes  .  
 how are they at swimming  ?  
 they  re ok  .  i ask them to swim 500 meters each day  .  that  s 20 lengths of the swimming pool  .  they  re not very fast  but that  s ok  .  i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape  .  
 kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters  .  
 i  d be afraid to jump from that height  !  
 i think that these kinds haven  t learnt to be afraid yet  .  she started diving from a lower height  but she soon wanted to go higher  .  
hi  meally  do you know that guy over there  ?  
 the tall one  ?  sure  that 's drive  he works with lily  .  
 he is cute  .  what dose he do  ?  
 i 'm not sure  he is a manager i think  .  
 really  ?  are you going to introduce us  ?  
helen  did you hear i  m having a party  ?  next saturday in my place  .  
 i may have something on that day  but thanks for inviting me  .  
 well  drop by if you can  .  
 i will  do you want me to bring anything  ?  
lodge  you must come around sometime  you have to check out my mew stereo  .  
 sure  when is good time for you  ?  
 can you make it on tuesday  ?  
 what time do you want me there  ?  
 anytime after six will be fine  .  
do you mind if i come over to use your computer  ?  
 no  but i have to type my paper tonight  .  
 does that mean i ca n't use it tonight  ?  
hi  mark  did you catch the game last night  ?  
 no  i was out  .  was it worth watching  ?  
 you didn  t hear  ?  spain won  two to zero  .  
 oh  really  ?  so  spain is through to the next round  ?  
i 'm afraid i ca n't go to the pictures with you tomorrow  .  
 busy with your work again  ?  
 not really  .  i 'm expected to attend a meeting  .  
do you like snakes  ?  
 of course not  .  i 'm afraid of them  .  
 i mean  do you like snake meat  ?  
it is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight  .  
 really  ?  
 yes  .  so you 'd better dress warmly before you go out  .  
i must be going now  .  
 really  ?  ca n't you stay a little longer  ?  
 no  i really must go now . my family are expecting me home soon  .  
 be seeing you then  !  
i feel confused by all the diet options out there  .  i don  t know which one actually works  .  
 most of them are not so practical  .  it will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended  .  i think making an exercise plan can be more effective  .  
 maybe you  re right  .  it is very expensive to go to a weightloss center  .  i  d better join in a fitness club  .  
 you don  t need to lose weight  you are not fat  .  
have you ever played making  ?  
 not really  but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game  .  
 yes  some friends play it all day  all night  and sometimes a whole weekend  .  i tried to read about some basic rules online  but it is hard to understand  .  so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused  .  i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing  .  practice makes the master  .  
 typical francis  whether you are at work  or engaged in leisure time activities  you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself  .  
he 's honest  hardworking and responsible  .  i simply ca n't find any shortcoming of his as an employee  .  
 i rather doubt it . you re cheated by his appearance  i think  .  
many people say it 's a good story . but i think it 's boring  !  
would you like to go skiing with me  ?  i heard the new ski area is great  .  they have safe tracks  especially for the beginners and provide free training  .  i think it suits you best  .  
 sounds not bad  !  you know  the only thing i worried about is the safety  .  i  m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport  .  
 well  then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first  .  there  re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise  .  
 i will think about it  .  
japanese is easy to learn  .  
 you 're mistaken about it  .  as a matter of fact  it 's very hard  .  
 i do n't think so . there re so many familiar characters and they sound just like chinese  .  
i am not sure what to do during the holidays  any suggestions  ?  
 well  going to a cinema  visiting the galleries  exhibitions and museums  finding and meeting old friends  exercising in the health club or mountain biking  .  there are so many good choices  .  
 the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun  .  i just don  t know what to do first  .  
 why not start with the most interesting one  ?  
 actually  i  m interested in all of them  .  the more choices we have  the harder to make a decision  .  
it 's not good for business recently  .  
 not good for business  ?  i do n't see eye to eye with you . the new policy offers new opportunities  .  
which is more interesting to you  flying kites or going rollerskating  ?  
 well  flying kites is more fun to me  .  
 i 've got no kite  .  do you have one  ?  
have you got any plans for the coming holiday  ?  
 yes  i have a very special one  .  i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks  .  a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers  .  i was very interested  .  so i asked him to get me the application form  .  lucky  my application was approved by the manager very soon  .  
 volunteer in a zoo  ?  what specific things will you do  ?  
 i will help to prepare food  feed animals and clean up  .  i  m very excited about it now  .  
 it must be a unique experience  .  i  m looking forward to share your story when you come back  .  
come in  come in  !  
 hi  gary  what happened  ?  i was waiting for you at the theater  .  why didn  t you meet me there  ?  
 i thought we were supposed to meet here  .  
 don  t you know our movie starts at seven  ?  and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven  .  then it doesn  t make sense to meet at the apartment  .  
 i  m sorry  .  we must have misunderstood each other  .  
 why don  t you try to be clearer about your intentions  ?  
 you  re right  .  i am sorry  .  let  s go and watch the movie  .  
darling  i have news for you  .  bobby and his wife  evelyn  are going to have a baby soon  .  
 really  ?  i thought his wife couldn  t have a baby  .  
 actually they  re expecting the baby to come on my birthday  .  
 oh  what a coincidence  !  i bet bobby must be very happy about it  .  he likes children and always wants a child of his own  .  
 in fact  they  re both very excited about the coming baby  .  evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like  since one parent is american and the other one is chinese  .  
 oh  right  .  now i know why they would want to see our boy  .  it  s hard to imagine the wonder  !  are they expecting a boy or a girl  ?  
 it  s still a mystery  .  because evelyn is only threemonth pregnant  .  but she begins to take her maternity leave now  .  
so chris  i 've heard that you 're from a big family  .  how many people  ?  
 nine total  .  seven children and my parents  .  
 seven children  ?  that 's a lot  .  why did your parents have so many  ?  
 well  my mother came from a big family  and wanted to have one of her own  .  my father was an only child  and did n't really care about having a large family  but my mother talked him into it  .  
 jeez  seven children  .  that must have a lot of problems  .  we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right  .  
 it can be hard  and there are certain sacrifices you have to make  .  
 like what  ?  i assume that there 's no privacy  .  
 that 's one  .  another is the lack of personal property  .  everything you have  from toys to clothes  is used by your brothers and sisters  .  especially clothes  .  three quarters of my wardrobe are handmedowns  .  
 and the age gap is also annoying  .  there 's a tenyear difference between my younger brother and me  .  we have nothing in common  .  
thanks for offering to give me a lift  .  i  m looking forward to this party  but i didn  t want to go alone  .  
 don  t mention it  .  it  s my pleasure  .  have you been to one of these large  sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven  ?  
 no  this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale  s home  .  i took a taxi because i didn  t want to be late . but i was the first one 
 cookouts often start slowly  .  a two o  clock start means you arrive any time after two  .  
 thanks for telling me this  .  
 i was late getting back from the mall  but i  m hurrying  .  
 why are you in such a hurry  ?  they said  dinner at eight  and it  s only sevenfifteen  .  i don  t want to be the first one there again  .  
merry christmas  !  
 huh  ?  
 i said merry christmas  !  don  t you know that christmas is almost here  ?  
 it is  ?  oh  that  s nice  .  
 huh  ?  didn  t you know  ?  aren  t you excited  ?  
 actually  i  d forgotten about it  .  
 forgotten about it  ?  how could you  ?  
 because i  m not christian  i  m jewish  .  
 oh  i  m sorry  .  i didn  t know  .  
 it  s all right  .  there are so many christians in america that everybody takes it for granted that i  m christian  .  
 i guess so  .  so what do you do around this time of year  ?  
 well  i  ll celebrate hanukah soon  but that  s not as important to us as christmas is to you  .  mainly i  ll just enjoy the holiday break  .  
 well  would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house  ?  
thank you for showing me your offices  mr  .  becker  .  i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs  .  
 why do you say that  ?  
 the city is beautiful  the off  .  .  .   the offices are modern and comfortable  and the work is so interesting  .  
 many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives  .  government service can be a rewarding and secure career  .  
 do you mean financially rewarding  ?  
 well  many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries  .  
 i  ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy  .  
 sometimes that  s true  but not usually  .  most feds are honest  hardworking professionals  .  it  s hard to keep highly trained people  so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive  .  
 how much do you make  ?  
hi  anna  .  i haven  t seen you for ages  .  where have you been  ?  
 i  ve been away on holidays for sometime  .  
 no wonder i haven  t seen you recently  .  where did you spend your holidays  ?  
 i went with my husband  .  our first stop was bangkok  .  we stayed there for 5 days  .  then we flew to hong kong  stopover for 3 days  .  our last stop was china  .  we visited the great wall  .  
 you must have a wonderful time  .  
 yes  .  we enjoyed ourselves very much  .  have you traveled much  luke  ?  
hi  my name is ted  what  s yours  ?  
 what  ?  
 i said  i  m ted  who are you  ?  
 huh  ?  oh  my name is laura  .  
 do you somewhere often  laura  ?  
 huh  ?  i can  t hear you  the music  s too loud  .  
 let  s go outside and talk  .  so laura  do you come here often  ?  
 hold on  my ears are still ringing from the music  .  .  .  what was it you asked me  ?  
 i asked if you come here often  .  
 sometimes  usually once every few weeks  .  do you  ?  
 no  this is my first time here  .  
 i usually come with a group of friends  .  we dance a little  have a few drinks  and just have a good time  .  
 yeah  that  s why i  m here  .  my friends dragged me here  because they think i spend too much time studying  .  
 that  s good  .  it  s good to hit the books  but you need to get out once in a while  .  
anita  i  ve been here only three days and you  re leaving already  .  
 just for a few weeks  .  i need this vacation  .  you  ll be all right  .  you know the project we  re working on  and you  re a good scientist  .  don  t worry  .  i  ll be back as soon as i spend or gamble all my money  .  
 gambling  ?  where  ?  
 las vegas  .  i find gambling relaxing  .  i don  t take it seriously  the way some people do  .  besides  i love the shows and the allnight atmosphere of the town  .  the casinos never close  you know  .  
do you have much experience with kids  ?  
 yes  .  i have three sons  .  actually i also have a grandson  .  
 to tell you the truth  sometimes i regret having a baby so early  .  i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby  .  
 i understand  .  i was in your position before  .  at that time i couldn  t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me  .  my husband seldom stayed at home  .  
 what about your mother  ?  did she help you  ?  
 yes  she did a little  .  but you see  americans are different from chinese  .  you can  t depend on your own mother to be a fulltime babysitter  .  she could babysit only once or twice a week  .  that  s it  .  i had to care for them most of the time  .  
 i see  .  so if my little family goes to america  i would end up taking care of my child all the time  .  my husband would have to make the bread for us  .  i just don  t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day  .  
 don  t worry  .  you can take night classes  .  i did that when i had kids  .  and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten  .  then you could find a job and work  .  
 sounds not so easy to me  .  when that happens  i will be too old to learn  .  
daddy  i want to buy a tenspeedsportsman  .  
 how much is it  ?  is three hundred dollars enough  ?  
 no  i 'm not asking for money  .  i 'm asking for your advice  .  
is your father in the habit of having naps  ?  
 yes  all of us have naps  .  
 do n't you feel dizzy when you have to get up  ?  
i want to go to china for sightseeing . what do you think of it  mum  ?  
 why not  ?  china is a wonderful country  .  
 will you go with me  too  ?  
charles  have you finished your homework  ?  
 not yet  grandma  what 's the matter  ?  
 i want you to have a walk with me  .  
what do you know about julia roberts  ?  
 her acting is ok  .  
 i mean her personality  .  
whose part do you think is best played  ?  
 that of the old man  .  
 you 're absolutely right  !  that 's the very figure i like best  .  
how do you like other films starring charlie chaplin  ?  
 well  i like others very much  but i really do n't think much of this one  .  
 you do n't like the performance  do you  ?  
did you enjoy the movie  ?  
 oh  it 's really a drag  .  
 sorry to hear that  .  i think it 's even better than on the golden pond  .  
a new film is on . have you ever seen it  ?  
 what kind of movie is it  ?  
 it 's a feature film  .  
i 've had enough of that  !  
 why  this is the most interesting film  !  
 i hate the hero . he s too cruel  .  
did you sign up for the picnic party  ?  
 yes  of course  .  i love the picnic party  .  it  s really family fun time  .  
 this time you can bring your daughter with you  .  
 right  she is so excited and simply can  t wait  .  
have you ever been to xi  an  ?  
 yes  i  ve been there several times on business trips  .  but i have never really seen the terracotta warriors as it is outside the city  .  
 i  ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring  .  i really want to see the old walls and terracotta warriors one day  .  of course i won  t miss the local food either  .  you know  the sites interests a food in scenery  food is a key factor when visiting a place  .  
 i agree  .  as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects  .  that is frightening  .  
 sure it is  .  is it convenient to get there by plane  ?  
i wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments  .  they are working very hard these days  .  maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little  .  
 that is a good idea  i love it  .  what time do you think is convenient  ?  
 well  what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting  ?  
 ok  i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch  .  it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time  .  i am sure they don  t want to miss it  .  
lucy  what are your priorities when buying a car  ?  
 i guess the first thing is the price  the second is the size  and of course the color will play a role too  .  but i have to be honest  .  it is our today  s responsibility to take care about our environment  .  therefore  i will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car  .  you know  the rise in gasoline prices is huge  .  so i would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine  .  for which i can also save some tax  .  last of the list  i also consider the safety  .  
 what about the environmental factors  ?  
 well  i do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn  t cost much  .  some environmentallyfriendly cars are really expensive  .  
who wants to go first  ?  allen  ?  
 uh  .  .  .  i mostly just like to listen  .  you 're the groom  .  why do n't you go first  ?  
 ok  .  put on something by the backstreet boys  !  
 how about as long as you love me  !  you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke  !  
let  s call it a day  .  
 it  s nice to go home earlier once in a while  .  but it  s the evening rush  .  
 it  s hard to commute a long way  .  
how are you feeling  champ  ?  ready to go  ?  
 you know  if i can keep up my workouts  i think i have a chance in 2004  .  
 in what  ?  
 in gymnastics  .  i 'm pretty flexible  .  look  !  i can even touch my toes  !  
 can you do the vault  ?  
did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better  ?  
 are you sure  ?  how do you know  ?  
 well  usually people think i 'm a terrible singer  but after we all have a few beers  they say i sound a lot better  !  
here we are  ryan  !  this is where we 're going to celebrate  !  
 it 's a etv palace  !  i 'm glad i brought my platinum card  .  
 you wo n't need it  .  stanley  my best man  is going to treat everybody  !  
 where is stanley  ?  it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv  was n't it  ?  
 if it were up to stanley  we 'd have the wedding in the etv  !  he loves to sing  .  
 then i bet he 's really good  !  
i do n't know  .  i think you might be over the hill  .  
 well  if not gymnastics  then mountain biking  .  
 mountain biking is an olympic sport  ?  
the whether in beijing is just beautiful  .  
 autumn is the best season in beijing you know  ?  
 yes  .  i can see  .  the summer heat is over  .  and the winter cold is still far away  .  
 what is the whether like in washington at this time of this year  ?  
 autumn is also very nice in washington  .  
 is it very cold in winter there  ?  
 no  .  it isn  t  .  but sometimes it slows a lot in winter  .  
 does it rain a lot in summer there  ?  
 oh  .  yes  .  sometimes it rains very heavily 
 how about here in beijing  ?  
 there  s a lot of rain in summer  .  but it seldom rains in autumn 
 i feel it  s rather dry here 
 that  s true  .  many people from the south don  t like the whether here  .  
 are you from south  ?  
 no  .  i  m from the north  .  i was born in beijing actually  .  
guess  what i  ve bought for you  .  
 oh  .  it  s a case flowers  .  it  s very kind of you  .  
 i hope you like it  .  
 i love flowers you know  .  thank you very much  .  
how nice it is here 
 you can say that again  .  the sunny shining and there  s pleasant raise  .  it  s so lovely 
 i  ve heard the whether here is ideal  just like spring most of the year 
i  d better be going  .  
 so soon  .  why don  t you stay a little longer  ?  
 i wish i could  but it  s already late  .  
 oh  .  it  s pity you have to leave  .  
 thank you for wonderful meat  .  
merry christmas  !  
 the same to you  !  
 are you doing anything special  ?  
 we 're having some friends over . what are you doing  ?  
how about going swimming  ?  
 ok  .  where should we go  ?  
 why don  t we down to the pool  ?  it  s not too far from here  .  
have a nice weekend  !  
 thanks . you too  !  
 do you have any plans  ?  
 well  my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you  ?  
please excuse me  but i really have to be going  .  
 yes  of course . it was nice to see you  .  
where did you go yesterday  ?  
 i went to play tennis in the public park  .  
 how often do you play tennis  ?  
 twice a week  .  how about you  ?  
 i seldom play tennis  .  i prefer football and basketball  .  
 what is very difficult to gather team player together  .  
 i usually play with my schoolmates  .  
 do you like watching football matches  ?  
what  s the matter  bob  ?  
 i think it  s my ankle  .  
 what happened  ?  
 one of my snowshoes that cause on rocks  .  
 can you stand  ?  
 i don  t think so  .  it  s kind of sore  .  
 what i have to give you a hospital for an extreat  .  
 it  s that really necessary  ?  
i hear jean married a business tycoon  .  
 that 's true  .  her husband is a fat cat  .  
 but i do n't think she really loves him  .  
 she is only after his money  .  
 if i were her  i would n't marry a man i do n't really love  .  
the blacks got divorced  .  
 really  ?  why  ?  
 mr  .  black has been getting a little on the side  .  
 really  ?  i am surprised  .  he does n't look like a guy who 'd ever cheat on his wife  does he  ?  
 no  he does n't  .  anyway  his wife found out that he has been twotiming for a long time  .  
 well  i am really surprised  .  by the way  have you done anything behind my back  ?  
 no  .  the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zipping you up  .  
hi  mike  .  we 're having a party tonight  wanna come join us  ?  you can bring your girlfriend  .  
 well  .  i am breaking up with cathy  .  
 what happened  ?  did you have a fight  ?  
 no  .  she is really a very nice girl  .  .  .  
 yeah  she is  .  she is pretty  caring  getting easygoing and she is a great cook  .  she is a gem  .  
 well  you are right  .  but sometimes she is too caring  .  well  no  .  .  .  she  s just possessive and i kind of want a break  .  .  .  you know  .  .  .  for some room for myself  .  
 oh  ?   !  did you talk with her about it  ?  
 i 've tried  but it did n't work  .  
 so  when are you going to tell her  ?  
 maybe tonight  .  i do n't know  .  i do n't know how to tell her  .  
 i know she  s head over heels in love with you  .  she will be badly hurt  !  
hi  is that david  ?  
 hi  jenny  .  it 's david here  .  
 hey  what 's new  ?  
 not much  .  my girlfriend just dumped me  .  
 sorry to hear that  .  what happened  ?  
 well  she told me things just weren  t working out and we weren  t right together  .  but i thought things were just great  .  why did she say this  ?  it 's completely out of the blue  .  
 hey  that  s not the girl with pink hair  is it  ?  the girl i saw with jack yesterday  .  
 what  ?  she was cheating on me with that ugly guy  .  oh  no  i feel like such a loser  .  
 hey  she is not worth it  .  forget her  .  
 but she lied to me  .  
 hey  she is not worth it  .  anyway  there are plenty more fish in the sea  .  listen  let 's go for a drink in the town  .  how about that  ?  
 ok  then  .  
 but you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face  .  
 what face  ?  
 the one where you look like your dog just died  .  you have to get over her and the sooner the better  .  
are you coming to the bridal shower for jane  ?  
 yes  i am  .  when is the wedding  ?  
 aug 8  .  
 august bride  .  how nice  !  by the way  who is going to be the matron of honor  ?  
 mrs  .  white  .  
 oh  yeah  ?  i wonder who is going to give jane away at the wedding  .  you know her father passed away several years ago  .  
 maybe her uncle will  .  
 i think so  .  the wedding will be held at her church  right  ?  
 right  .  red rochester will officiate at the wedding  .  
 do you know where they will go on their honeymoon  ?  
i heard you are going out with john  ?  
 yes  .  to be frank  i really love him to death  .  
 you are so lucky  .  
 why do you say that  ?  
 why  ?  are you kidding me  ?  a guy like that is hard to find  .  few boys are so caring  so patient  and did i mention he is hottie  ?  
 you really think so  ?  
 totally  .  i am saying it from the bottom of my heart  !  and it 's obvious that he  s head over heels in love with you  too  .  
hey  jenny  .  would you like to go to dinner with me  ?  
 i do n't know  .  you know what they say about office romances  .  
 no  i do n't  .  what do they say about office romances  ?  
 they say you should n't mix love and work  .  
 that 's silly  .  what i do on my own time is no one else  s business  .  besides  it 's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here  .  
 you  ve got a point  .  once i dated one of my supervisors and all of my coworkers accused him of favoritism  .  then when the relationship went bad  he fired me  .  
 people fall in love with people they work with  .  that 's a fact  .  
 that may be true  but i do n't want an interoffice relationship to affect my productivity  .  
 if it does  it will only make you more productive  because we can support each other  .  
 you are sounding like we are already married  .  
 good grief  .  all i did was ask you out  .  i am sorry  .  
 well  i do n't feel right about it  .  
 i am talking about dinner tonight  not a lifetime  .  
 most starts with dinner  but then it gets out of hand  .  besides  have n't you asked out every woman in the entire office  ?  
 i like company  .  
 company  ?  i heard about you from linda  .  she said you were an octopus  !  
 what can i say  ?  i am a passionate guy  .  
 well  i hope you can find something else to be passionate about  .  
 you want to go out with me and you know it  .  
 in your dreams  .  now if you do n't mind  i 've got some work to do  .  
i 'd like to meet you again sometime  .  
 that would be great  .  actually  can i get your phone number  ella  ?  that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime  .  
 anytime  .  you can reach me at 5558929  .  
 ok  got it  .  i will call you sometime next week  .  
 fine  .  
 it 's time to go  .  bye  ella  .  hope to see you soon  .  
i hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian  .  
 thank you  .  
 where is she going to college  ?  
 she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship  .  
 really  ?  that 's the icing on the cake  .  congratulation again  !  
why do you look so gloomy  ?  what are you looking for  ?  
 my dissertation  .  i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now  .  
 did you finish typing yesterday  ?  
 yes  i kept on typing it until midnight  but it is lost  .  
 do n't worry about it  .  it must be somewhere in your room  .  let 's see where you put it  .  have you searched your drawers and the desk  ?  
 yes  but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk  .  
 how about the shelf  ?  
 i 've searched everywhere  .  where on earth did i put it  ?  
 do n't get upset over it  .  at least you have another week to go  .  
 i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another  .  just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing  .  how could i do such a thing  ?  
 cheer up  !  what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week  .  there is no need to write a new one  .  oh  what 's this  ?  is this your dissertation  ?  
 let me see  .  yes  that 's it  .  where did you find it  ?  
 you  ve put it among these journals  .  
hey  mary  nice to see you again  .  i heard you 're going back home to the u  .  s  .  
 yes  .  i 'm leaving tomorrow  .  i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you  .  
 you 're so thoughtful  .  wish you a good trip home  .  and we 'll miss you  .  
have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the south  ?  
 yes  .  i 've got to cancel my traveling plan  .  
 what a pity  !  i know you 've been longing for it these months  .  
would you like to go to the natural history museum with me  ?  
 have you ever been to it before  ?  
 yes  lots of time  .  i was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have  .  
do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone  .  
 i heard about that  .  it was successful  .  
 it 's a big jump in science  .  maybe more like a leap  .  
i ca n't decide what i should do  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 should i date tom or should i date harry  ?  
do you like to dance  ?  
 sometimes  if there 's music playing  .  
 what kind of dancing do you like  ?  
do you really have to work today  ?  
 yes  .  i 'm afraid so  .  
 but you 'll miss out on the football game  .  
so did you get in touch with your brother  ?  
 no  not yet  .  i 'm really worried  .  
 well  it 'd be foolish to call the police  .  he probably just went away overnight  .  
how about a game of tennis  ?  
 okay  .  loser has to take out the trash for a month  .  
 it 's a deal  .  
here 's 30 yuan for my ticket  .  
 keep it  .  i 'm buying tonight  .  
 no  you ca n't do that  .  
hello baseball fans  and welcome back to today  s game  !  my name is rick fields and of course  i am here  once again  with the man that seals the deal  bob copeland  .  
 it  s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions  .  
 well  the national anthem has just been sung  and the umpire has started the game  .  it  s time to play ball  !  
 roger vargas is up at bat  .  the pitcher winds up and strike one  !  
 a very nice curve ball by the pitcher  .  the catcher gives him the sign  he winds up and vargas gets a line drive  !  
 the players are scrambling to get the ball  .  vargas gets to first base and he  s still going  !  the outfielder throws it to second  !  vargas slides  !  he  s safe  !  
 great play  !  
 we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi  !  there  s the pitch  he hits it  !  it  s going  going  that ball is gone  !  
hey  ted  .  what are you up to this friday  ?  
 well  i have the day off from work  .  
 that  s great  !  do you have any plans  ?  
 well  i  ve been working so hard lately  so i  ll probably just take it easy  .  
 sounds nice  .  
 yeah  i  ll probably just stay in and relax  .  maybe watch a few movies  .  
 can i stop by  ?  
we have to pick up conrad before the party  .  
 alright  no problem  .  
 we 're supposed to meet him at cal 's bar at 10 
 wait a minute  .  cal 's bar  ?  
 yes  .  
 that 's a gay bar  .  
 yes  it is  .  conrad is gay  .  did n't you know  ?  
 i thought he was maybe gay  but i was n't sure . anyhow  you do n't expect me to go into a gay bar  do you  ?  
 why not  ?  we 're supposed to meet him there  .  
 why does n't he meet us outside  ?  
 why should he do that  ?  it is n't illegal for us to go in  .  
 yeah  but who wants to go in  ?  i 'm not gay  you know  .  why should i go in a gay bar  ?  
 you sound like you 're afraid  .  
 i just would n't be comfortable  .  
 you 've never been in a gay bar before  ?  
 no  never  .  
 but it 's just a bar  .  there 's no danger . you should n't be so homophobic  .  
 well  .  .  .  
 listen  .  if you refuse to go in  conrad will be offended . you do n't hate gay people  do you  ?  
 no  i do n't  .  but i never went into a gay bar before  .  
 do n't worry about it  .  there is nothing strange about it . if conrad 's there  we 'll leave for the party . if he 's not  we 'll sit down and have a drink  .  
 okay  .  i will try it  .  i suppose it is n't reasonable for me to refuse to go in . after all  gay people are n't afraid to go into normal bars  .  
 i 'm glad you feel that way . we ll leave in about ten minutes  alright  ?  
you 're late  .  
 i know i 'm late  .  i 'm sorry  .  i tried to call you to tell you  but your phone seems to be disconnected  .  
 my phone  ?  
 yes  .  an automatic message says your phone is not in service  .  
 really  ?  i had no idea  .  let me check . yes  it 's dead  .  there 's no dial tone  .  
 so i could n't get through  .  i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater  .  that 's why i 'm late  .  
 but this is terrible  .  i 'm expecting important calls  .  
 about what  ?  
 you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i do n't have a phone  .  oh  what can i do  ?  
 well  the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast  .  
 do you have a cell phone  ?  
 no  .  i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone  .  
 can you drive me  ?  i will go to ann's house  .  it is n't far  .  i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room  .  
 yes  of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away  ?  
 yes  i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house  then we 'll just return here . but if not  i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me  .  
 alright  let 's go  .  
did you hear  ?  the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city  !  soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business  !  
 are you serious  ?  gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain  !  it disgusts me  .  
 what are you talking about  ?  how does it exploit people  ?  
 well  to begin with  gambling is addictive  ruins marriages  destroys families and bankrupts communities  .  once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop  .  people have lost their houses  cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted  .  secondly  it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk  .  women gamble to escape  and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction  .  underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies  .  
 geez  !  now that i think about it  maybe legalizing gambling isn  t such a good idea  !  although  i have been to las vegas  and i didn  t become addicted or anything like that  .  
bill  .  bill  !  you gotta help me  !  
 what  s wrong  ?  slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack  .  
 tomorrow is christmas and i haven  t bought my mom anything  !  i  m such a bad son  !  
 take it easy  !  let  s go to the mall  window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like  .  
 that  s just it  !  i don  t know what to get her  !  last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small  !  i suck at getting presents for people  .  
 that  s where you  re making a big mistake  !  you can  t just guess peoples  likes or sizes  !  especially with clothes or jewelry  .  on top of that  i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her  .  at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like  !  
 yeah  you  re right  .  when it comes down to it  i can be pretty tacky  .  
 yeah  tell me about it  .  i know  !  your mom is trying to learn spanish  right  ?  why don  t you get her a gift certificate for this great website i saw called spanishpod  .  
honey  do you have a second  ?  
 sure  !  are you okay  ?  you seem a bit worried . what  s on your mind  ?  
 we need to talk  .  
 okay  .  .  .  
 i  ve been thinking  and well  i think we need to start seeing other people  .  
 what  ?  why  ?  i mean  we  ve had our ups and downs  and we have the occasional disagreement  but we  re happy together  aren  t we  ?  
 that  s just it  i  m not happy anymore  tim  .  it  s not you  it  s me  .  i know that i can be hard to deal with  and you are a great guy  !  you are the type of guythat any woman would kill for  !  
 so  what are you saying  ?  you  re breaking up with me because i  m perfect  ?  
 tim  you are too good for me  .  you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy  .  oh  i could say that i  ll be all you need  but that would be a lie  .  i know i  d only hurt you  i know i  d only make you cry  .  
 baby  come on  .  don  t do this to me  !  whatever it is  we can work it out  .  just give me another chance  !  i know that we can get through this  but we gotta stick together  !  don  t leave me  .  
 i can  t  tim  .  i hope someday you can find some way to understand i  m only doing this for you  .  i don  t really wanna go but  deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do  .  
 laura  .  .  .  
joanne  let  s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is  okay  ?  let  s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly  so we can go our separate ways  alright  ?  
 fine with me  .  i just want to get this over with  .  it  s important we make a clean break  .  i should have signed a prenup  .  
 what was that  ?  
 nothing  !  anyway  you  re right  there  s no reason this has to be nasty . my lawyer tells me you  ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property  as well as the custody agreement  i keep the cat and you get the dog  .  so that  s done  .  .  .  finally  .  
 let  s not go there  joanne  !  ok  so let  s start with the record collection  i  ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back  .  
 fine  but i  m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me  .  
 i believe that was a wedding present to both of us  joanne  .  and you hardly ever use it  !  
 he  s my grandfather  and he never really liked you anyway  !  
 whatever  !  alright  i  ll concede the silly gramophone  if you  ll agree that i get the silver tea set  .  
 how typical  when are you ever going to use a silver tea set  ?  fine  !  i don  t want to drag this out any longer than necessary  .  what  s next  ?  what about these old photographs  ?  
 which ones  ?  let me have a look . wow  look at that  !  that brings back memories  .  .  .  that  ?  
 our trip to italy  !  i remember that day  .  we were going to visit the trev fountain  and we got caught in the rain  .  .  .  
  .  .  .  and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet  .  i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley  smiling and laughing in the rain  .  .  .  
 oh  we really did have fun back then  didn  t we  ?  
 oh  joanne  are we making a big mistake  ?  i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can  t reconcile and try again  ?  i still love you  .  
 oh jeff  !  i love you too  !  i  m so glad we didn  t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle  .  
that was a great dinner  .  i did n't know that you knew how yo cook  .  
 i 'm glad you liked it  .  are you ready for dessert  ?  
 i do n't know  .  i 'm pretty full  .  what are we having  ?  
 i made strawberry shortcake  .  
 ooh  that 's my favorite  .  maybe i 'll have a small slice  .  
 great  .  would you like coffee or tea with that  ?  
 i 'll have a cup of tea  .  
 do you take cream or sugar with your tea  ?  
 actually  could i have some milk with that  ?  
 definitely  .  would you like skim or whole milk  ?  
 skim  please  .  that 'd be very nice  .  thanks  .  .  .  oh no  .  janna  i 'm so sorry  but i 've got to go  .  
 what happened  ?  
 i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident  .  i need to go pick her up  .  
 i 'll go with you  .  where is she  ?  
 she 's on the m40  near reading  .  
 is she alright  ?  
 i do n't know  she did n't say  .  i 'm so sorry about this  .  
 do n't worry  .  family comes first  .  come on  let 's go  .  
 actually  i 've only got a twoseater  .  i 'll have to go on my own  .  
 ok  .  just call me if you need anything then  .  
are your ready to go to the supermarket  ?  
 yes  are you  ?  
 i 've got my money and my keys  so i 'm ready  .  
 you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out  do n't you  ?  i 'd put a coat on if i were you  .  
 it was n't cold out this morning  .  
 well  it 's started raining since then  .  look out the window  !  it 's pouring rain out there  !  
 well  i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then  as well  .  
 have a look outside for me  .  does that look like hail to you  ?  
 it does  actually  .  maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it  .  
 ok  .  i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on  .  it 's a bit chilly in here  .  
 how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last  ?  
 i do n't know  .  the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night  .  
 maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse  .  
 i do n't think we have anything to worry about  .  do you want to put on a cup of tea as well  ?  
 good idea  .  that will help us to warm up  .  
 if i 'm not back in ten minutes  come and find me  .  
thank god you showed up when you did  !  he  s insane  !  do you think we should call the police  ?  
 don  t worry about it  i  ll call my friend and have him take care of it  .  i can  t believe he was stalking you all these years  .  what a nut job  !  
 i know  !  well  .  .  .  he said i  m not pregnant  .  i  m sorry if i got you all worked up over nothing  .  i want you to know that i didn  t do it on purpose  .  .  .  
 don  t apologize  !  from the moment i met you  not a day has gone by when i haven  t thought of you . and now that i  m with you again  i  m  .  .  .  i  m just scared  veronica  .  the closer i get to you  the worse it gets  .  the thought of not being with you  i mean  i just can  t handle it  !  we were made for each other  veronica  .  you are my everything  my soul mate  .  what can i do  ?  
 just hold me  .  .  .  i  ll always be here for you  no matter what  .  and together  we can tackle whatever life throws at us  .  i believe in us  steven  .  
 .  .  .  the rings please  .  may this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace  and continue in love until life  s end  .  
 with this ring i thee wed  .  wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment  .  
 honey  that  s my pinkie  .  the ring goes on the ring finger  !  
 this one  ?  
 that  s my index finger  !  
 oh  right  .  this one  right  ?  
 umm  .  .  .  that  s the thumb  nick  .  
 okay  okay  i got it  !  this is the ring finger  !  
we  ve been over this a thousand times  .  the data is irrefutable  !  look  we  ve done extensive research  built studies  and read the literature  and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory  !  
 horowitz  i beg to differ  .  even in your most recent study  the investigative approach was flawed  !  you know as well as i do that the collection of data was not systematic  and there is a large margin of error  .  to draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading 
 that is preposterous  !  
 you are trying to singlehandedly solve one of the world  s greatest mysteries  and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong  !  
 i am not wrong  !  the chicken came first  !  
hello everyone  !  i  m rick fields  and here with me is bob copeland  .  
 howdy folks  and welcome to today  s game  !  you know  rick  today is a key game between russia and canada  .  as you know  the winner will move on to the finals  .  
 that  s right  and it looks like we  re just about ready to start the match  .  the ref is calling the players for the faceoff  .  .  .  and here we go  !  the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack  !  federal gets checked hard into the boards  !  
 maurice richard has the puck now  and passes it to the center  .  he shoots  !  wow what a save by the goalie  !  
 alright  the puck is back in play now  .  pavel bure is on a breakaway  !  he is flying down the ice  !  the defenders can  t keep up  !  slap shot  !  he scores  .  
i found a new job after all  and i like this one even better than the last  .  
would you travel around the world if you had the money  ?  
what 's bothering that guy  ?  
do you think you will ever work at that company again  ?  
that was a tough question  .  how did you get it right  ?  
all of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and i 'm going too  !  
hello  .  where are you headed today  ?  
 i 'm off to barcelona for a week  .  
 do you have your passport with you  ?  
 yes  here you go  .  i do n't need a visa to go to spain  do i  ?  
 fortunately for you  you do n't  .  next time  if you have any questions about visas  you should try to find out before you get to the airport  .  
 that 's good advice  .  
 would you like a window seat or an aisle seat  ?  
 are there any seats available by the emergency exits  ?  
 let me see here  .  .  .  yes  there 's one left  .  
 ok  .  i 'll take that one then  .  
 alright  .  how many pieces of luggage are you checking in  ?  
 i like to travel light so i just have this one  .  
 if that 's your only piece of luggage  it is small enough to carry on with you  .  would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive  ?  
 yes  please  .  that 's a fantastic idea  .  which gate do i need to go to  ?  
i have some good news for you  .  we 've decided we 'd like to send you to shanghai on a business trip this weekend  .  
 oh  .  
 do n't you think that it 'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days  ?  
 sure  .  
 i thought you 'd be a bit more excited about this  .  everything will be paid for and i 'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you  .  all you have to do it get on the train tonight a 
 the train  ?  will i be flying back then  ?  
 oh  no  .  we 've brought your return ticket for you  .  i think you 'll find it comfortable  .  
 will the train be very crowded  ?  
 oh no  .  the train has n't been crowded at all recently  .  besides  you 're in firstclass  so you 'll be fine  .  
 when is the first meeting then  ?  
 they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 900 tomorrow morning  .  that should give you enough time to have a quick shower  .  
 where will i be staying  ?  
 we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings  so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system  .  
 that 's very sensible  .  would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip  ?  
the may holiday is coming up soon  .  are you planning on going on vacation  ?  
 i am  .  i just went to the travel agent  s and picked up these brochures  .  
 where are you planning on going  ?  
 i fancy going to tibet for a few days  .  have you ever been there  ?  
 i went a long time ago  before they built the new train that can take you there  .  
 would you recommend going there for a few days  ?  
 personally  i think it  d be better to go when you have more time  .  a few days isn  t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital  .  
 you  re probably right  .  what do you think about yangshao  ?  
 it  s a beautiful city  but i think it  s become too touristy  .  how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong  ?  
 i  d like to get away from the big city life  .  
 maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing  .  i heard they are very relaxing  .  
 i guess if i only have a few days  i should probably think about going somewhere that isn  t far away  .  
 since the may holiday is the high season  you should probably call ahead to reserve a room  .  here  s the phone number  .  
hey  frank  there is that janet check  .  
 wow  what a great burd  !  
 she sure knows how to strut her stuff  .  
 she 's a real turnon our rights  .  
 and look out she 's dressed  .  
 yeah  i noticed  .  she must be really loaded  .  
 no way  .  her old man is rich  .  he buys her anything she wants  .  
 lucky her  .  anyway  i think that is just as beautiful  .  
 i think you 've lost it  .  
 well  that 's my opinion  .  
 i admit that she is much prettier than kate  .  
 oh  there is no comparison  .  now we are talking but ugly  .  
welcome back  !  how was your vacation  ?  
 it was fantastic  but i 'm glad to be back  !  being a tourist is really tiring  !  
 where did you end up going  ?  
 because it 's offseason  we got a really good package deal to paris  so we went there  .  
 i 've always wanted to go to paris  .  the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world  !  did you go to the top  ?  
 that was the first thing we did  .  i have a few pictures  .  do you want to see them  ?  
 sure  .  what 's this one a picture of  ?  
 oh  that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling  .  i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city  .  
 you do n't look very happy in that picture  .  
 no  by that time  i was sick of sightseeing  .  i had had enough of art galleries  cathedrals  fountains  statues  and palaces  !  
 so what did you do  ?  
 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market  .  we had a few coffees  watched a movie  and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel  .  
 my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing  .  did you go to the louvre  ?  
 of course  !  you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery  !  i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though  .  
hi  how are you doing  ?  
 everything 's great  .  and you  ?  
 same here  .  have you seen any new films recently  ?  
 no  i have n't had a chance to  .  but i 've been watching a chinese tv series called chinesestyle divorce  .  
 oh  really  ?  i saw it two years ago  .  it 's worth seeing and it 's thoughtprovoking  .  
 yeah  .  i found it is so close to our life  .  
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this everchanging world  .  
 you said it  .  you know  the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years  .  
 well  it 's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too  .  
 i know a couple who divorced a week after getting married  .  
 oh  that 's too shortlived  .  
 that 's true  .  it 's said the shortlived marriage is typical of the post  80s generation  .  
 i ca n't agree more  .  the onlychild generation in china tends to know little about marriage  .  
 definitely  .  they do n't take relationships and marriages very seriously  .  
 in their mind  love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone  .  
oh  hi  jessica  are you going to see this movie too  ?  
 i 'd love to  the movies are smash hit  .  
 then let 's go in  .  
 i ca n't  .  i 'm waiting for paul  but he 's late  .  
 i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute  .  
 i know  .  i wonder what 's keeping him  .  
 looks like he wo n't show up  .  he 's done this before  has n't he  ?  
 yeah  a number of times  .  
 what 's he trying to pull anyway  .  
 i do n't know  .  but this is definitely the last straw  .  
 maybe you should start seeing someone else  .  
more and more chinese are marrying foreigners  .  
 that 's true  .  but i have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners  .  
 oh  why  ?  
 i think some chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad  .  there is no true love between them  .  
 i would n't say that 's totally true  .  i 've met many happy intercultural couples  .  
 well  then why are n't there many eastwest couples where the man is a chinese and the woman is a westerner  ?  
 i guess it 's because the chinese women are more attractive to western men  .  
 or because they are less attractive to to chinese men  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 you know  usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl  .  
 a left girl  ?  what 's that  ?  
 they 're called that because they 're left behind on the shelf  .  they 're also known by their three h 'shigh diploma  high salary  and high degree  .  and they 're also known as the three s 's  single  
 you have a point here  but i believe some mixed marriages are based on true love  .  
if you can choose  will you marry a foreigner or a chinese  ?  
 why  ?  did tom pop the question  ?  
 not yet  .  but i wonder if i can get my parents  consent  .  
 let me guess  your parents want you to marry a chinese man  right  ?  
 you are right  .  it is giving me a real headache  .  i feel like i  m between a rock and a hard place  .  
 i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex  .  
 oh  how did you deal with it  ?  
 i just let it go and continued dating with my korean boyfriend  .  but finally we broke up  .  
 oh  it  s a pity  .  what was the matter  ?  
 simple  .  we had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences  .  
 like what  ?  
 he hoped to live in the korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family  .  
 oh  i see  .  in their culture women should put family first  .  
 yes  he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family  .  but i simply can not quit working  .  
 so that 's why it  s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner  .  
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget  .  do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed  ?  
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner  ?  
 but we 've done that many times  .  we want something fresh this time  .  
 okay  let me think  .  what about a partyandmovie night  ?  we can rearrange our reference room  invite a band to play some music  order in some food and watch a movie later  .  
 sounds like a good idea  but a band sounds too expensive  .  
 well  we can ask people to make small contributions  .  
 i don t think so  .  i do n't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come  .  but we certainly can cut costs in other ways  such as make the party byob  .  
 byob  ?  what 's that  ?  
 bring your own beverage  .  we can provide food  but people have to bring their own drinks  .  
 so we 're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks  ?  i do n't know how well that will go over  .  
 maybe you have a point  .  how about having a party on a friday afternoon  ?  we 'll stop early  order some pizza  and serve drinks  .  there 'll be music but no band  .  having the party in the office will make 
what 's the weather like in your city  ?  
 in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier  .  
 the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow  .  
 what are the temperatures in winter  ?  in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees  .  
 in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms  .  
 yeah  we do  .  in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon  .  i heard your city has a lot of fog  is that true  ?  
 we do have a few foggy days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly over your city  are they  ?  
 yes  they are  .  like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually only last a few hours . then the skys are clear again  .  
 have you ever had snow in your city  ?  
 my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i only see it outside of our city  .  
 the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . on summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean  .  
both our countries are quite small  .  how would you describe the landscape in your country  ?  
 my country is well know for being very flat  .  there are some hills in the southeast of the country  .  
 is it really completely flat  ?  
 pretty much  .  the land rises and falls only a few meters  .  the southeast  the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters  .  there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country  .  
 yes  there are  .  they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries  .  
 the coast of your country is very varied  .  the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches  .  
 that doesn  t sound too bad  .  great for sunbathing  !  the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers  .  there are cliffs  then sandy beaches  .  then rocks  .  there are lots of caves in the cliffs  .  
 there are many lakes and rivers in your country too  .  we also have many rivers  but only a few lakes  .  
is there a lot of crime in your city  ?  
 there  s some  but i don  t think it  s a big problem  .  a lot of it is petty crime  burglary and car theft  .  there  s very little major crime  .  
 it  s the same in my city  .  we also have a lot of drug addicts  .  a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs  .  
 that happens in many places  .  in my city  there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme  .  the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes  but i don  t know if that  s the reason for 
 some people believe that a tough approach is better  .  other prefer a more lenient approach  .  
 i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly  .  if most people have similar amounts of money  they will not think of stealing from others  .  
which countries have you been to  ?  
 i  ve been to most of the countries in europe  several countries in asiachina  japan  korea  and thailandand to the united states and canada  .  
 i thought you had been to australia too  .  
 no  but i  m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon  .  i  ve heard that they are beautiful countries  .  which is the most beautiful country you  ve been to  ?  
 i think i  d say norway  .  it has many picturesque fjords  waterfalls  and mountains  .  
 isn  t it really cold there  ?  
 well  the north of norway is almost always cold  but further south it can be fairly warm in summer  .  it  s a wet country  so there  s snow almost everywhere in winter  .  
when in rome  do as the romans do  they say  .  
 what do the romans do  ?  
 they live in rome  of course  and go to work by car or bus  .  but sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams  so they walk  .  
 in other words  the romans do what everyone else does  .  
 yes  but they do it differently  .  everything is different  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 well  the climate 's different for a start  .  it does n't rain so much as it does in england  .  the sun shines more often  .  
 i envy them the sun  .  
 i know  .  you hate the rain  do n't you  ?  
 i certainly do  .  
 and a roman really ioves life  .  eye knows how to enjoy himself  .  
 they always eat spaghetti and drink wine  do n't they  ?  
 not always  .  but they like a good meal  .  lots of tourists go to rome just for the food  you know  .  
 really  ?  how much does it cost to fly to rome  ?  
hello  jim  .  where are you going  ?  
 to the cinema  .  what about coming with me  ?  
 no  thanks  .  i 'm going home  .  my wife 's expecting me  .  
 what a pity  .  i believe it 's a very good film  .  
 do you go to the cinema a lot  ?  
 once a week  .  most nights i sit at home and watch telly 
 do you know what 's on tonight by any chance  ?  
 no  i 'm sorry i do n't  .  i never read the papers till i get home  .  
 oh  i see  .  by the way  where are you going for your holidays this year  ?  
 i do n't know yet  .  my wife 's going to her mother 's for a couple of weeks  .  she livesay the sea  you know  .  
 oh  does she  ?  that 's convenient  .  
 yes  but i want to go to the country  .  
 do n't you like the sea  ?  
 yes  very much  .  but i need peace and quiet when i 'm on holiday  .  what are coughing to do  ?  
 i 'm going to stay at home  .  
 are n't you going to have a holiday abroad this year  ?  
let 's play chess  .  
 i have n't played chess for a long time  .  
 that 's all right  i 'm a beginner  .  i 've just learnt how to play  .  
 look  there 's a chessboard  .  those two men have already finished playing  .  
 you 're a very good player 
 not really  but once i won a prize  .  
 so did i  .  i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners  .  
what was the party like last night  jean  ?  
 not bad at all  thanks  .  there were one or two interesting people there . why could n't you come  ?  
 well  i could n't get away from work early  .  and when  .  i got home i had a headache  so i had to go straight to bed  .  but i was overtired  because i was n't able to get to sleep for hours  .  
 what a shame  .  why did n't you take a sleeping pill  ?  
 i do n't like them  .  i used to take them when i had to work overtime  you know  .  
 how many did you use to take  ?  
 three every night  .  
 good heavens  .  why did you take so many  ?  
 because i was under a terrible strain  .  the doctor saidthey were n't very strong  .  anyway  i used to feel awful the next morning  .  
 i 'm sure you did  .  
 the doctor said i had to be careful  .  
 he was quite right  .  
wake up sleepyhead . the sun is beginning to shine  .  what a lovely summer day  !  
 yeah  clearly blue sky . but it is a bit too hot for me  .  i do n't like heat and humidity  .  
 it 's not that hot  .  it 's cooler than yesterday  .  let 's go swimming  !  
 that 's a thought  .  it 's still early  and the beach is n't crowded at this time of the day  .  if we do n't stay too long  we wo n't get sunburned  .  
 yeah  sounds like fun  .  i can wear my new pink bikini  .  
 there wo n't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are  .  
 who cares  !  well  the smart guys get there early  .  that 's the kind of guy i want to meet  .  let 's go  !  
 if you are going to husband hunting in a bikini  then i want to wear one  too  .  
 ok  you could borrow one of mine  .  
 thanks  how about the green and black one  ?  
when was america discovered  tony  ?  
 i 'm not certain  .  do you know  ?  
 america was discovered by christopher columbus in 1492  .  
 in a way that 's right  .  but the vikings travelled there long beforecolumbus  .  and what about the red indians  ?  
 all right  .  ask me a question now  .  
 who invented the electric light bulb  ?  
 that 's easy  .  it was invented by edison  .  
 correct  .  now for a harder question  .  who will be the first men on mars  ?  
 i ca n't answer that  .  but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century  .  
 ask me a question now  .  
 all right  .  what is the nearest planet to the sun  ?

you look really wiped out  .  
 i had meetings back to back all morning  .  then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the six soap presentation  and the phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office  .

hello mary  .  i haven  t seen you for ages  .  are you still seeing paul  ?  
 no  .  we broke up last month  .  i  m taking a break from dating for a while  .  
 did you break up amicably  ?  sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up  .  
 we just decided to stop seeing each other  .  it was all very amicable  .  are you still going out with mike  ?  
 yes  i am  .  we  re thinking about getting engaged  .  we  ve been dating for over a year now  .  
 good for you  !  have you seen kelly recently  ?  is she still dating nick  ?  
 i hav n't seen her for a while . she stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her . he was seeing a girl form his office . one day  she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately  .  
 she was right to do that  .  i heard the neil and tina getting married soon  .

how are you wedding plans going  ?  
 very well  .  we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done  .  the only thing that isn  t ready yet is my wedding dress  .  
 when will that be ready  ?  
 the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks  .  
 you  re getting married in three weeks  .  so that should be ok  .  so  you  ve prepared the church  catering  transport  hoteleverything  .  
 yes  .  we  ve taken care of all of that  .  we decided not to get married in a church though  .  neither of us is very religious  .  
 which hotel will the reception be held at  ?  
 the palace hotel they  re taking care of the catering  including the wedding cake  .  i  m sure they  ll do a good job  .  
 oh  yes  .  it  s and excellent hotel  .  a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect  though very expensive  .  
 yes  .  it will be expensive  but we think it will be worth it  .  it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people  .  
how many people are in your family  ?  
 as you know  china has a singlechild policy  .  therefore  there  s just my husband  my daughter and i  .  what about in your family  ?  
 i have one daughter and one son  .  then there  s my husband and i  .  what about your parents  ?  do they live with your family  ?  
 not anymore  .  they live with my brother now  .  and yours  ?  
 my parents live by themselves now  .  when they get older  they  ll probably go to a retirement home  .  do you just have one brother  ?  
 no  i have two older brothers and one younger sister  .  what about you  ?  
 i also grew up in a big family  .  i have one older brother and three younger sisters  .  
 how long have you been married  ?  
 about seven years now  .  and you  ?  
 i  ve been married for about five years  .  what do you think about divorce  ?  
 it  s becoming more and more common  .  however  i don  t ever want to get divorced myself  !  what about you  ?  
 if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly  i would get a divorce  .  
 if that happens  maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws  !  
  ha ha  i  ll keep that in mind  but don  t tell my husband  .  
that girl looks very attractive  doesn  t she  ?  
 do you think so  ?  i don  t like girls who look like that  .  i like girls who are not too slim  .  if you like her  go and talk to her  .  
 i  d like to  but there  s her boyfriend  .  he  s very broadshouldered  .  
 he  s huge  !  he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that  .  
 do you prefer tall girls or short ones  ?  
 i don  t mind  but i like girls with long hair  .  
 we have different tastes  .  i like girls with short hair  .  i like tall girlsprobably because i  m so tall myself  .  
 have you ever dated a girl taller than you  ?  
 no  never  .  i don  t think i  ve ever met a girl taller than me  !  have you gained weight recently  ?  
 yes  i have  .  perhaps i should go to the gym  like that girl  s boyfriend  .

 he can spend more time with his grandchildren  .  
 oh  i do n't think he wants to  .  he wants to travel to several different countries around the world  .

 i enjoy listening to all kinds of music  .  
 what kind  ?  
 i like to listen to rock and r  b  .

 may i suggest family sweet  ?  you all just have a consolation  .  
 what  s it like  ?  
 it  s a big room with a king  size double bed and two single beds  .  you  ve get also an rollerwheels  .  
 that  s great  .  how much is it  ?  
 2000 hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax  .  
 that  s fine  .

 yes  but not too stiff  right  ?  
 exactly  .  is it possible to have my overcoat drycleaned  too  ?  
 there are a few spots on it  .  i am afraid you will not have it tomorrow  .  drycleaning usually takes three days  .  
 oh  no  .  i also need this tomorrow evening  .  
 in that case  i suppose i could ask the drycleaner to clean up the spots for the moment  and have it well pressed  .  you might get it back on time then  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  
 by the way  a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday  .  
 yes  i noticed it yet  .  
 the laundry has sewed on a new button for you  .  
 oh  thanks a lot  .  
 i am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others  .  
 never mind  it does n't matter  .  
i am sorry to say this but i seem to have lost the key to the safe  .  
 where do you think you lost it  ?  outside the hotel  ?

 um  .  .  .  do you think we can make a pit stop  ?  
 but we  ve only been on the road for ten minutes  .  
well  i 'm glad you 're finally back  .  i was wondering what happened  .  
 i feel kind of stupid  .  
 why  ?  
 we got lost coming back  .  i guess i do n't really know this town yet  .  
 you got lost  .  you 're kidding  !  
 no  .  we took a wrong turn somewhere . and joseph does n't know the town at all  .  so i started giving him directions . but i did n't really know where we were  .  so we got seriously lost  .  
 you could have called  .  
 i know i could have  .  but finally we asked someone where we were  .  
 you 've been gone for two hours  .  how could you get lost for so long  ?  
 guess where we ended up  .  
 i do n't know  .  where  ?  
 when we finally decided to ask someone  they told us we were in grangerfield  .  
 grangerfield  !  you were in grangerfield  ?  that 's a completely different town  !  how could you drive to a completely different town  ?  
 i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here  .  
 grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here  .  
 i know it is  .  i do n't know how it happened  .  
 hmm  maybe i do  .  
 what  ?  
 maybe i have an idea how it happened  .  
 how  ?  
 you were too busy looking at joseph  and you were n't paying attention to the road  .  
 oh  that 's what you think  huh  ?  
 yes  that 's what i think . maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries  you 'll get lost for even longer . maybe six hours or so  .  
 you know what  trish  ?  
 what  ?  
 i hope so  .  i really hope so  .  
 hah  hah  !  see  ?  i guessed right  .  you were n't watching the road at all  .  
what can i do for you  sir  ?  
 i am tim green in room 1021 and i want a wakeup call at five thirty am tomorrow  .  
 yes  i see  .  five thirty am mr  .  green  room 1021  .  
 i want to change my wakeup time  .

 tim  in room 1021  .

 yeah  it stretches over for thousands of miles  .  
 i know  .  it 's a major symbol of china  .  
 where can we climb it  ?  
 do we have any choices  ?  
 well  we could take the cable car  .  
 ah  .  .  .  let 's just climb  .  it 's more fun  i think  .  
 okay  .  let 's go  .  
 well  that was tough  .  
 but we made it  .  
 this looks great  .  when was it built  ?  
 it was first built about twentyfive hundred years ago  .  
 that 's remarkable  .  
excuse me  .  is this the right way to the museum  ?  
 i 'm afraid you 're going in the opposite direction  .  go back the way you came  and take the second turn on the left  .  the museum is straight ahead  right in front of you  .  
 will it take me long to get there  ?  
 well  it 's about fifteen minutes walk  .  
 which bus goes there  ?  
 you may take a no  .  34 bus  .  and the subway can also take you there  .

 this is room elevenseven and my name is terry chen  .  
 well  let me check . we delivered four bags to room 1106  you friend 's room about an hour ago  .  
 my friend 's room  ?  oh  i see . thanks a lot  .  
hello  .  i 'm now trying to take a bath  but there are too many buttons . would you tell me how to use them  ?  
 i see  we have explanation leaflet on the table . if you follow the directions it is quite simple  .  
 i read it  but i could n't understand it . would you come to my room and tell me how to use them  ?  
 oh  certainly  .  
i ca n't get into my room  .  i mean i left my room key inside  .  
 i see  sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago  .  
 oh  did they  ?  well  would you give us an extra key to the room  ?  
 i 'm afraid we have no extra key . so i 'll send somebody to your room  .  
 by the way  what should i do with the key when i go out  ?  
hello . hot water overflowed from the bathtub . will you help me  ?  
 would you turn off the tap  ?  
 i did it  .  
 then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door  ?  
 ok  .  i will  .  
 i 'll have our housekeeper come right away  .  
 i 'm sorry i was too tired to fall asleep  .  
 when you woke up  the water was coming out of the tub  .  
hello . is this room service  ?  
 yes . may i help you  ?  
 this is room 1425 . we asked for the room service an hour ago  .  
 we 're very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience  .  
 what 's the matter  ?  
 we 're rather busy right now . it will take another 15 minutes  .  
 is it really going to take that long  ?  will you rush the order  ?  
 i 'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most  .  
i am sorry to trouble you  but there 's a lot of noise in the next room  .  
 oh  is there  ?  which room is it  ?  
 it 's  .  i think  neighbours on the right  .  
 you mean the room thirteenthirteen  ?  
 i 'm not sure  but i think so  .  i 'm very exhausted  but i ca n't sleep  .  
 all right  ma 'am  .  i 'll check and tell them to be quiet  .  
i am sorry to say this  but i seem to have lost the key to the safe  .  
 where do you think you lost it  ?  outside the hotel  ?  
 yes  i believe so . how should i compensate for this  ?  
 i 'm afraid  ma 'am  you have to pay u  .  s  .   100 since you lost the key  .  
 what  !  one hundred u  .  s  .  dollars . is it covered by the insurance  ?  
excuse me  .  where is the beijing railway station  ?  
 you can take the subway to get there 
 how long will i take it to get there  ?  
 it  s takes only about 10 minutes 
 may i take a bus or a taxi to get there  ?  
 you can take no  .  1 bus or taxi 
 excuse me  .  sir  .  where is the no  .  1 bus stop  ?  
 pleas turn right at the traffic lights  .  
how is the result of your lab test  ?  
 when it comes to that  i have a lot to say  .  
 then say it  .  
 when i went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests  i tried to keep a poker face even though i was scared to death  .  then you guess what he said  .  
 that  s just what i want to know  .  
excuse me  .  i need to refill this prescription  .  
 it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills  .  
 yes  i need to refill it today  .  
 alright  .  i 'm sorry  miss  .  according to our file  this prescription has already been refilled twice  .  
 i was worried about that  .  i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not  .  
 well  it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription  .  
 listen  .  this is an emergency  .  i tried to call my doctor  but he is out of town  .  so i ca n't see him in time  .  i need this medicine  .  it is for skin condition  .  i 've run out . can you just refill it once more  ?  
 i 'm sorry  miss  .  we ca n't do it  .  we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out  .  
 but i need it  .  please  .  refill it for me just this once  .  i can go to the doctor around ten days from now  .  then i 'll have another prescription  .  
 miss  i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law  .  i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription  .  never  .  
 but i have a prescription  .  i just need more of it  .  
 a prescription must be valid  .  it cannot be an expired prescription  .  i 'm sorry  miss  .  it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you  .  
 oh  it will be so expensive  !  i have a special medical plan  and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor  .  
 miss  i just ca n't help you on this  .  i 'm a pharmacist  not a doctor  .  and there are other customers i need to help now  .  i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it  .  i 'm sorry  .  
 this is ridiculous  !  in taiwan  it is much easier to get medicine when i need it  .  
what 's wrong with you  young man  ?  
 doctor  i have a bad cough and a headache  .  
 do you have a fever  ?  
 i do n't know  but i feel terrible  .

oh  this is monica 
 ok  .  commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract  .  
 yes  .  let 's first define the inspection right  .  
 following the rules of world business  the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery  while the importers have the right to reinspect the goods after their arrival  .  
 would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency  ?  
 inspection is to be done by the china commodity inspection and testing bureau  .  usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment  .  
 and can you tell me about the reinspection  ?  
 yes  .  the reinspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival  and if any discrepancy is found  the claim must be raised within one month  .  
 i see  .  how do they make testing and analysis of this item  ?  
 they always use the standard and method laid down in the contract  .  
 what if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other  ?  
i 've been working hard for a whole year  .  i really need a break  .  
 that 's true  .  you need to take some time off to relax  .  
 you said it  .  i 'm looking forward to my annual vacation  .  
 when are you going to take your vacation  ?  
 later this month  .  i ca n't wait  !  
your pc is so amazing  .  are you doing trade on internet  ?  
 thank you for your compliment  .  i bought this pc with my firstmonth salary  .  i am getting to know the online trade  .  
 i 'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet  .  
 yes  i often do business through internet now  .  
 oh  really  ?  is it a good way  ?  
 yes  very gorgeous  .  sometimes  i can deal with my business without stepping out of our house  .  
 what advantages does it have  ?  
 firstly  it is convenient  .  and secondly  it has low cost  because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service  .  
 i agree with you  .  it will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition  .  
 the most important is that it is very convenient  .  you know you can browse the website and send emails to your customers at any time  .  even you can have econtract with your regular customers  .  
 so cool  if we do business through other ways  it will cost a lot of time  .  
 sure  but every coin has two sides  .  doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways  .  
 will you give me some suggestion  ?  
 of course  such as alabama  which is a famous website  .  
mr  .  wang  have you enjoyed your stay here  ?  
 of course  i  ve enjoyed it very much  .  i  ve met my old friends and made some new friends  .  
 we  ve all enjoyed being with you  .  when will you come back  ?  
 sometime next year  .  
 i  m looking forward to seeing you again  .  take care  .  
i heard you were promoted to general manager of ibm  s china head quarters  .  
 that  s true  .  i got the news yesterday  .  
 you did a good job for the company  .  so  this is your first day in the new position  .  how do you feel  ?  
 not bad  .  i  m confident  .  and i like challenges  .  
 i believe you are cut out for this position  .  
hello  fred  .  what are you doing  ?  
 i 'm doing the business online  .  
 can you tell me the concept of ecommerce  ?  now  many people mentioned the word  ecommerce  in front of me  .  
 ecommerce  or electronic commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the internet  .  
 what kinds of channels can you use in ecommerce  ?  
 we can complete a trade by email  electronic data interchange and smart cards  and so on  .  
 what are the benefits of ecommerce  ?  
 firstly  it can overcome the geographic limitation  .  and secondly  ecommerce can lower the internal costs  .  and thirdly  people like us  can also open stores on internet  .  
your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market  .  we have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent  .  
 we appreciate your intention  but the amount of your orders last year was moderate  .  
 that 's true  .  however at the fair last march  people were so interested in chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase  .  
 do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent  ?  
 i 'm sure it will  if we are appointed your agent  .  your garments are attractive  and we  a wellestablished importer with multiple sales channels  can boost the sales  .  
i know that you are interested in our washers  .  
 yes  we are thinking of placing an order  .  however we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms  including mode of payment  discount and possible date of delivery  .  
 we supply washers of all types and sizes  .  we have years of experience in the manufacture of washers  .  
 we have read about this in your sales literature  .  could you give us some idea of your prices  ?  
 our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in europe or anywhere else  .  here are our latest price lists  .  you will see that our prices are very attractive  .  
 do you take special orders  ?  that is  do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients  ?  
 sure  we do  .  
 how long does it usually take you to make delivery  ?  
 as a rule  we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant l  c  .  it takes longer  of course  for special orders  .  in no case would it take longer than six months  .  
 good  .  one more thing  we 'd like you to quote us on cif basis  .  
mr  .  smith  i would like to get right to the point here  .  first  we need to talk about how much each company will pay  .  
 well  we want to have the largest share  .  our company is much larger than yours  and we have been in business longer  .  
 let 's look at that another way  .  the major point is the value that we add  not who has been in business longer  or is bigger  .  
 what are you thinking about  ?  
 we do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position  .  we are a good  small companythat 's why you are interested  .  
 then  what would make you feel more comfortable  ?

 absolutely not  !  you are highly contagious  !  you don  t want to infect the rest of your coworkers do you  ?  i recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don  t get weak and dehydrated  .  you can catch up on all the latest tv shows and movies  !  
 ok  !  would you mind writing me a doctor  s note for work  otherwise they may think i am faking it  !  
 haha  sure not a problem  !  here you are . now off you go and away to bed  .  if you have any questions just give me a call  !  feel better soon and take care  .

 no  i have n't  .  i need help quick  .  it hurts really badly  .  
 i understand  .  it 's good you came to the emergency room  .  
 let me see a doctor  .  
 i 'm sorry  sir  .  you will need to wait at least a short time . we are very busy tonight  .  there was a big car accident on highway 106  .  
 i thought this was the emergency room  .  
 it is  .  but unless you are critically injured  you still need to wait . you are n't bleeding  are you  ?  
 no  .  only a little  .  i fell off my porch  .  
 oh  that 's terrible  .  is it your right arm or your left arm  ?  
 my left arm  .  
 can you fill out this form then  ?  
 no  i ca n't  .  i 'm lefthanded  .  
 that 's very inconvenient for you then . you ll probably have a cast on your left arm  .  
 yes  .  but why do i have to fill out a form anyway  ?  this is the emergency room  .  
 yes  it is  .  but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done . have you ever been in an emergency room before  ?  
 no  .  just let me see a doctor  .  i 'm worried about my arm  .  
 be brave  sir  .  it wo n't be long  .  i will fill out the form for you  .  what is your name  ?

 yes  i am  but i think it  s time for some plastic surgery i  m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin  .  see  ?  
 i don  t see any wrinkles or sagging skin  !  you are 25  stop being ridiculous  .  besides  i think that people who get boto  have facelifts  or tummy tucks look weird  .  it doesn  t look natural  .  
 whatever  i think i  m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well  .  
 i think you need to get brain surgery  .  i honestly don  t think you need cosmetic surgery  .  you look amazing  .  
 i thought you were my friend and would support me on this  !  i just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive  .  
 you don  t need plastic surgery to do that  .  you are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you  !  plus  plastic surgery hurts  !

is this the first time you 've come to our city  mr  .  ross  ?  
 correct  .  i have expected to visit here for a long time  .  so fortunate for me  i can realize this expectation and meet you  arden  and your kindhearted staff in your company  .  
 i am so honored to hear that  .  well  after staying here for several days  you must have some ideas about our company  .  we have been in the clothes field for many years  and yours brand is also wellknown in the country  .  how about our cooperation  ?  
 that is one of reasons why i am here now  .  i am really willing to have some cooperation with your company  .  
thank you for your interest in this job  .  you 'll be hearing from us  .  send the next applicant in on your way out  please  .

 yes  please  .  my telephone number is 367  1314  .  you can call me between four and six in the afternoon  .  
 we 'll get in touch with you by next wednesday  .  thank you for your interest in this job  .  
 how are you  mr  .  ding  ?  i  m john brown  .  
 pleased to meet you  mr  .  brown  .  
 please have a seat  .  i know our employment officer has already given you the information about your employee contract  but i  d like to go over the main details again before signing the contract  .  first  you  ll be getting a monthly salary  with one month paid vacation after one year of service  .  no probation is involved  .  
 that  s what i understand  .  
 you  ll be covered by our medical plan while on duty  .  since you  ll be middleanagement  you  re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours  .  any approved overtime that will be paid at time  which you can take as salary or time off  .  
 exactly my understanding  .  
 a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company  .  any extended illness will be covered by insurance  .  have you read the other terms of the contract  ?  
 yes  i have  .  
 do you have any questions  ?  
 just one  .  i noticed an item about flextime  .  is that a possibility for me  ?  
 yes it is  but you  ll have to discuss the details with your manager  .  
how can i help you  sir  ?  
 i am here to have a discussion on your company 's investment issue  .  
 sorry  could you tell me your name  ?  
 i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova  .  
 do you have an appointment  ?  
 yes  i did it yesterday  .  our meeting should be 2 pm  .  
 i guess she forgot your meeting  .  she is attending an important meeting in the company  .  will you have a seat  ?  may i leave a memo for her  ?  
 thank you  .  
here i raise a question for you  .  just imagine we will have a foreign guest from japan  .  can you tell me how i ought to be to the most comfortable and polite  ?  
 firstly  we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes  .  and then on the day when he is coming  we wait for him at the gate of our company 's gate  .  
 well  that 's right  .  how about on a formal occasion  ?  what should i say to show my gratitude  ?  
 it 's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group  .  
 and then  what should we do next when you meet the guests  ?  
 maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break  meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know  .  
mr  .  chandler will be our new partner  so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future  because it may decide whether mr  .  chandler sign the trade contract with us or not  .  do you have some idea  ?  
 i suppose we can bring him to visit our company  as well as our display room  .  in this way  he can know more about our company and our potential power  .  in my opinion  visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much  .  
 en  you are right  and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon  .  but remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret  .  on one hand  show his our best side  on the other hand  do not show too much to protect our own business secrets  .  
 well  i understand  .  
dear fellows  .  as you know  mr  .  ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company  .  
 i really want to stay a little longer  but i still have a meeting to attend  .  all in all  i am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome  .  thank you for the trouble you have taken  .  
 just as what i said in my welcome speech  mr  .  ross 's visit to our company is meaningful for both our two companies  .  thank you very much for your visiting  .  we will miss you all the time  .  
 during my trip here  i learned a lot and i get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right  .  i can feel and sense the potential of your company  .  and at last i wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful  .  
 that 's our pleasure  .  mr  .  ross  your visit leaves gorgeous memory here  .  and i hope mr . halmiton  the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon  .  remember me to him  please  .  
thank you for seeing me  .  did you look over my letter and resume  ?  
 yes  .  quite good  .  perhaps you 're very interested in the social benefits  .  
 yes  i think it is possible more important than the salary  .  
 really  ?  we would like to start you off at 2000 yuan a month  excluding bonus and overtime pay  .  
 good  about the essential living conditions  ?  
 well  we 'll supply you with an apartment of a bedroom and a living room  .

 yes  in our company  the women have a twoweek vacation a year  besides this  if you are a married woman  maternity leave for some months is permitted  .  
 i think it is very necessary for us  .  i wonder whether i am on holiday with payment every year  .  
 yes  you have a paid month holiday every year  .  
 right  .  how about the unemployment compensation and the retirement pension  ?  
 well  we are only responsible for the retirement pension  .  about the unemployment compensation  this will be given by the government  .  
mr  .  wang  i want to apologize for being late again this morning  .  i just ca n't get up in time for work  .  
 so it seems  .  and what are you going to do about that  ?  
walter  did you email that document to mr  .  lin yesterday  ?  
 yes  i did  ms  .  chen  .  
 that 's strange  .  i have mr  .  lin on the phone right now  and he says that he did n't receive any email from us yesterday  .  are you sure you sent it  ?  
mr  .  tang  we have decided to hire you  .  how much do you expect to get a month  ?  
 i 'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work  .  i should not  of course  make a change for less  .  could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan  ?  
 i don  t think we can give you that much as the starting salary  .  
 you know  mr  .  allen  nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience  .  
 maybe  but there are many fringe benefits here  .  
 what are they  ?  
 additional to medical benefits  we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car  .  
 but i have my own car and my own house  .  
 ok  4000 yuan a month  .

what sort of salary did you get at your previous job  ?

 yes  i think so  .  that would be more than i have wished  .  
 good  .  we also have health insurance  bonus and paid vacation  .  when can you begin to work  ?

julia  i would like to have a word with you  .  have a seat  .  
 thank you  .  
 according to your performance  i decided to give you a salary increase  .  from next month  there will be a 2000 yuan raise to your salary  .  although your first raise might not sound considerable  the company believes that with your ability  sooner or later you 'll get a better raise  .  
 thank you very much  .  mr  .  george  .  as a newcomer  i understand that you have your consideration and i am satisfied with the raise  .  
 i think you deserved this  .  
are you paid on a commission or salary basis now  ?  
 i 'm paid on a salary  .  
 what 's your monthly salary  ?  
 at present i get 1800 yuan per month  .  
 how much do you hope to get a month here  ?  
 that 's not the problem i care about  .  you can decide on my capacity and experience  .  
 if we decide to hire you  we 'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start  .  you can have saturdays and sundays off  .  besides  you may have a paid month holiday every year  .  how do you think about it  ?

 i agree  but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems  .  we do n't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance  .  
how often do you service the pump  ?  
 we take very good care of this particular pump  .  it 's a crucial part of our process  .  we clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift  we check the high pressure seals  recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly  .  we replace the gaskets every month  .  
 how do you decide how often these things need to be done  ?

john has n't turned up and stefan is ill  .  do we have anyone on standby  ?

how do you do  ?  i need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest  !  
 fine  .  i have your letter and i 've made some notes  .  
 how can i find out what countries to invest  ?  
 we have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population  consumption  production  and foreign exchange reserves  .  
 great  .  i want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries  .  
could you tell me something about investment environment of your country  ?  
 our country is a free trade nation  .  she was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy  .  parallel to this  her dependence upon foreign trade has increased  .  increased output generates a greater need for raw materials  semifinished products and capital goods  .  thus  .  in many fields  our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries  .  but this does n't mean that our country is an easy market  because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen  .  
 well  what about price  ?  
how many years have you done business with china  ?  
 let me see  about five years  we established our business relationship with hua mei of china import  export corporation in 2003  .  
 do you have any difficulties in doing business in china  ?  you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete  ?  
 i do n't think i have any problem with our chinese partners  .  they have always followed the contract strictly  .  we can do business directly with the corporation  .  as i mentioned before  the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law  .  its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies  .  
 well  it 's known that the sinoamerican relation is in a dilemma  .  does it influence your business in china  ?  
 actually not at present  .  but we are afraid it will  .  you know policies influence business to some extent  .  i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists  .  china is really a large market  .  we do n't want to lose it  .  
 thank you  .  
what is your greatest strength  ?  
 i think i am very good at planning  .  i manage my time well so that i can always get things done on time  .  
 what is your weakness  ?  
 i always give each job my best efforts  so when others are not pulling their weight  i am frustrated  .  
 what is your greatest accomplishment  ?  
 i got the scientific research prize from the gansu government for my achievements in the northwest regional economy development research project  .  
 can you work under pressure  ?  
 working under pressure is exciting and challenging  .  i don  t mind  .  in fact  i am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work  .  
 what are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them  ?  
 there was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time  .  i then had to handle their work temporarily  .  the workload was incredibly heavy  .  so i started to set priorities for the jobs and hired parttime staff to handle routine work  .  finally  i managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy  .  
 how do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with  ?  
do you have any special skills  ?  
 i can write computer programs  i have a good command of secretarial skills  .  
 what qualifications have you got  ?  
 i have a doctor license and a driving license  .  
 do you get special training in office skills  ?  
 i passed both the cambridge examinations  first certificate and the certificate of proficiency in english  and studied for a year in london at the lucas secretarial college  ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in english shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing  .  i was also trained in office procedure  .  
 please tell me about work you have done  which qualifies you for this job  .  
have you seen our new packing specifications  ?  
how many kinds of secretaries work here  ?  
 there are 3 secretarial categories here  .  one is receptionist  one is junior secretary  and the other is senior secretary  .  
 what sort of duties do you expect  ?  
i 've been at this for two weeks now and nothing  s turned up  .  
 you 're right  .  i think it  s time to seek professional help  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i know you don  t want to pay for a job  but i think it  s time we consulted a headhunter  .  
 you  re right  i don  t want to pay  but i don  t want to live without pay  either  .  
 ha  ha  ha  !  i agree  .  that  s not much fun  .  
 do you have anyone in mind  ?  
 actually i do  .  
 who  ?  
 cooke  co  .  does a lot of placements in your field  .  
 ya  they do  .  anyone else come to mind  ?  
well  your qualifications for the job are excellent  .  and is there anything you 'd like to ask about the job  ?  
 yes  i 'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education  .  
 yes  our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses  .  
 that 's very generous  .  
 i 've enjoyed the conversation with you  .  we 'll call you within 5 working days  .  
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age  .  it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier  .  
 fully agree  .  i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel  .  the latest office equipment is more typefunctional  .  it combines fax machine  copy machine and printer in one  .  it saves a lot of place  one machine instead of three  .  
 yes  this machine is even smaller than those before  .  
 when will we get one of those  ?  
how can we get in touch with you  ?  
 please call me or send email  .  could you please let me know when your organization can make a decision  ?  
 about one week  .  
what  s up  ?  
 i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer  i can  t send out this email  .  do you have the number of the text port  ?  
 yes   .  do you mind i have a look at your computer  ?  
 of course not  i appreciate that  .  
 well  it has nothing to do with virus  .  the problem is your attachment is a bit larger  .  it has exceeded the email capacity  .  
 i see  .  what can i do now  ?  
you would be using mainly english in this job  .  do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease  ?  
 yes  i think i speak english quite fluently  .  i 've often explained historical places in xi 'an to foreign tourists in english  .  they say my english is quite good  .  
 how many years have you been learning english  ?  
 oh  more than ten years  .  i started learning english when i was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher  .  
 well  perhaps that 's the reason why you are so fluent in it  .

good morning  !  i am a new comer in our office  .  
 good morning  !  welcome to our office  !  
 nice to meet you  !  my name is grace williams  .  
 nice to meet you too  !  i am peter smith  .  
 today is my first day at work  !  
 well  hope you will enjoy your first day  !  just ask me if you need any help  .  
 thank you  .  it 's very kind of you  .  
mr  .  charles  i feel that we have had a very pleasant talk  .  
 i think so too  and you have a general understanding of the company now  .  
 yes  your company is a big one in the field and has great potential  .  
 what else do you want to know  ?  
 i want to know about the salary information in your company  .  
 then  how much do you wish to be paid each month  ?  
 i hope my starting salary will be 3000 yuan a month if i become a formal worker  .  
 we will give you more than what you hope  .  
 really  ?  that 's good news for me  .  
 you will have a sixmonth internship after you enter our company  .  during this period you can get 2500 yuan a month  and after that you can get 3500 yuan per month  .  
 it sounds great  !  
 you can also get a bonus at the end of the year  and if you can keep working in the company  your salary will get a raise every year  .  
 by the way  how many days do we work every week  ?  
 five days every week  but if it is necessary  you need to work overtime once in a while 
how good is your mandarin  ?  
 mandarin is the language i spoke since i was a child  .  so i can speak it very fluently  .  
 what dialect do you understand  ?  
do you speak a foreign language  ?  
 yes  .  i am capable of speaking english smoothly  .  i have been learning english for years  .  
 how well do you know english  ?  
jack  you should have known in general the situation of our company now  .  
 yes  and i am very satisfied with it  .  
 do you have any other questions  ?  
 would you please tell me about fringe benefits of the company  ?  
 ok  we will pay insurances for employees after the probationary period  .  
 what do they include  ?  
 include endowment insurance  medical insurance  unemployment insurance  workrelated injury insurance and maternity insurance  .  
 that sounds great  .  
 employees will also have housing payment reserve funds  .  
 the fringe benefits in your company are excellent  and it 's generous of you to offer five insurances and one fund 
 do you have other questions  ?  
 i want to know if the staff can get a vacation every year  .  
 the permanent staff can have a paid monthlong vacation every year  .  besides  they also get chances of free traveling  .  
tomorrow is my first day at work  what do you think i should be wearing  ?  
 well  if you want to look professional  serious and more conservative  a blue dress  white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice  .  but sometimes  very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues  .  it depends on the company  s dress code  .  
 indeed  i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview  .  only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony  .  it seems that their dress code is not that formal  .  probably  i should put on car key and simple shirt  .  
do you understand any other foreign languages besides english  ?  
 yes  i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself  .  
 what band did you pass in japanese language proficiency test  ?  
the language used in this multinational company is mainly about english  do you think you can manage to handle that  ?  
 yes  .  i am sure i can  .  i was an english major in college  .  
 what about your second foreign language since you were an english major  ?  
you know that this job requires frequent business travel  .  can you accept it  ?  
 yes  i can  .  
 mostly short business trips  but sometimes long ones are also needed  .  
 then how about the expenses during the trips  ?  
 the company will pay all the expenses  .  
 would you tell me where we often travel  ?  
 usually shanghai  qingdao  hong kong and so on  .  
 it 's great  !  i like these places  .  
 and you need to go abroad once in a while  .  can you  ?  
 yes  i can  .  
 after the business trip  you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses  such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on  .  
 i see  .  
 you can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time  which depends on the circumstances  .  
how is your computer skill  ?  
 my familiarity to computer is great  and i use computer frequently in my daily life and work  .  
 what kind of software can you use skillfully  ?  
do you have any certificates on computer  ?  
 yes  .  i have acre  national computer rank examination  certificate  rank ii  .  
 how did you get it  ?  
just as the saying goes  every potter praises his own pot  .  you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview  .  
 it is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time  .  
 you 'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance  in order to have a good performance in the interview  .  
 the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background  .  and the length depends on the particular situation  .  
 only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in  can you make a targeted preparation  .  
 to sell yourself successfully  you should leave the interviewer a deep impression  .  
 selling yourself should go straight to the point  and the statement should be clear and brief  .  
 it should also be truthful and realistic  .  do not blindly blow your own horn  .  
 you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for  .  
 while you should not omit your weak points  they need to be described appropriately 
 time permitted  you could add certain examples to your description  .  
besides salary what kind of allowance can i expect  ?  
 we have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis  .  
 can you elaborate it more concretely  ?  
i want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence  .  
 do n't worry about such problems  .  we can deal with them for you  .  other questions  ?  
 i have no other questions  .  thank you  .  
can we talk about the working overtime issue  ?  what  s on your mind  ?  
 yes  sure  .  to be honest  nobody would like to work overtime  .  however  we have to if it is necessary for our company  .  i would do that if it is the call of duty  .  
 glad to hear that  .  generally  it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours  .  
do i often have to work overtime  ?  
 yes  you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job  .  
 is there any extra pay for that  ?  
can you offer the five insurances for me  ?  
 yes  we have insurance against old age  medical problems  unemployment  work injury and childbirth  .  
 how are they get paid  ?  
jack  i do n't know how to write my resume  .  could you tell me about that  ?  
 you should first write your name and contact information  .  
 what does the contact information include  ?  
 such as your land line phone number  mobile phone number and email box  .  
 anything else  ?  
 then you should write your objectives  such as seeking a position in foreign trade  .  
 i see  .  it is the position desired 
 yes  .  after that you should emphasize your skills  educational background and related experience  .  
 i see  .  skills are about specialty  and educational background is easy as well  .  but what about related experience  ?  i have little work experience  .  
 do n't worry  .  it will take time to accumulate experience  .  you need to be confident for yourself  .  
 i see  .  by the way  should i write the educational background starting from elementary school  ?  
 generally from the college 
hello  this is mr  .  simon  .  may i help you  ?  
 hello  this is wang li  .  i want to know the status of the position  .  
 sorry  i ca n't give you an immediate answer on the matter  .  it 's pending now  .  
 when can i know whether i 'm accepted or not  ?  
this is mary  .  i just want to let you know that we made an offer to you  .  the salary is 3000 yuan a month  i emailed the offer to you as well  .  you can let me know within a week if you accept the offer  .  
 thank you  .  i 'll go through it and tell you  .  
 we hope you get on board with us  please let me know as soon as possible  .  
mary  besides the resume  i think we should also write an application letter  .  
 i think so  but how should we write it  ?  
 i think we should begin the letter with a salutation  and the salutation must be very formal  .  
 yes  it should be so  .  then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement  .  
 we should say we are very interested in that job  and we hope to get that job  .  
 we should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job  .  
 for example  i have mastered business english very well  and i also know a little spanish  .  
 oh  you have recommended yourself very well  .  i should think about how to recommend myself as well  .  
 you can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge  and you can communicate with others proficiently in english  .  
 yes  .  at the end  we should conclude the letter with greetings  .

i wonder if you could do me a favor  .  
 i 'd be happy to help you  .  name it  .  
 my printer is broken  .  can you print up a copy for me  ?  
 sure  no problem  .  do you want me to edit it for you  ?  
 please  you write much better than i do  .  
first  tell me about your education  please  .  
 all right  .  i graduated and got the degree of bachelor of economics from nanjing university 4 years ago  .  my major is international trade  .  
 can you name some terms of payment  ?  
have you ever been involved in the auditing work  ?  
 yes  i have  .  i was employed by the financial section of the university ever since i graduated  .  i worked there for 3 years  .  then i had worked in a bank for 3 years  .  
 how long did it take you to become an auditor  ?  
i want to find a job in your bank as an accounting clerk  .  
 do you know various funds and accounts  ?  
 yes  i enjoy working with that  .  
to start with  may i know why you are interested in working for our company  ?  
 first of all  as far as i know  your company has had impressive records in business  .  second  i want to enter the foreign trade field  .  
 what was your chief responsibility in your past work  ?  
do you have any other questions  ?  
 yes  may i ask something about the salary and benefits in your company  ?  
 according to our regulations  you will be on probation for the first three months  .  
 what is the salary while on probation  ?  
 in this period  you can only get the basic salary  2500 yuan per month  .  
 that sounds fine  .  
 the salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month  .  your salary will be raised every year in october  depending on your performance evaluation . you can get a bonus once a year . and it 's normally in december  .  
 are there paid holidays  ?  
all of you have reported your achievements  .  i 'd like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face  .  
 the same with the previous speaker  we must know how things stand with us  .  
 yes  we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition  .  
i can see by your resume here that you studied business administration  .  
 that 's right  .  
 so i wonder why you want to work for a newspaper  .  
 i did reporting for the university newspaper in my school . and i always be very interested in journalism  .  
 but journalism  it is a very different profession from administration . you know a lot about administration . why do n't you choose to work for a company looking for managers  ?  
 i study the administration . yes . but i 'm more attracted to writing articles  .  i want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news  .  
 a new reporter must expect to work many hours  .  
first of all  thank you for accepting this job  .  
 it  s my pleasure  .  
 what are your salary expectations  ?  
 would you please tell me about your pay skill first  ?  
 we  ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with  in addition  we offer one percent commission and all your sales  .  you also enjoy life insurance and health insurance  .  what  s starting salary would you expect here  ?  
 they sum my skills and experience  .  i  d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month  .  
 that sounds reasonable  .  
 do i have paid vacation  ?  
why have you decided to change jobs  ?  
 i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking  i really hope to work at a bank  .  
 then  why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai  ?  
 because your bank is a new one  i think i 'll be given more opportunities  and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here  .  
 it certainly is  .  but the work is also hard here  .  you need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field  .  
 i expect to work hard  madam  .  
 do you mind going on frequent business traps  ?  
that is what we are pursuing  .  
 we look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations  .  
 a meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff  .

good afternoon  mr  .  yang  .  i 'm jill  mr  .  smith 's secretary  .  would you like to look around the factory first  ?  
 yes  i would  .  
 now this is our office block  .  we have all the administrative departments sales  accounting  personnel  market research and so on  .  
 what 's that building opposite us  ?  
 that 's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored  .  we keep a stock of the fastmoving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock  .   in the workshop  this is one of our three workshops  .  this is the delivery bay here  .  
 oh  i see  .  
 the steel sheets and bars come in  as you see  in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here  .  we buy them in from a steel works in wales  .  this is the new conveyor belt we installed last year  .  we doubled our output in this department as a result  .  
 oh  really  ?  
have you worked out the offers  .  mr  .  thou  ?  
 yes  we have  .  here 's our cif quotation sheet  .  please have a careful look  .  
 are the prices on the list firm offers  ?  
 yes  .  all the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation  .  
 i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices  .  
 all these products are our bestselling lines  .  the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand  .  and we are always open to negotiate  especially on larger orders  .  what do you have in mind  ?  
 how long does your offer remain valid  ?  i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan  .  
hello  mr  .  thomas  .  could you spare a minute  ?  
 what do you need  ?  
 i need to talk to you about that new driver you  ve hired  .  i think i am going to have some problems working with him  .  
look  here is a very special business card from an illustrator  .  every time i go through my book of business cards  i will notice it  .  it is an eyecatching one  .  
 wow  fantastic  .  i like the font and color for his name  .  it is creative yet personal  .  
 yes  it is a bold design  .  people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card  .  it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations  .  
congratulations  !  i heard that you are going to take a twoweek training course in the headquarter  .  
 thank you  .  i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new  .  you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast  .  
 sure it is  .  this is a changing world  .  does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month  ?  they are very useful for us  .  
 yes  according to the agenda  there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course  .  
 well  good for you  .  i hope you can get what you want from the training  .  
what  s the problem  ?  things are getting out of hand  .  you keep sticking your nose where it doesn  t belong  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
what is your most preferred training method  ?  
 well  i prefer active rather than passive training  .  for example  i like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin  .  they sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice  .  all employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room  so we could communicate with each other  .  we had a lot of fun learning together  .  it helps to build up the work relation among colleagues  .  
 well  that is also very efficient  right  ?  
 of course  it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet  .  
have you heard that we will have reorganization  ?  
 no  really  ?  
 yes  flexible  aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department  .  
 who will be there  ?  
 james is going to be packed off there  .  
the boss had an informal discussion with me this morning  i feel really down  .  
 what  s up  ?  
 well  actually i failed to meet a deadline last week and i forgot to answer an email for a vip customer yesterday  .  
 anything that distracts you from work  ?  
 yes  everything  .  i feel overwhelmed by the daily work  .  sometimes  i just can  t focus on what i am doing  .  what is worse  though i make plans for a whole week  i always have to make changes later on because other things come up  .  i can  t manage my time well  .  i can  t handle work well  .  i am afraid i was screw up more things  .  
 look  lucy  .  things are not so bad as you said  .  this is our company  s busiest time in a year  .  you need to relax a little  .  don  t push yourself too hard  ok  ?  
how do you think a manager should react to an employee  s unsatisfactory work  ?  
 if i were a manager  i would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons  .  it is very important to have this onetoone discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction  .  
 exactly  i overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning  they were from the company on the 12th floor  i guess  .  they were only three of us in the elevator  i felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them  .  
 well  i guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry  .  anyway  it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others  especially strangers  .  
some companies use to ban dating among employees  but now they have realized it is something in avertable  .  people spend so much time at work  .  it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other  .  
 if we think positively  office love can be beneficial to company  .  
 beneficial  ?  i don  t think so  .  if two employees get married  they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon  or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies  .  if they break up  the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable  .  by any means  the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating  .  
 but if two employees are in love  they will be happy  .  happy people are more productive  .  if they develop an intimate relation with each other  they are willing to share knowledge and experience  .  it can help to improve work efficiency  .  
how would you describe your relationship with our boss  ?  
 we have a fairly good working relationship  but there was also a rough spot  .  
 what do you think his strengths are  ?  
what kind of personality do you think you have  ?  
 i 'm quite active and energetic  .  i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone  .  
 do you think you are introverted or extroverted  ?  
 i 'm quite outgoing i think  .  i enjoy mixing and doing things with others  .  
 what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy  ?  
 i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends  .  a person ca n't live all by himself i think  .  a friend in need is a friend in deed . the more really close friends i have  the better  .  
 what kind of people do you like to work with  ?  
which university did you graduate from  ?  
 i graduated from peking university  .  
 what was your major at university  ?  
 i studied economics  i am especially interested in the economic development of china  .  
 what course did you like best  ?  
 i like business management  and i think it 's very useful for the present work  .  
 what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking  ?  
now please tell me something about your past work achievements  .  
 all right  madam  .  when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store  .  i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25  and profit margins from 50  to 80   .  
 that is quite an achievement  !  do you consider it your most rewarding work experience  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  i 'll create further achievement in the future  .  
 have you received any honors  ?  
 yes  .  i got the title of  advance worker  in 2006  .  
 do you have any publications  ?  
how many languages can you speak  ?  
 besides chinese  i can speak english and french  .  
 you mean you can read and write both of them  ?  
 no  i can only carry on a simple conversation in french  .  
 can you read and write english well  ?  
 i can speak the language better than read and write  .  
 do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries  ?  
 i think so  .  i used to be an interpreter  .  
 do you think your english is good enough to do desk work  ?  
okay  rebecca  .  now you  ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background  but what about you as a person  ?  how would you describe your key strengths  ?  
 well  mr  .  parsons  as i mentioned before i  m someone who needs new challenges  .  i  m really focused and hardworking  .  i think my academic results prove this  .  
 yes  true  but how about other personal qualities  ?  
 well  i believe i  m a good teamplayer  but i can also work well independently  .  i  m very enthusiastic and  well i hope my colleagues would agree  i  m fun to work with  .  
 what would you say is your most positive quality  ?  
okay  now i  d like to find out more about your last job  .  i see you spent almost four years at the london weekly  is that right  ?  
 yes  that  s right  .  to be honest  the first year was quite tough for me  .  i was really just treated more like an intern  .  i didn  t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating  .  
 so  what changed  ?  
 well slowly but surely i proved myself  and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer  .  
 wow  a real step up  !  
 yes  i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly  .  i spent restaurant years in that position  but to be honest it wasn  t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm  .  
 i see  so why did you decide to leave finally  ?  
now  if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english  ?  
 yes  that  s right  .  after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk  .  my major was english  and my minor was business studies  .  i completed my ba in 2004  .  
 yes  i  m pleased to see that you also got a distinction  .  
 yes that  s right  .  i  ve always enjoyed studying  .  my friends say i  m a bit of a bookworm  but my father always pushed us to succeed school  .  
 well  it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca  .  so how about extracurricular activities at university  ?  
 well i  ve always been keen on writing  so i became the editor for the university student newspaper  which i really loved  .  also i volunteered for a group called shelter  to help the homeless in york  .  
 what did that involve  ?  
 providing warm meals and shelter  especially in the winter months  .  i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group  .  
 i  m sure  .  okay  now let  s move on to your work experience  shall we  ?  
may i help you  ?  
 yes  i 'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in english  .  
 i 'm mary kelly  .  may i ask your name  ?  
 my name is zhuang lingy  .  how are you  miss kelly  ?  
 i 'm glad to meet you  mr  .  zhuang  .  sit down  please  .  
 thank you  miss kelly  .  
 what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist  ?  
 i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute  .  
 would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test  ?  
 yes  i would  .  
 your typing and stenography are pretty good  .  would you be interested in applying for the job  ?  
 yes  i 'd like to give it a try  .  
right rebecca  .  now i see that after graduating from university your first job was  .  .  .  
 for a local paper in york called the york herald  .  actually  i started with them as an intern in the beginning  .  i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world  and this seemed like a good first step  .  
 certainly  .  and after your internship  ?  
 they seemed impressed  and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter  .  i ended up staying two years there actually  .  i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper  .  i really enjoyed it there  and it really helped me build my skills  .  
 yes i see  .  but you decided to leave them in 2006  right  ?  
 yes  that  s right  .  my husband and i moved to london  and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london  .  
 the london weekly right  ?  
now  miss childs passed on your resume to me and i  ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i  m quite impressed  .  
 thank you very much  .  i  ve tried to keep it short and clear  .  if there  s any questions please feel free to ask me  .  
 well yes  i do have a number of questions  but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i  d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background  .  
 yes  of course  .  well as you can see from the resume i  m 27 and grew up in brooklyn  new york  although our family moved to london when i was quite young  at around sixteen  .  
 ah i see  so you were actually educated in europe  ?  
 yes precisely  .  although i was born in the us  i would definitely call london home  .  but as you see i  ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country  .  my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too  .  
 very interesting  .  so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood  .  
 absolutely  !  we were never still for too long  .  but now i  m really looking to settle down  .  
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there  s something wrong with the fax machine  .  
 what  s wrong with the fax machine  ?  is it urgent  ?  
 yes  very urgent  .  and there is no other fax machine around  .  and the office of our boss is closed  so i can not use his machine either  .  and his secretary is out  .  do you have any suggestion  ?  
would you please mail these letters  lucy  ?  
 yes  sir  .  
 these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail  .  others are ordinary letters  .  
 all right  who should i send them to  ?  
 it  s sent to mr  .  charles  .  i believe he is in london  .  
 ok  home or office address  ?  
 office address  please  .  he might be at work when they arrive  .  
 should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters  ?  
look  the printer isn  t functioning well  .  i  ve pushed the start button  .  it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log  .  what  s going on  ?  
 let me check  .  it has a paper jam  .  
 i didn  t pay attention to that  .  i will try to get the paper out  .  
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules  .  
 well  all right  .  there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents  information and other things  .  
 what are they  ?  
 they are  keep the documents in chronological order  remove all the chips and pins  punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder  .  
 and what is the most important point  ?  
hello  this is francis  .  
 hi  this is monica  .  i was wondering when we can work on this financial report  .  
 today  i am busy all day long  .  
 shall i see you on friday morning  ?  
 that  s not good for me at all . it  ll have to be another time  .  
 we must find some time to read report  .  
 i know  .  i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon  .  
 that  s all right  .  then see you on friday afternoon  .  
lucy  i  d like to fix the light in the corridor  it keeps flashing  which drives me crazy  .  would you like to help me with the ladder  ?  
 monica  wait a moment  .  i think we  d better call the repair man to do it  .  
 i think i can handle it by myself  .  
 i  d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company  .  
 i see  .  if i got hurt when fixing the light  even during office hours  i wouldn  t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility  .  
 other company rules also need your attention  .  
 like this one  ?  never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah  thank you for telling me  .  
we have the orientation this afternoon  .  
 what  s going to be covered in the orientation  ?  
 the company introduction  our mission  vision  various policies  insurances  pension plan  company id  batch  telephone  email setup and training  .  
 quite a lot  .  all them one afternoon  ?  
 yes  it is not easy  .  
hello  this is lucy from abc company  .  is this monica  ?  
 yes  it is  .  
 i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon  .  please come on time  .  
 ok  thank you  .  by the way  could you please tell me how i can get there from a community  ?  
 oh  you can take the subway  get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes  .  you will find a building  .  it will take about 40 minutes in total  .  
 i got it  .  thank you so much  .  
good afternoon  .  how can i help you  ?  
 good afternoon  .  my name is monica  .  i am here for the job interview at 2 pm  .  
 ok  please first fill in the form and return it to me  .  you can do it in the next door  .  
 done  .  here is my paper  .  
 everybody attention  .  i would like to make sure you all know the process  .  the interview consists of three parts  .  one  all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour  .  two  we will take a 30  minute  s break  .  after the break  we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round  .  in which  you have a small interview with your future manager  .  
 what about the 3rd round  ?  
what  s up  ?  
 i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer  i can  t send out this email  .  do you have the number of the text port  ?  
 do you mind i have a look at your computer  ?  
 of course not  i appreciate that  .  
 well  it has nothing to do with virus  .  the problem is your attachment is a bit larger  .  it has exceeded the email capacity  .  
 i see  .  what can i do now  ?  
i  m glad you could find time to meet with me  mr  .  johnson  .  i can  t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today  the ambiance here is lovely  !  
 no problem  if possible i always combine business with pleasure  .  now  let  s hear more about these chocolates you  re offering  .  
 well  as you know  i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states  .  they  re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market  .  naturally  your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately  .  i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant  luxurious  first class dining  .  
 mmmm  sounds interesting  .  .  .  gourmet chocolates  where are they produced  ?  belgium  ?  
 actually  the factory is located in scotland  .  
 really  ?  i didn  t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production  .  .  .  
 that  s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity  !  the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units  .  they  ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well  .  here  i brought these especially for you  try one  !  
 oh  thanks  .  mmm  hmm  creamy texture  very smooth  .  .  .  
 unique  aren  t they  ?  i bet you  ve never tasted anything like it  !  quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one  s cutting corners with the ingredients  .  only the creme make it through inspection  .  
 yes  very interesting flavors  .  .  .  slightly spicy  very unique  that  s for sure  .  exactly what are the ingredients  ?  
 i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations  .  i  m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk  cacao beans  sugar and haggis  .  
 haggis  ?  what  s haggis  ?  
hello  .  is this ann  ?  
 yes  it is  .  kelly  ?  
 yes  it 's me  .  
 do you have a cold  ?  
 no  .  worse than that  .  i have a flu  .  i 'm in bed with a fever  .  
 oh  no  !  what about your presentation today  ?  
 i 'd like to do it  of course  .  but i just ca n't  .  i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it  .  
 i understand  .  what should i tell mr  .  morley  ?  
 why not just tell him i 'm sick  ?  i 'll ring him myself this afternoon  .  
 alright  .  have you been to see a doctor  ?  
 not yet  .  i feel too lousy to go out . anyway  i have a flu  .  i know what it is  .  i do n't need a doctor to tell me that  .  
 do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow  ?  or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too  ?  
 i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day  .  so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments  .  i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think  .  
 it 's rainy weather today  .  maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep  .  
 yes  that 's what i plan to do  .  except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it  .  
 that bad  huh  ?  
 yeah  i 'm very nauseous  .  it 's mostly nausea and a fever  .  
 well  i 'll cancel your appointments for today  .  and i 'll tell mr  .  morley  .  
 thanks  ann  .  talk to you this afternoon  .  
excuse me  sir  this is the express checkout lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer  .  it looks like you have more than fifteen items there  .  
 oh  come on  !  i have sixteen items  !  cut me some slack  will ya  ?  
 fine  !  please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through  .  do you prefer paper or plastic  ?  
 plastic  .  i also have a couple of coupons  .  
 no problem  i  ll take those  .  sir  these coupons expired yesterday  .  
 darn  !  oh  well  .  i guess it  s just not my day  .  thanks anyway  .  
 do you have a club card or will it be cash  ?  
 yeah i got a club card  .  here you go  .  
 will this be debit or credit  ?  
 debit please  .  also  could i get cash back  ?  fifty dollars would be great  .  
and so  i just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project  .  as you know  you  ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week  and this will negativity impact the team  s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project  .  
 i know  i  m really sorry that i missed the deadline  .  but really  it wasn  t my fault  .  you see  we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute  and that i couldn  t get into the database and extract the kind of information that i needed for the data analysis  .  you know  if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the arm stable  then i wouldn  t have missed my deadline  .  
 oh  come on  !  an excuse like that is tantamount to lying  .  you  re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues  rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks  .  
 no  i  m not trying to pass the buck here  i know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done  .  but the thing is  i could have finished on time if the system hadn  t gone down  .  and you know  with everything i  ve got going on now  i can  t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems  .  i  ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twentyfour hours in a day  .  .  .  
our advertisement says english competence is a key requirement of this position  .  then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken english  ?  
 i have learned english for 10 years  and i have passed college english test band 4 and 6 . my spoken english is fairly good enough to express myself fluently  .  
 what other foreign language do you speak  ?  
i know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years  can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us  ?  
 because the job i am doing in my present company is of no challenge  but i like challenge . your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas  .  it has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago  .  working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge i am looking for  .  
 why do you think you are qualified for this position  ?  
which school are you attending  ?  
 i am attending hebes university of technology  .  
 when will you graduate from that university  ?  
 this coming july  .  
 what degree will you receive  ?  
 i will receive a bachelor 's degree  .  
 what is your major  ?  
 my major is business administration  .  
 how have you been getting on with your studies so far  ?  
 i have been doing quite well at college  .  according to the academic records i 've achieved so far  i am confident that i will get my bachelor of business administration this coming july  .  
 how do you think the education you 've received will contribute to your work in this institution  ?  
which university did you graduate from  ?  
 i graduated from hebes university  .  
 what subject did you major in at university  ?  
 i majored in economics  .  
 tell me about the courses of your major in university  .  
 i take more than 50 courses in university  including microeconomics  macroeconomics  marketing principles  sales management  statistics  and so on  .  
 how did you get on with your studies in university  ?  
 i did well in university  .  i was one of the top students in the class  .  
 what subject did you minor in  ?  
well  i  ve looked over your resume  mr  .  peepers  .  
 please  call me ted  .  
 well  ted  this is a very impressive resume  .  however  we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision  .  we  ll call you by friday  if that  s all right  .  
 that  s no problem  .  
 do you have any other questions  ?  
 well  what kind of salary do you provide  ?  
 salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company  .  
 i see  .  
 salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job  .  
have you received any degrees  ?  
 yes  .  in 1996 i received my bachelor of science degree from hebes university  and in 2001 i received my mba degree from peking university  .  
 how about your academic records at college  ?  
 in fact my records were excellent  .  my overall gpa was 9 on a 10 scale  which was the highest in my class  .  
 that 's very impressive  .  which course did you like best  ?  
 english  .  it was both interesting and useful  so i showed a great interest in it  .  
 can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student  ?  
 because i am very interested in administration and i did take some courses in it  .  i also performed well in the subjects  .  hence i believe that i can do a good job in this position  .  
 did you get any honors and awards at college  ?  
i 'm afraid we ca n't increase salary this year  money is just too title  .  
 i 'm not sure i ca n't agree  dan 
 why not  ?  
 surely  there are other ways to save money  .  
so  are we all behind this new project  ?  
 i 'm in favor of maggie  .  
 ditto  it does n't look too expensive either  .  
 that 's right  nigel  .  i think we can keep cost down  .  
i am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation  .  i hope we can do business together  .  
 it 's a great pleasure to meet you  mr  .  white  .  i believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom  .  what is it that particularly interests you  ?  
 i am interested in your hardware  .  i 've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues  .  i think some of the items will find a ready market in france  .  here is a list of requirements  .  
 thank you for your inquiry  .  would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer  ?  
 i will do that  .  meanwhile  could you give me an indication of the price  .  
 here are our fob price lists  .  all the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation  .  
 what about the commission  ?  from european suppliers  i usually get a 3 to 5  commission for my imports  .  it 's the general practice  .  
 as a rule we do n't allow any commission  .  but if the order is sizable one  we will consider it  .  
 you see i do business on a commission basis  .  a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales  .  even 2 or 3  would help  .  
hello  mr  .  black  how are you  ?  
 fine  thank you  and how are you  ?  
 very well  thank you  .  it 's nice to meet you again  .  i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport  as i was busy yesterday  .  i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york  .  
 yes  a very pleasant journey indeed  .  thank you  .  
 how are you getting along with your business  ?  
 not bad  .  the fur market is not very brisk lately  but the selling season is advancing near  .  i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year  .  
hi  dan  .  what 's new  ?  
 where have you been  ?  i 've been trying to get in touch with you for two days  .  
 i went to salt lake city on business  .  what 's up  ?  
 i got fired  .  
 how come  ?  last time i saw you  .  you told me it was a good job  and you 'd like to take it as a career  .  that was only one month ago  .  why this sudden change  ?  
 it 's a long story  .  in a word  i did n't do a good job of it  .  i messed up a business deal  a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up  .  
 what are you going to do now  ?  
 i am trying to find a job asap  .  lily does n't know yet  .  i did n't tell her  .  i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office  and she thought i went to work as usual  .  
 that 's not the way to solve the problem  .  did you look in the classified advertisements column  ?  
 yes  i did  .  but i was n't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in  .  
 listen  .  i will see what i can do  ok  ?  you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now  .  she is your wife and i am sure she will understand  .  
good morning  .  could i speak to frans smith please  ?  
 frans smith  ?  i think you may have the wrong number  .  
 is this taiwan 8234342 2  ds engineering  ?  
 it is  .  but there is no frans smith here  .  do you know which department he works in  ?  
 the accounts department  i think  .

 please take a seat  diana  .  have you got your spare pens and pencils  ?  
 yes  i have this time  .  but if i do n't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating  can i ask you halfway  ?  
 no  i  d prefer not  .  i do n't want any interruptions every other minute  but you can ask me at the end of the letter  .  
 all right  .  i understand now  .  do you think i should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments  .  
 of course  diana  .  you 'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it  .  
 certainly i will  mr  .  robbins  .  by the way  may i use a window envelope  ?  
 yes  that 's fine  .  now when you finish these  i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order  using the last names  and then make a list  .

when are you going to give me those brochures  ?  
 what  s the rush  ?  you  re not leaving for another week  .  
 i know  but i want to make reservations this week  .  
hey  could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview  ?  
 the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides  .  do you know all about them  ?  
 yes  i pretty much understand the company  .  
 well  after you 've done your research  you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal  .  have you decided what they are yet  ?  
 yes  i 've been observing them  .  
 when you are choosing what to wear  keep all of that in mind  .  have you chosen what to wear  ?  
 i already have something to wear  .  
 i would always be ready to go shopping with you  !  should we talk about other basics  ?  
 ok  i am ready to think of other things  .  
i am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview  .  
 make sure that you understand the company  .  do you understand what it is that they do  ?  
 no  i probably need to do some more research  .  
 when you 've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed  .  does that make sense  ?  
 i think that their attitude is rather casual  .  
 so all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear  .  do you have something to wear  ?  
 i have absolutely nothing so far  .  
 you know i could go shopping with you sometime if you need it  but can we talk about other basics  ?  
 yes  where should we go from here  ?  
richard  ?  do you have the number for that chinese restaurant on the corner  ?  
 yeah  hold on a second  .  i  ve got it in my office  .  here it is  .  5532213  .  
 5532213  .  great  thanks  .  
thank you so much for interviewing me this evening  .  
 happy to meet with you  .  now  do you prefer group projects  ?  
 i like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group  .  
 do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead  ?  
 i want to grow in my job and move ahead  .  
 could you work for us in another state  if need be  ?  
 i need to stay in the area because of my family  .  
 how much do you need to make per year  ?  
 75000 per year  .  
are there any special unemployment forms i need to fill out  ?  
 you need to get a special application form  .  
 do you know where i can find the application form  ?  
 you can go to the employment development office and pick it up  .  
 what records will i have to show to apply for unemployment benefits  ?  
 they will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them  .  
 is there anything else i will need to provide  ?  
 be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof  .  
 do i need to do anything else after i turn in the application  ?  
how do i know if i qualify for unemployment benefits  ?  
 are you working fewer hours than you used to work  ?  
 i got laid off  .  
 you usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours  .  
 do all jobs provide unemployment  ?  
 most jobs provide unemployment  but some don  t  .  
 do you think that my job pays unemployment  ?  
 you can call your unemployment office  and they can check for you  .  
 will i be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment  ?  
can i collect unemployment benefits  ?  
 are you still working  ?  
 my employer cut back on my hours  .  
 if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours  you may qualify  .  
 do i definitely get to collect unemployment  ?  
 not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance  so their employees cannot collect benefits  .  
 how do i check out my status to collect unemployment  ?  
 you should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck  .  check your pay stubs  .  
 how much will my unemployment check be  ?  
what forms should i fill out to collect unemployment  ?  
 you need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits  .

 you can call the employment development office and request a form  .  
 what information will i need to provide to apply for unemployment  ?  
 be prepared to provide your employer  s name and address and what dates you worked  .  
 what else will the employment development office need  ?  
 you need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault  .  if you have a termination notice  that would be great  .  
 what will happen next  ?  
how do i know what forms to fill out for unemployment  ?  
 there is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits  .  
 how do i get the form to apply for unemployment benefits  ?

 what type of information will i have to provide to the employment development office  ?  
 you need to be able to say whom you worked for and when  .  
 will they need anything else from me  ?  
 you should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance  .  
 what should i do after i turn in the application  ?  
i was wondering if you could go over the services available at edd to help me get a job  .  
 the best opportunity is called callous  which is an internetbased job placement service that you can make use of  .  
 do i have to have a computer at home  ?  
 there are computers at our edd offices for you to use in your job search  .  
 do you have any other services available  ?  
 we have information available about the job market as well as workshops  .  
 what kinds of workshops are available at the edd  ?  
 we have workshops in resume writing and interviewing  to name a few  .  
 are there other places  outside of edd  that i may look for work  ?  
i haven  t seen you in a while  .  how have you been  ?  
 things are going fairly well  .  how about you  ?  
 well  i  m hanging in there  but i lost my job and need to find another one quickly  .  
 i am looking for a job myself  .  what were you thinking of doing next  ?  
 i am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by  .  
 have you gotten any interviews yet  ?  
 no  i haven  t been out on one interview yet  .  
 have you thought about the electrician program over there  ?  
 i think that i might be interested in that position  .  
after i am accepted for unemployment benefits  what will happen next  ?  
 you will receive a notice of unemployment insurance award letter  .  
 what will that tell me  ?  
 the award letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly  .  
 are there any other forms that i need to fill out  ?  
 you will need to fill out a continued claim form every two weeks  .  
 what information will i need to provide on that form  ?  
 they will need to know where you worked and how much money you made  .  
 are there any other questions on the form  ?  
hi  !  how are things going with you  ?  
 i am doing well  .  what  s up with you  ?  
 believe it or not  the company i worked for closed down  so i  m out of a job  .  
 the same with me  .  have you given much thought to what you want to do next  ?  
 i am not being all that particular right now because i just need to keep a roof over my head  .  
 how about interviews  ?  have you been on any of those yet  ?  
 i wish that i could get the opportunity to be interviewed  .  
 how about the electrician program that they have listed over there  ?  
 i read about that  and the position sounded great  !  
what should i do when i find a job  ?  
 there are a few considerations  .  is this a parttime or fulltime job  ?  
 does it make a difference  ?  
 basically  you really don  t need to do much of anything  .  on the continued claim form  you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning  .  
 if i get work for a few weeks  will i be terminated from edd  ?  
welcome to iba  .  do you need any assistance  ?  
 yes  please  .  i 'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates  .  
 i see  .  we offer personal housing loans  or mortgages  at a rate of 0 . 42  per month  .  
 that 's pretty much the same as i 've been quoted at other banks  .  
 we offer many different payment plans  .  would you be looking at longterm or shortterm  ?  are you looking at a 10  year repayment plan  ?  
 definitely  .  i want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as i can  .  
 then we can certainly help you with that  .  you see  for shorter term loans  we can offer an even more competitive interest rate  .  
 mmmm  .  .  .  that does sound interesting  .  is there anyone available i can talk with about this in more detail  ?  
may i help you at all  ?  
 yes  please  .  my son wants to go overseas  to england  to do his master degree  .  i wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so  ?  
 we certainly do  .  i can give you some details about a loan called personal loan for studying abroad  .  we offer this to anyone who will study outside this country  .  
 i see  .  what does it entail  ?  i 'm not sure if we will be eligible  .  
 this loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items  .  
 so  we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses  not just his tuition  ?  
 that 's right  .  the sundries could include accommodation  text books and so on  .  the guidelines are not so strict  you see  .  
good day  !  what can we do for you  ?  
 i 'm considering buying a new car  the old one has n't been running too well recently  and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me  .  
 buying a new car is a big expense  we understand that  so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs  .  
 that 's great  .  i 'm looking to borrow quite a large sum  though  .  
 with our personal automobile consumer loan  the borrower can borrow up to 80  of the purchase price  .  
 that 's good news  .  the car i 'm interested in is priced at 120000 rib  but i think i can get a bit of discount on that  .  i can afford to put up around 40000 rib myself  .  
 that 's great  .  you will need to make an initial down payment of 20   and then we can get going with this  .  
personal loans  how may i help  ?  
 i 'm going to be studying overseas next year and i 'd like some info about suitable loans  .  to be honest  i 'm not even sure if i can get a loan  .  
 not a problem  .  we offer a personal loan for studying abroad for anyone who 's studying overseas  regardless of the circumstances  .  anyone is eligible to apply 
 would i have to get my parents to guarantor the loan  ?  
 not exactly  .  our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad  for example  you  or your direct relative or spouse  .  
 i see  .  what about age limitations  ?  
 there are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course  old enough to get a loan  meaning over 18 years of age  .  
welcome to lincoln bank  .  what can we do for you today  ?  
 hello  .  i called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan  .  she said to come in as soon as i had the chance  as this must be done in person  .  i 'd like to apply today  .  
 ok  that 's absolutely fine  .  i will need to see some credentials before we can get started  .  do you have the notification of admission letter from your university  your passport and your visa with you  ?  
 yes  yes  .  it 's all here  .  there you go  .  i 'm not sure if i need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan  do i  ?  
 you do  i 'm afraid  .  there are 3 ways to do this  .  you can choose  mortgage  pledge or guarantee mode  .  
 yes  i read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me  .  i 'd like to go for the guarantee mode  please  .  
 right  that 's no problem  .  i see you are already well informed  .  if you choose that one  you can borrow up to 70  of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees  .  
did you need help with something  ?  
 i don  t know where to get my ballot  .  
 i can help you with that  .  
 how can you help me  ?  
 i work here  .

 they do  ?  
 you  ll be okay  .  
 thanks for telling me  .  
will you be voting this year  ?  
 of course  !  will you  ?  
 this is going to be my first time voting  .  
 are you serious  ?  
 i  m not sure what i  m doing  .  
 voting is easy  .  
 i don  t know anything about the bills or laws they  re trying to pass  .  
 the ballot gives you all that information  .  
 nobody told me that before  .  
 you have nothing to worry about  .  
 i  m so glad you told me that  .  
i am really excited  !  
 why are you so excited  ?  
 i just got done voting  .  
 this was your first time voting  wasn  t it  ?  
 i just turned 18 last month  .  
 that is so lucky of you  .  
 why  ?  
 you turned 18 a month before the election  .  
 i didn  t think of it that way  .  
 are you serious  ?  
 seriously  but i  m excited that i did  .  
what is your case against the police  ?  
 they arrested me for nothing  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 they weren  t supposed to arrest me  .  
 didn  t they let you go  ?  
 they didn  t let me go until the next morning  .  
 so they kept you at the station  ?  
 they sure did  .  
 did they tell you why they arrested you  ?  
 i matched the description of a robbery suspect  .  
 i understand  .  
what case do you have against the police  ?  
 i want to take them to court for arresting me  .  
 i don  t understand  .  
 there was no reason for them to arrest me  .  
 they let you go  didn  t they  ?  
 they released me the next morning  .  
 they detained you at the station  ?  
 that  s exactly what they did  .  
 why did they arrest you  ?  
 they said i matched the description of a robber  .  
 i get it now  .  
have you seen the news today  ?  
 not yet  .  what happened  ?  
 did you know there was a blackout last night  ?  
 yes  i heard the lights were out all night  .  
 well  some people decided to loot last night  .  
 i do n't understand  .  
 they took advantage of the blackout  .  
 they really started looting  ?  
 yes  apparently four stores were broken into  .  
 did the looters get caught  ?  
 there was no evidence of who did it  .  
did you see the news today  ?  
 i have n't had a chance to see it  .  
 you know about the blackout last night  right  ?  
 the lights were out everywhere  .  
 a bunch of people went looting last night  .  
 they what  ?  
 they took full advantage of the lights being out  .  
 that 's crazy  .  
 the news reported that four stores were broken into  .  
 were the looters found  ?  
 the police do n't know who did it  .  
have you watched today 's news  ?  
 no  i have n't  .  what 's going on  ?  
 did you hear about last night 's blackout  ?  
 yes  .  the lights were out all night  .  
 some people went looting because of the blackout  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 people decided to use the blackout to their advantage  .  
 people went out and looted  ?  
 i guess they broke into about four stores  .  
 did the police find who did it  ?  
 there 's no evidence of who it was  .  
i need order in the court  !  
 i am ready to make my plea  .  
 what do you plead  ?  
 i plead not guilty  .  
 all the evidence indicates that you are guilty  .  
 i realize that  but i am not guilty  .  
 is that right  ?  
 i had nothing to do with the crime that was committed  .  
 who is the guilty party  ?  
 i  ll tell you if you let me go  .  
 i  d be glad to make a deal with you  .  
they do n't really think you took it  do they  ?  
 i do n't know  .  i just know i 've never been asked so many questions in my life  .  
 how many of them were there  ?  
 threebut there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions  .  
 like what  ?  
 oh  he wanted to know what time i got up this morning and if i bad a bath or a shower you know  things like that  .  
 what on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing  ?  
 i 've no idea  .  oh yes  and the most ridiculous thing  .  he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning  .  
 oh well  that 's it  .  they obviously think you 're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat  .  i should think you 'll get thirty years  .  
good evening  sir  .  i understand that you have been robbed  .  
 i certainly have  .  
 when did this happen  ?  
 about two hours ago  .  
 why did n't you report it before  ?  
 i could n't  .  i was bound and gagged  .  
 please tell me exactly what happened  .  
 i was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door  .  without thinking  i opened it  .  
 that was n't very wise  sir  .  
 i know  .  i was expecting my wife  you see  and thought it was her  .  
 you should never open a door without looking to see who it is  .  
 yes  i know  .  i regret it very much  .  
 what happened  ?  
 two men pushed into the flat  .  one of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me  .  
 did you get a good look at them  ?  
 i 'm afraid not  .  they were both wearing stockings over their faces  .  
 what did they take  ?  
 my wallet  with  200 in it  my wrist watch . some of my wife 's jewellery from our bedroom  and a silver photoframe  .  
 they do n't seem to have done much damage to the flat  .  
 no  .  they had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark  .  theran off then leaving me bound and gagged  .  it was some time before my wifereturned and released me  .  i phoned the police at o 
do you believe in god  ?  
 not at all  .  i  m an agnostic  .  do you  ?  
 i  m not sure  .  why don  t you believe there is a god  ?  
 i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one  .  
 i basically believe in science over theology  .  i mean  i believe in evolution for example  .  however  there are many things that science hasn  t explained yet  .  
 i  m sure that science will explain everything eventually  .  i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong  .  
 for example  ?  
 religions preach tolerance  but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics  .  
have you every belonged to a political party  ?  
 no  i haven  t  but i thought about joining the green party  .  
 really  ?  i know you are very concerned about the environment  .  you were a member of the pressure group greenpeace  weren  t you  ?  
 yes  .  i was  .  but i didn  t have enough time to devote to it  .  
 the green party have no chance of winning an election  .  the other parties are too big and popular  .  
 you  re right  .  but smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties  .  any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness 
 most people are not very politically aware  .  they often don  t understand the issues fully  .  
good afternoon  .  can i be of service  ?  
 i do n't know  .  can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter  ?  
 yes  of course  .  we have treasury notes with two  three and fiveyear terms available  .  
 two years is fine  with a value of 1000 rib  .  
 ok  could i take a look at some id please  like a passport  ?  
 here you go  .  by the way  is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up  ?  
what can i do for you  ?  
 hello  there  .  i 've just started using your net banking and i 'm looking for some information about my commission fund  .  
 i see  .  the fund trading system of our net banking deals with both trading and information  .  if you use this system  you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds  .  you can also get lots of other useful information  .  
 regarding what exactly  ?  
hello  madam  .  what can i do for you today  ?  
 hello  .  yes  i 'm here to redeem a treasury note  .  it 's not at the maturity date yet  but it is an emergency  .  
 ok  can i see the note and some id  please  ?  
 there you are  .  as you can see  the maturity is n't up yet  .  
 you do realise that you must pay a 0 . 2  charge for premature cancellation  right  ?  
 oh  really  ?  no  i was n't aware of that  .  
hello there  sir  .  i 've dealt with you before  have n't i  ?  
 you remember me  !  yes  i 'm with li wang enterprises  i 'm the accountant peters  .  
 yes  of course  mr peters  !  good to see you again  .  what can we do for you today  ?  
 well  we 've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you  .  we are particularly interested in agent services  .  
do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this  ?  
 actually  yes i do  .  i was wondering about the subscription fee  .  and how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund  ?  
 the subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1 . 2   .  but for redeeming  a rate of a usual 0 . 5   we shall charge you 1 . 6  if you apply to buy it after the fundraising period  .  
 so  it 's going to cost me then  ?  
hi there  .  do you need any help  ?  
 i 've been told about something called southern fund  .  how can i buy it  ?  
 first of all  you should open a fund account with us  just fill in this form  .  we 'll need to see some id and your cash card  .  
 that sounds simple enough  .  do you charge any admin fees for that  ?  
 you 'll have to pay 20 rib  and then you will have your southern fund management company card  .  
 do you need any other documentation from me  ?  
may i help you  ?  
 yes  .  i 'm sorry  but i 've lost my passbook  .  
 well  .  can you tell me how much you have deposited  ?  
 about rib 12000  .  
 please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it  .  
 i 'm bob brown  .  but i ca n't recall my account number  .  
 do n't worry  mr  .  brown  .  let me try to check it for you  .  one moment  please  .  yes  i have your account number here  .  the balance is exactly rib 12000 
 thank goodness  .  it is still there  .  thank you very much  .  
 it 's my pleasure  .  please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account  .  
hi  .  is there anything i can do for you  ?  
 hello  yes  i opened an l  c with you recently  .  we opened it 7 days ago  .  
 if you could show me your details  please  .  what can i do  ?  
 we would like to amend it  please  .  
 we can amend it for you as long as your customer agrees to the amendment  .  
 it 's all agreed  here 's a letter to prove it  .  
i want to send some money to australia  .  could you handle it for me  ?  
 yes  madam  how much would you like to remit  ?  
 2000 ad   .  
 which would you like to remit  by mail or by cable  ?  
 what is the difference between them  ?  
 the cable will take less time for your account  in the meantime  the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one  .  
 well  i think the cable is better  .  
 ok  please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary  your name and telephone  .  
 all right  .  here you are  .  
 everything is ok  .  the commission is 50 yuan  .  
i want to send some money to nanchang  .  is it handled here  ?  
 yes  sir  .  how much would you like to remit  ?  
 i want to remit 1200 yuan to my brother in nanchang  .  
 no problem  .  do you want the money to go by m  t or t  t  ?  
 what 's the difference  ?  
 if you take m  t  it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money  .  
 ok  .  i 'll take t  t  .  
 would you please fill in this application form  ?  
 all right  .  here it is  .  
 for 1200 yuan to nanchang  the commission is 12 yuan  .  
 here you are  .  thanks  .  
 you are welcome  .  
we 'd better cover the porcelain ware against all risks  .  
 all right  .  our insurance coverage is 110  of the invoice value  up to the port of destination only  .  
 i 'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130  of the invoice amount  .  
 ok  this premium for the difference between 130  and 110  of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer  .  
i am afraid i have some bad news for you  .  it 's about our order contract o5tswal  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 the goods arrived half a month later than scheduled  .  what 's more  five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged  .  
 really  ?  that 's something unexpected  .  you see  all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment  .  the goods were in perfect condition when they left  .  
 but then there were some cracks in a number of cases  .  almost all the bottom of the cases were loose  .  
 that could have happened in the course of transit or unloading  due to rough handling  .  
 but our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing  .  
 but there is nothing wrong with our packing  .  our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps  .  
 but you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough  .  when they were rehandled  some of them were broken  .  
what 's your main range  ?  
 generally speaking  we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies  size 19  21  23  25 and 27 inches  .  we can vary the colors according to the buyer 's requirements  .  here are the catalogues and the pattern books  .  they will give you a rough idea about our products  .  
 i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles  .  i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada  .  but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product  .  
 to be reliable is the strong point of our products  .  as a matter of fact  it 's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices  .  flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price  .  
i am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality  .  could you quote us for the order with neutral cases  ?  
 i am afraid not  .  we usually design the label ourselves  .  you know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods  .  
 in that case  we 'd like you to make some changes in the labeling  .  
 what are they  ?  
 first  the languages on the label should be in both english and french  .  second  the red color does n't suit our national customs  .  could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish  ?  
 that can be easily done  .  is there anything else  ?  
 the brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed  but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel  .  
 we 'll get the factory to meet your requirements  .  
welcome to china  mr  .  white  .  
 how do you do  ms  .  chi  ?  
 welcome to this corporation  mr  .  white  .  won  t you please sit down  ?  
 thank you  .  
 our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the oct  .  exhibition there  .  now we 'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind  .  
 yes  we have  .  i  ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we  d like to import for the second half of this year  .  here is a copy of it  .  
 good  .  well  mr  .  white  most of the items listed are available this year  .  i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery  .  
 i hope so  too  .  now i 'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles  .  
 here are our catalog and price list  .  the catalog lists all the commodities we export  and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles  .  
 thank you  ms chi  .  what are your normal export terms  ?  
 we normally export cfr  .  
 what commission do you usually pay for your exports  ?  as you know  we import on commission basis  .  
 that can be discussed  .  
 all right  .  when can we meet again for more specific details  ms chi  ?  
 what about tomorrow morning at 9  ?  i 'll come over to your hotel  .  
what arrangement will you make about payment  ?  
 we shall open an irrevocable l  c to cover our shipment from shanghai to hamburg  .  is it at sight or after sight  ?  
 at sight of course  .  
 some customers demand that 80  of the credit amount be paid at sight  and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial  .  
 i am afraid that ca n't be done  .  we have never done business on such terms  .  
 but such terms are quite common in the machinery trade  .  other suppliers are offering better terms  .  some even allow payment 60days after sight  .  
 we ask for full payment at sight  because we guarantee 90  mechanical efficiency for all our products  .  you do n't have the same guarantee from other suppliers  .  the usual percentage is around 85  .  
 that 's true  .  i 'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation  .  
 yes  .  we usually send technicians abroad to offer aftersales service to our customers  .  
 if you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly  and if you provide aftersales service  we agree to make the payment in full  .  
if i remember correctly  time of delivery is another point on wich we differ  .  
 that 's right  .  let 's go into the details  .  
 ok  .  i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of sep  .  we 'd like them to be there in time for our christmas sales  .  
 christmas does n't come until almost the end of the year  right  ?  
 but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before dec  .  25  .  
 well  .  i am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment  .  our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment  .  
 i hope you 'll try to get them to step up production  .  
 as new orders keep pouring in  the workers are working three shifts to step up production  .  
 if that 's the case  there is nothing more to be said  .  
 i am sorry  .  
 what 's your last word as to the date then  ?  
 i said by the middle of oct  .  this is the best we can promise  .  
 all right  .  i 'll take you at your word  .  
 good  .  let 's call it a deal  .  we will do our best to advance the shipment  but your l  c should be opened early sep  .  
the order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment  .  if shipment is too late  we 'll have to turn to other suppliers  .  
 i am sorry  but we ca n't advance shipment  .  the manufacturers are fully committed  .  they have no stock on hand  .  
 can you find some way for an earlier delivery  ?  
 how 's this then  ?  we propose partial shipment  .  we can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready  .  
 sounds like a good idea  .  
 we propose to deliver 50  in june and the balance in aug  .  
i 've come about your wools  .  according to our market survey  wools are likely to find a ready market in our country  .  
 wonderful  !  we can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you  .  here it is  .  the unit price is usd 15 . 00 per kilogram  .  
 do you quote cif or fob  ?  
 it 's fob shanghai  .  
 could you quote the price of cif hamburg  ?  
 certainly  that 's easy  .  we will work out our cif offer this evening  .  could you come again tomorrow  say  at 10 am  ?  
well  we 've settled the problems of price  quality and quantity  .  what mode of payment do you wish to employ  ?  
 irrevocable letter of credit  of course  .  it 's the normal terms of payment in international business  .  
 could you adopt d  a or d  p  ?  you see i have to pay a deposit when i open a letter of credit  .  that will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports  especially for such a huge order  .  
 you might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum  .  
 anyhow  there would be certain bank charges  .  we 've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit  .  it would help me greatly  if you could accept d  a or d  p  .  it makes no difference to you  but it does to me  .  
can you exchange this for us dollars  please  ?  
 just fill out this form  will you  ?  
 ok  .  here  .  
 how would you like it  ?  
 five tens  five fives and the rest in ones  please  .  
i 'd like to open a savings account  .  can you tell me how to do it  ?  
 ok  .  you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents  .  
 i have a driver 's licence  a membership card and my passport  .  will they do  ?  
 let me see them  .  yes  they 're ok  .  
 what 's the minimum amount i can deposit in an account  ?  
 you can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars  .  
i 'd like to apply for a personal loan  .  
 how much would you like to borrow  ?  
 a thousand dollars  .  
 let me check with our credit manager  .   later  our record shows that your credit rating is quite high  .  i do n't think you 'll have any problems  .  
 what 's the current interest rate  ?  
i 'd like to open a current account  .  
 certainly  .  may i see your social security and your id  please  .  
 here you are  .  i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account  .  
 oh  current accounts do n't pay out interest  .  
 why is that  ?  
 it 's primarily designed for business transactions  .  that is  writing checks to pay for bills  buying things and sending money  .  we wo n't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account  .  
can you change american dollars into french francs  ?  
 yes  .  how much do you want  ?  
 fifty dollars  .  what is the exchange rate today  ?  
 one dollar to five francs  .  is that all right  ?  
 yes  please  .  and you can cash my traveler 's check  ca n't you  ?  
 of course  we can  .  
 i want to be here tomorrow  .  what are your business hours  ?  
 10 o 'clock in the morning to 2 o 'clock in the afternoon  .  
 thank you  .

 ok  here you are  .  
 thank you  have a nice day  .  
hey honey  how was your day  ?  
 it was alright  .  i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he  s in a bit of a jam  .  
 why  ?  what happened  ?  
 well  his son had an accident and bill doesn  t have health insurance  .  this really got me thinking  and i wondered if we shouldn  t look into a couple of different hmo  s  .  
 yeah  you  re right  .  we aren  t getting any younger and our kids are getting older  .  
 exactly  !  i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo  s with low copays and good coverage  .  the deductibles are low  too  .  
 sounds good  although  do you think we can qualify for insurance  ?  those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money  .  
 well  we don  t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions  so we should be fine  .  
 i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare  .  
hey  john  !  i haven  t seen you in ages  !  what  s new  ?  what have you been up to  ?  
 pete  !  nice to see you well  on top the norm  you know  wife and kids and work  i  ve actually gotten into doing some trading  .  
 trading  ?  you  big guy  ?  what are you trading  ?  
 currencies  .  
 currencies  ?  as in euros  dollars  pounds and rupees  ?  
 it  s called forex  .  foreign exchange  .  the great thing about it is that i don  t have to invest a huge amount  .  i put in a margin deposit and then i can buy and sell up to 100 times that much  !  
 i don  t understand  .  you  re buying and selling money  ?  
 you got it  !  just last night i made usd 150  !  
 last night  ?  
 yeah  !  it  s a 24 hour market  !  i had bought some rib earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so i made a split second decision and sold all my rib at an amazing bid  !  i  
sorry to bother you sir  but i have some bad news  .  
 what is it  ?  
 well  the stock market just took a huge plunge and we  ve lost a lot of money  !  
 what do you mean  ?  what happened  ?  
 there are many factors that weigh in  but nasdaq is down 200 points  the dow jones indicator also suffered  !  our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago  .  
 how is this possible  ?  you are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return  !  
 i know sir  !  we didn  t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden  .  on the other hand  you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets  .  we could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box  .  
are you ready to go to the bank  ?  
 sure  what do you need to do there  ?  
 there  s problem with my bank statement  .  there  s a mistake on it  .  i also need to withdraw some money form the atm  .  
 i have to exchange some money  .  
 that  s right  .  you  re going away next week  .  
 i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account  .  there was a problem last week  .  
 i have to pay my credit bill too  .  if i don  t pay it soon  the credit card company will charge me interest  .  
well  that was an interesting documentary  !  
 for sure  !  i didn  t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us  .  
 like what  ?  
 well  they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k  ?  
 yeah  i know it sounds weird  but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement  .  through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan  .  everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire  you can rest peacefully on your nest egg  .  
 that  s interesting and logical i guess  .  in my country  we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund  but most people don  t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that  .  
 that seems a bit unstable don  t you think  ?  
 yeah  but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions  so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank  .  
good morning  welcome to bank of the usa  .  how may i help you today  ?  
 hi  i need to transfer some money to another account  .  it  s urgent  .  
 okay  have you made a wire transfer at our bank before  ?  
 no  .  i  ve never made a transfer before  .  
 it  s alright  i will take you through the procedure  .  are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account  ?  
 a company account  .  i need to pay a bill  .  
 okay  i  ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank  s address and phone number  .  
 i have all the information in this folder  .  
 well  .  you  ve come prepared . you have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now  .  it  s a simple transaction  and we can process it today  .  
 oh  that  s such a relief  .  i didn  t want the payment to be overdue  .  thank you so much  .  
hello  sir  may i help you  ?  
 yes  .  i would like some information for requesting a loan  .  
 very well  here are the general terms of our loan policies  .  we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans  .  
 i see  .  so let me get this straight  .  if i borrow let  s say  ten thousand dollars  how much will i have to pay each month  ?  
 it depends on how long you take to pay it back  .  if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months  you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate  .  this of course is considering that you don  t default on a payment  !  
 it sounds good but  there is just one problem  .  i have a terrible credit score  .  
 that is a very serious problem you see  the bank must assess your personal information  past loans  assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan  .  
stupid girl  making me spend so much money  now i have to get it from the atm  .  .  .  
 hello  welcome to universal bank  .  please insert your card into the slot  .  
 i know where to put my card  !  stupid machine  talking to me like i  m an idiot  .  .  .  
 please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key  .  thank you  .  please select an option . thank you  .  you have selected withdrawal  .  
 yeah  yeah  i know what i selected  .  just give me my money  !  
 please type the amount you would like to withdraw . thank you  you want to transfer 10000 usd to the world wildlife foundation  .  if this is correct please press 1  .  
 no  no  !  stupid machine  what are you doing  !  no  !  
i love your little lulu dolls . how much for a batch of 6000  ?  
 for a batch of 6000 we would charge two dollars a doll  .  your total cost would be  12000  .  
 that  s a little steep for our company . do you offer any discounts  ?  
 well  we  d like to work with you  .  if you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little  .  can you increase your order to 15000  ?  
 hmmm . it wouldn  t be easy  but if the discount makes it worthwhile  we can consider it . how much of a discount would that give us  ?  
 for order of 12000 or more we charge only  1 . 5 a doll  .  your total cost would be  18000  .  
 so  for an additional 6000 dollars  we get twice as many dolls  ?  that still might be a little hard . couldn  t you discount it further  ?  we  ve been pricing other suppliers  and this discount might 
 we do value your business  .  i think i can offer a further discount  say 5   ?
