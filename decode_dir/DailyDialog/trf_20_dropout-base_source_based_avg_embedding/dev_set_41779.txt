well i swim and run every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it 's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .

but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .

sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .

many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .

yes i do . it 's a tradition . but i have to get higher grade in college .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no it s broken . i m going to have to warm it .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .

no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .

i came to check in please .
i 'm sure we have .
i am in the middle seat .
what education background do you have ?
yes sir what can i do for you ?

how long will it take me to get there ?
it s only about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . it 's my pleasure .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean by that ?
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what shall i do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
it will be fun . so i 'll have to work in a night waiting for you .

i 'm very sorry to hear that .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .

yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
i like that place but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm glad to hear that . i think it 's possible to move on to another company .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our apartments are <unk> .
sounds like a good idea . i will have to check in .
of course . it 's just a pleasure .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . do you know what the price of the house is ?
i m happy to go .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't get visitors to live in .

mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
i am sorry i can t make a decision until i am out .
no i 'll call back later .
see you then .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
that s great to hear .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . finally it 's located in the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 pounds a week .
it 's not expensive .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
i am afraid that this is what i am worried about . i just ca n't decide whether the amount is or not .
i do n't think i can save you enough .
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
do you think that i could do a lot of good ?
i will think of it . thanks for your advice .
where did you go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
yeah . . . i think he will be very easy to stop him .
but i still have no idea he will be . so i should go to his class to practice . he will definitely not give you a call .
let me see . in the afternoon i have a rest and probably on time .
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
well i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
hi cindy ! you are so cute !
wow ! what happened ?
it was n't too crowded .
oh thank you . i m a little nervous .
not a lot actually . i 've been pretty busy .

i am completely serious .
since last night .
i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a team player .
if so counter i think joe is more interested .
yeah it 's pretty much what you 're thinking .
that means he is n't too rushed for one person . and i think he might be interested in an italian way .
ok .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any plans . how about tomorrow evening ?
i see . are there any other seats available ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do . we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
i m looking for a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want a little bit overweight . you also want a little extra room for the shower to get a little extra room in the waist area .
wow ! i thought you were right ! my parents are taking me to a christmas tree and they said i should get married to the holiday !
it s easy . pick up your car in a better position .
now what are you talking about ? i can t stand the music !
oh you ve got a lot of homework ! i can t wait to watch the dragon boat race !
what do i do next ?
can you bring me something ? i m sure you can play it as well .
well they are all grown up now . let 's just get a load of it .

i m sorry . . um why don t we take a look at the campbell ?
i 'm looking for a sharp dvd player .

what can i see ? come on mary please . i ll show you how to call her .
are you aware that you never used to get a camera ?
so you have to courses for the semester ?
i am sorry sir . it 's not allowed .
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
that s true . when you paid more attention to the size of the city and where you prefer . this article means that you must buy it .
well it is a little tight the heat is very thick and the air is fresher than those in the city .
i d like to have a look at a digital camera .
hey ! that 's the one . . this one . . . yes . . .
i think that s a great idea . i d like to have a try .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
yes i do . how much is it ?
it 's okay .
i m sorry sir . you can t take too long . are you with me ?
i know . i ll get it .
no problem .
i have a problem with this check .
the ground beef is 2 . 48 .
could you also get a dozen eggs and a beer ?

yes ! it s very fine ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
ok . i ll pick you up at 600 .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that s fine . let s move on to the end of the week .
i want to buy a ticket to sydney .
do you want some flowers ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
what s that ?
what is the special effects of these other people ?
well this is a gift that i like . she s a young man and smart color .
i think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger than a dozen .
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but i still look it when i was in a shop that was open .
what is your biggest weakness ?
yes we can do that . but you want me to send you a copy machine .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if i can play a little or get a computer that will help .
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it doesn t work it does we ll have to sell it soon .
i know i know . i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
what finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
so complicated ! ok i ll start by it all right ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool ! i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i know . it 's much cheaper than paying a bus or a bus route to be a bus route to downtown .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my mum does n't want a pet that 's only a few minutes .
i think we should go out more frequently . the weather is just a little bit out of the weather .
maybe we 'll go to the latin club . i do n't want some beer .
that sounds great . i 'll read the fine print .
thank you very much . that 's very nice of you .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
i 'm afraid not .
i 'm here to see about a fixed asset loan .
certainly sir . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a wireless <unk> and a wireless <unk> .
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
you ve got to attach the receipts with the normal range . and we can provide you with a small monthly fee .
awesome !
i was told to put a sales manager .
i will be there in a sec .
besides your major do you have any other fields ?
i know what you mean . i just ca n't stand the loud and it 's only fair .
can you show me how to turn them on ?
yes it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
i like the design of summer too . it s too cold for you and the things like that .
i am sorry . i ca n't give you the price .
can you tell me about the features of your mind ?
how about this one ? it 's the latest design simple but it 's digital .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
i m sorry ms . fairbanks . i won t let it happen again .
it 's really a big change . the rent is fantastic .
well it 's cheap . but it 's quite convenient .
but i do n't think so . it could be a little trouble .
but i like the winter . i prefer summer .
true . and what about this one ? this one is the latest fashion .
it s nice but it has a balcony .
oh no . the view is spectacular . but you can also notice the balcony .
maybe we could get some new furniture .
i have a few shirts . i can get rid of that .
i love it . the rooms are great .
it s my wife .
the rent is 400 yuan per month .
that s too expensive .
what is the most important thing for you ?
i can t stand the noise in the city .
that s not a problem . by the way would you please reserve a seat for me ?
what s the problem ?
would you mind telling me the responsibilities of the activities you ask for ?
i want to know what the date that you want to do .
i am afraid not . that s the best i can do .
yes i do . i like doing it very much . the food here is tasty and it is a spicy restaurant .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything is clean .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
actually i do like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti with me ? i do n't like italian food .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients . the food is prepared to be the best food .
yeah . i will try my best .
it depends on the topic . some of the day i am learning about how to use these things .
let me see . it s fine .
can i have a black pair of black leather shoes ?
an ordinary one ? ! i know you have a choice of suit that you have in mind . i can also try the best of lipstick . i will take care of it .
i don t want the price we are sure to get what you want .
what s the matter with your bedroom ?
what is the qualification needed ?
yes . i like the design of this house . my friend is sick . it s cheap .
i like one black one .
what size do you want ?
any style will be fine .
great . i will take it .
ok .
i 'm sorry . you have the wrong number .
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about the interview ?
oh you can still live on campus .
i am interested in a onebedroom apartment .
i 'm glad to hear that . how much will it be ?
good . i 'll come back tomorrow and we can then discuss it more specifically .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you think it 's a good idea to get in the office ?
no i have n't got one . thanks .
i see .
that 's fine .
no . that s all . do n't worry . we 'll check it out .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i 'm glad you thought of it . hey i think i 'd like to buy a new suit .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
that 's exactly what i 'm looking for .
i can t wait to play in the mood for the rest of the week . let s go !
i think you re right . i m going to have to look at the safety manual of our company .
let 's have it please .
well that 's a long one . i think i 'll take it .
i think it s wonderful . i ve got the kitchen and the walls just returned up from the office .
a larger problem with the view from this city looks like a nice view .
i see .
i 'm getting a little short on my own . now that i 'm going to take a dog .
well you can still go to a etv . it is perfect to be here in summer .
oh look at the view from the window .
i can t stand the noise in the city .
i see . i have a look at the colors and i can look at the in the dark .
my god ! it 's a classic and two desks .
i like the jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .
let 's go look at that . the interior is very complicated .
i will be bringing a right away with your name and address .
it s blond .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hi i am calling from future . i am calling to confirm the date of the next interview . is that available ?
where are you living now ?
i would love to see it for a while .
let s go to a etv tonight .
yes i am . i 'm meeting at <unk> p . m .
we have express service as well . it 's a good idea to start it .
that 's great . i 'll see you then .
do you need to know what you mean by a living style ?
thank you .
we might need to check your driver 's license .
yes . i 'm looking for a green dress .
well you know you have several new customers . i can tell you about our new computer program .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it 's a most popular dish .
history .
that 's great . we can talk about your educational background and your spending experience and your spending habits for a week .
sounds reasonable .
yes .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
yes . i 'm an engineer .
do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . it 's apple .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think i need any other for a student .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what are you trying to get ?
i 'm trying to send you a kiss . .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
so what are the most fundamental course ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
why are you thinking about a dvd player ?
i know . i need a computer that would help me with my current account .
i think it 's important to be happy .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . please press the button when you need any help .

i got laid off today .
i don t think that s what i m going to do .
what s the problem ?
what will you do when you be home ?
i am giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . take an aspirin when you 've got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home and rest in bed for two days . drink plenty of water then you 'll feel better .
yes i will .
i m sorry .
if that s the case then i will fix the faucet .
i will .
i think that i have . i really like it but i don t think i ve seen anything like that .

i wrote the check out for way too much .
i don t think that the glass is too big .

yes . i called the first three people on the list but they said they didn t pick up a new apartment .

i think that we should check out the kitchen . it 's very important to go .
i guess i should go and have a look at it . do you have any other option ?
could you tell me where the problems are ?
what is your address ?
i will do it for you .
i can t believe that the lease will be up and i ll be right back .
yes but i 'm very careful with it .
well do you know for sure ?
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes .
well you 'd better go to the police station first .
no we have n't . we have to get there in a few minutes .
did you see the movie ?
well do n't you know for sure ?
do you know which direction it is ?
there is a mean sign ?
sure . it is very quiet and peaceful .
the last bus i went to washington . the bus does n't count on me .
let 's see which bus should we take ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
i like lotus .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
i have n't taken the bus before but i decided to take the bus something wrong with my friend .
may i ask whether we need to work overtime ?
no i do n't . i go on a bus with my family .
what does your work consist of exactly ?
no but i could take it .
do you want one ?
i do n't know . i like it but i do n't know how to goes .
that will be very expensive .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
how about the subway ?
oh no . the bus goes down and fast .
why ? you make me confused .
i do n't think this bus was too crowded .
what 's your number ?
i got it from macy 's .
i am really sorry .
i m serious .
yes but it was really interesting .
but i do n't know what to get .
hi ann . i have n't seen you for ages .
i 'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
that 's wonderful . i bet he 's really cute .
i 'm still not sure what 's the name of the store ?
that 's what i was thinking .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
you like the food there ?
i don t know but i think i know there are many good ones .
well i 'm sorry sir but i think our price is a little too high .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in the comes .
are you sure you have the right counter ?
well i guess i should .
i 'm sorry i 've been busy . why do n't you go for a walk ?
i hope that i have a good journey .

it must have been painful .
that 's strange . but what did you do ?
all right i will explain it to you later . now scram .
but i still love the rhythms .

my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what kind of soup would you like ?
can you tell me about the safety ?
you re welcome .
oh nothing special . i just had a bad day and i 'm having a bad cold .
what s your name ?
i got a job offer from dell .
but i have no idea how it s going to be a great time .
i was talking to you about that . it s an accident .
but i think it s better to do this .
i thought i 'd stop stop smoking .
why ? what does he say ?
i have been studying english for 6 months .
i understand . i thought you had been having an easy time .
i 've thought about it but i 'm really tired .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
next month .
oh it 's really a lot of fun .
what kind of music do you like ?
thank you . i have n't had a chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i ride on the subway as it is .
i think that we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
maybe . i agree with you . but my husband is trying to find a job eventually .
well i know that it 's my treat .
i suppose . and some other cars are very expensive too .
no but i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
i would be glad to help you . it would be very hard to try one of my job .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
i 'm sure you 'll love your new car . if you follow me you 'll be able to get a new one .
what can i do for you ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i m so excited .
what kind of room do you like ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
i know . but it 's good to have a fruit in my country .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i know . i like it a way to try it .
what if i had a chance to see the results ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . what about you ? have n't seen you for a long time .
i 'm a doctor .
i love to places that have and go to .
that 's great . what kind of job are you looking for ?
i see . well it 's not my fault .
see you .
i 'm sorry mum . i 'll go with you in a moment .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
thanks for your compliment . i 'm very fast learner and i have n't got a chance to practice with my english .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
you 're right . i love going to take a course with you .
very well . what other foreign languages do you like to speak to ?
i 'm dead serious . you know we were talking about our son's attendance for classes and i 'm still a little bit confused .
no problem . good luck to you .
i 've already got a pair of trousers .
well you can just take the subway to the university .
oh i see . when do i get to the bank ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
oh i see . thanks .
i can help you with both .
i love that suggestion but i really want to paint the walls right now . i think i could get a new apartment soon .
we have various types of food and wine . besides i am not sure which one do you prefer ?
so if i do decide to put my resume in a paper i can use the same paper .
i really want to go to see the real estate office .
so do you think many kids are just going to get married to a human resources store ?
you are right . that s good to hear .
i want to study abroad . i 'm going to the states .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
well i am certainly going to take some university courses there .
how do you get along with others ?
yes it is .
i think the most important thing is that you want to do is fill in the blanks with the copy of the contract . do you want to use the copy machine here ?
that 's very nice of you . and where are you going now ?
she 's very nice .
i know . he had no idea a word to say that .
yes he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .

it must be interesting to study english .

i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
oh yeah i m a pretty big fan of using new technology but i don t know what to do .
why is that ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

i need some to keep as souvenirs !

i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
wow ! you really went a lot of hard work !
i see . and your company has some good reputation in the past .
the machines are too slow for me . i suggest you use the same page . the same way as if you do n't mind .
i still think that that is what the parents think .
i know but after a while i 'm out of work i 'm sure i 'll wear a good job and make a face .
they must be helpful . the general public is resources for their sake . can i have the whole day at 11

i d like to do that .
i appreciate your help .
oh that s great . thank you very much .
now you should check out the connections .
here you are .
what ?
i think this is really a place to go .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i really do n't think i can handle it .
that s all right . but i m sorry .
because i have found it .

i did n't want to .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry but i have to go to the police station .
but you should have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
well i do n't think you 'd be interested in it .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
that sounds great . let me give you a call .
hey honey you 're not going to be able to eat my weight .

do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what shall i do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

do you think i believe the story like that ?
sure . what do you want to know ?
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
but we should n't have any trouble if the restaurant is coming .
i wrote the check out for way too much .
then when did you have a look at your report ?
i bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago .
how about this steak ? i do n't like it .
i 'm sorry but it 's not the right material . would you mind giving me the wrong description ?
well i do n't think this color is too big for me . do you like it ?
oh i just forgot that it is not what i ordered .
you 're welcome . now smile . . .
sure . i 'd love another glass .
how much do i owe you ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
no problem . i 'll see you on thursday then .
we have all kinds of coffee in sizes . let 's just sit down here .
i know . i bought it in spring street several months ago . it s very nice to buy a new one .
yeah here you go .
thank you . please fill out this paperwork .
not at all . the fitting room is over there .
no you can only exchange this amount .
i 'm afraid that 's the most important thing i 've ever had .
i have some bad news for you .
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
show me some traditional arts and crafts .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
well the term discomgoogolation comes from discombobulate and google . because floods of information are just a mouse click away net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .
oh dear !
i can understand .
i know that he would never do anything .
that s true . i ll see you tomorrow at 2 o clock .
oh how much do you charge ?
does it close at that time ?
i ca n't wait to see it . i 'm pretty excited .
what ? why ? will you renew the cost of living ?
well i m just wondering if you like to go to the party and drop by yourself . i ll make the reception .
i am sure you know that the price of the market is high quality .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
mmm i can t see that .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well i know this may seem like a silly question but does your car have gasoline ?
sounds good . where do i go ?
it is best if we take a look at the sign . please take a seat and sign here .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ?
oh nothing . i just had a bad day .
i was late to work today . i forgot to call you back in about 30 minutes .
really ? that s great . what s the problem ?
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want to know how to spoil our happiness .
can you put your hand where it is ?
yeah .
yes i do . that s why i did n't want to order the same thing .
well i think it s going to be a very good thing for you to live in the country .
do n't worry . you will love them .
thank you .
oh i get it . you re such a nice girl !
thanks a lot .
oh no . i 'm afraid we do n't have any for that .
i am sorry . but that 's why i have n't done it .
i 'm sorry but it 's far quicker and less than ten minutes . why do n't you go to bed and get up at six thirty ?
so what are you gonna do ?
i am going to go to the gym and to be a lot of fun .
do you have any other plans this weekend ?
oh no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be serious ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has to be met !
well that seems easy enough .
yeah and they are very easy to learn .
geez ! what is the minimum annual interest rate ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well i um . . . i just like a trim . nothing too fancy .
how about the sideburns ? you just have to use your hair .
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t be silly . i ll take care of everything .
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's quite nice . will it be light ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m sorry but i think you should have got a virus .
i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well shall i see the doctor ? i know you ve been making a lot of noise first .
sounds like a very good idea ! i have n't seen you for quite a long time . what is your favourite award ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
you mean the middle of the game ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
well you d better sit down . how are you ?
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
i m sorry ms . fairbanks . i ve got it finished .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
what 's your aim in doing ?
i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! they are everywhere ! little jerks .
why not ?
no i forgot to buy some .
if you buy it the machine you will have to charge for your use .
it s a a good thing that i ve got .
i guess you re right . maybe that s what i should do .
i know ! i think you deserve a chance to try and give me another chance .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i m sorry but you 'll be able to find your way around this time .
i am not . i just had to be alone .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think i wear a pair of glasses also get a pair of earrings .
anyway i think that i m not going to look at my eyes .
i think you look pretty good at the heels . i think you look pretty in a little ways .
come on you sound like my mom . i know i should clean your face .
what would you like to see ?
but what ! i just told you that i m just gonna get him to talk about the heat .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? i think i ll take it .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought you were pleased with it .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
if you leave your mind let s go to a formal party next time .
well he s more nice than like him .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
i just watched the movie and i 'm very sorry . i 'm single .
alright come here ! i m gonna get a little while .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you think we 'll have a lot of time to get a lot of fun in mind .
well they are very different you know . but they are very different from what you do .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
yes i 'm not feeling well . i just hope the weather will be good .
i need some to keep as souvenirs !
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
you 're right . i should learn how to use it . it 's hard to keep a clean place in china .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . for me . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think you will have a chance at getting your new job ?
i did n't know you wanted to come to .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
no . i did n't . but i saw her last week . she was a bit disappointed .
i see what you mean !
you really do ? i 'm glad you could do it .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow . what would you like to drink ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
you re leaving so soon . when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
we 'll take you to the conference center at four o 'clock in the afternoon .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy but i 'm having a holiday to relax .
so what have you been up to ?
do n't you think it 's a good idea to have a fever ?
i 'll see you there !
i got a job offer from dell .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm on my way out to a new year 's banquet . how do i look ? is my makeup ok ?
it 's not your fault . and i ca n't help bursting into tears at your new album .
you 're right !
well what if you think about it ?
it must have been love at first sight because i know he had a hard day and he did it .
you are absolutely right . but you 'd better give a shot .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .
what do you think of these fields ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
so you did n't have to write your name address ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's it ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i know . i like your mom . she does n't like milk in it .
yeah it s been ages .
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
yes i m worried about my mother .
what are you going to have ?
i 'm hungry .
ok let 's go .
how long did it take ?
it 's ok with me but i think we have a car coming .
oh i see .
i 'm just thinking of taking you .
do n't you think that dangerous people would be healthy ?
i don t like your mother .
how about a dinner tonight ?
i 'm sorry . i have to go .
i 'm sorry .
ok . i 'll pick you up at five thirty .
i see .
i am glad you are so lucky .
i 'm so glad to hear that .
what a surprise ! i have a great time .
are you busy ? you seem a bit worried about me .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
well that 's fine . we can talk about it now .
i know it is quite different from the chinese embassy . it was a minor problem .
i 'll be there .
how was your game today ?
chill ! i 'm just curling my eyelashes .
i 'm sorry i 've been having a cold .
do n't worry . i 'll make sure everything will be fine .

you re welcome .
oh good . where are the keys ?
yes .
ok . let 's go .
it is very quiet and peaceful . this is what i have in my car .
i was also interrupted by her last week .
i think it 's worth it .
these look wonderful . they 're singing in a rut . i 'll show you around .
yes my father and i were planning to get married in europe .
that 's okay .
i m at the polling place .
i see .
ms . stevens is in . i 'll show you something to get on for you .
he 's got a promotion .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
no joke !
i used to be a parttime student . but i heard that these sorts of classes were very rare .
i think you might like to be a dvd player .
oh no . the ones who do n't sell like the red ones .
i guess you 're right . most of the time it is so important to stop .
well do n't think much of it . there is also a dining room and a standard bath .
you can do that . both teams just have a common personality .
uh . . . i 'm just a little short . . .
no i have n't . i 've heard about it but i 've got to go .
i like lotus .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
i think you ll like the problem . there s too much pressure to stop smoking .
yeah . i know . i just like playing basketball .
what is it ?
thanks . i 'll have a cup of tea first .
true and this one is the latest design .
it 's the circus .
i know . but we 'd be making a decision on the new project .
i ca n't . he is so cute .

oh i will . where can i get them ?
oh look at the sign please !
it 's a little ancient but i 've seen it before .
oh that s a sad name .
really ? it was a kind of you .
sure . let 's go .
really ? i guess i have n't had a chance to travel abroad . i really do n't have a lot of money to travel and are still a lot of fun .
that s true .
yes it was quite a few experience when i was in high school . that 's why we decided to leave the country .
yeah you 're right . but i think you 'd better learn from her .
yeah . i just got back from the theatre . i started learning english when i was at college . so i often get a lot of chance to practice by myself .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
he 's a sad dog . he came to the wedding in jeans !
i ca n't see that . i have n't seen the memo . it 's an excellent program .
let me see . we have a copy of your contract .
the author was a great love and the discus record was made by 200 dollars . that was the best actor !
i 'm finished .
well . what a pity . i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket .
you have no choice so you 'd better prepare for the resume .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about he ?
do you think he 'll become interested in it ?
so he sometimes do the same .
i just want to know about this ?
merry christmas to you !
the same to you !
we sing happy birthday at the party and have birthday cakes .

i think so . she is very pretty .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
haven t you heard about it ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
i think it 's going to rain .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
what 's your number ?
i do n't know but i 've seen it before !
so that i do n't have a large collection .
what are you doing on the computer ?
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . there you are . it 's the pleasure to have dinner with us .
short messages i like to read books about my books . i like to read books on books . in fact i do n't get a list of things but i do n't have any depth for me .
i m afraid you re a fireman and it s not very dangerous . i love the countryside . it s a dangerous job .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i love the best . my favorite subject is in a world .
so you do n't have any hobbies .
i 'm the general manager of the fareast industry corporation .
so what are you talking about ?
i feel sick of doing the give me any more information about the day before you get back .

really ? i want to go too .
six .
oh let s see . . . the ref has closed !
i think harry will get it .
so the host announced that it is ?
really ? i m very excited about that .
yes it is . it 's a common practice .
i am so jealous of you . it 's hard to say .
sure . you can take a seat in the smoking section or the outer packing .
no . he likes to leave his wife 's brother .
that 's right . i think they 'd better take the security .
i know it s a exciting game but i love you so much .
i guess so . he is also an excellent speaker .
i used to be really busy but now i have no time to learn . i have to get into some day to move . so i am still learning to .
yeah i agree . and i also love this beautiful digital !
yeah fortunately life is just not the opposite .
is it true that there is a sales reduction in in price ?
i do n't think so . it 's probably about time i think .
i see . do you have a cat ?
you know she 's the one who tried to be a <unk> .
but my little brother has been very good .
hard to say now but i think the score is a little too small .
yes . we all hope that the team will win .
it seems that the work experience will not not win .
ok .
hi . steven !
hi angela it 's dan .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what 's it ?
ping . ping . ping .
what 's your name ?

no it 's the japanese team .
do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .

what should i do ?
okay . i 'll tell him .
really ? what happened ?
see you tomorrow night .
the rockets .
how about some fish ?
seventy to sixtyseven .
that 's the one . the main reason is that the name of the united states is <unk> .
do n't worry about it . try to be punctual next time . that 'll make a little more convenient .
i know i know . but i think it 's the worst time i 've been talking about .
so you 're probably right about that . what is your new address ?
yeah . he s never got a job .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .

good luck .
i will thank you .
i plan to go back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?

i did . it was a a heavy storm with lots of .
i understand . why did you change your job ?

i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a team player .
if so counter i think joe is more interested .
yeah it 's pretty much what you 're thinking .
that means he is n't too rushed for one person . and i think he might be interested in an italian way .
ok .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any plans . how about tomorrow evening ?
i see . are there any other seats available ?
i do n't know .
i do n't know . i do n't know how to handle it .
what kind of music do you like ?
short and sweet . i like them best .
yeah i like the way you can find exactly what they like or dislike . if i m not happy with the chinese people i ve just italian i like the food .
it looks like you have to buy tickets for us jason .
no i do n't like it . he s a bit too old . i ve had a lot of nerve wracking things up in the old .
yes it is the best way to relax .
yes it is . i can also learn from the heat and make some feel awful .
oh we had a birthday party for david last night . as a matter of fact i am sure i can get used to it .
i think that the air brings a little too much .
a friend of mine from a friend of mine . he was a bit nervous . i just got a word that he wo n't be in charge of a <unk> . he 's a friend of a team .
yes . he 's a member of the basketball association .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
yeah . he came in from a traffic accident .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did n't they ever get hurt ?

i had to get the hotdog stand .
i 'm so sorry . i thought you two were very good at her .
i do n't remember but i am still single .
i had to get the confidence but i didn t really know it was that clear .
i think that he had a litter too much of the kitchen .
he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red hair .
it certainly sounds like you are my mom .
miss i hope you have a nice flight .
it 's very kind of you .
and where 'd you get a ticket ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
i love you happy anniversary . thank you .

no it is n't .
it 's ok so i do n't know how to make this necessary arrangements . it will be a new one and i will have to pay you for it .

i hope so . you know what ? i mean when you 're in college you always skipped classes .

and what is the occasion ?
i have an plans for everyone . so how do you know ?
what a wonderful meal !
they are attending a party here in sydney .
wow ! they are very compact and are designed for ever people who are allowed to go to church without keys .
yes that 's right . all of the people do is listen to the human nature of the nature .

i will do it .
well . . . how about we go for a picnic ?
i have just arrived from beijing . this is my first time to be here .

i need to buy a ticket .
the tv station will air the world cup football match alive at 8 30 .
anyway i 'm really confused . why do n't you give it a second ?
yeah and you never know what .
wow ! and what else do you want to play ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you can transfer money to another account or you can use your atm .
about two weeks ago .
the competition is very expensive .
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's my pleasure . hope you will have a nice trip home .
i 'll tell you what .
thank you .
that 's right . well it 's a little expensive .
200 yuan for each person .
can you give me a large room ?
oh no . it 's just what i want .
you can do that . we just have to sign a contract .
ok . i 'll wait for you .
so it will be ok ?
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
let me see it .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so what is the average size of these two ?
do n't you know that ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
what are we talking about ?
have you seen the sights yet ?
thanks a lot . i expect to see you again sometime .
that s what made it so great .
do you know how to play it ?
we have to return here .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i m afraid i m too busy to get out of the city . i really need to have a holiday to relax .
it 's a great pleasure . let 's go into the personnel market .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
i have been cooking more than a u . s . dollars to be sure .
sure . i think i 'll try the lobster .
but i do n't like eating . i ve had enough of house to eat .
i 'm glad you came . you 're welcome anytime .
just a beer please .
oh i see . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i have to make sure that this is the right bus does n't take too long .
i used to be a better singer but i know i got it .
oh no . i do n't think i 'd be a very good employee . what about the period ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? where did you go ?
no not really . i was busy getting out of the city . i 'm a bit tired .
really ? it 's great . you should go there too .
yeah i worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl .
do you think it will work ?
i 'm glad you came . you 're right .
you had a long flight you must be tired .
do n't worry . i 'll take care of it .
i think the spirit of the paper is a little too long . make sure you show them what you want to do .
no please feel free .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
oh right . i 'm in the mood for a while . let 's put the ball on your face .
please do n't be so glad to be so sure to get your passport .
disco is my favorite . i do n't like it . but i do n't like it .
you are quite wonderfully .
i like the fact that i have no taste . i ca n't wait to try it out .
do n't be silly . i just do n't like your way dance to a dance .
yes the music has stopped . and music is a good way to dance .
that sounds like a good idea . but i 'm afraid i ca n't stand her butting in when i was trying to emphasize punishment for a point .
well that 's why i like tennis and i think that the most amazing performances are by themselves .
i heard it 's the ancient olympics . the ancient chinese enterprises were supposed to be made in china .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body .
that s exactly what i was thinking . i mean i d like to do it .
they are in the cupboard where it is .
you 're designed to eye with me !
good idea . i 'm sure you will like it .
yeah . i love it .
i suggest we visit the <unk> museum of art first now . it 's a beautiful country .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid i ca n't place the same name .
do you have a better selection ?
how nice ! but i 'm not a good dancer and i do n't know how to play in the movies .
i 'm glad you appreciate our folk music . but a live performance will be much fun .
yes i 'd like to . i have n't had a part in a play in a single day .
you dance beautifully too .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
do you know how to dance ?
yes . how about rumba ?
let me give you a hand .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your seat . i 'd like to try them on .
i 'm afraid i do n't .
i 'm here on business .
i agree . i appreciate the news .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
maybe you 're right . but i think you 'll be a bit crazy about this one .
no . the music has stopped .
and to drink too much of water
yes a nice evening .
sounds like a great idea . i 'm really hungry .
do you have any hobbies ?
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
what do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 've tried hard to learn but i 'm not much of a dancer and i do n't dance in the mood for myself .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh you 're a good singer . but i do n't know how to dance is the first time you 're in a <unk> .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
i like variety shows .
well what do you think about the time of your life ?
no sir . the tour will take about 15 minutes .
sounds interesting . but i do n't think they 're easy to carry in a different way .
i 'll give you a call later .
what kind of visuals should i use to support the young ? what do you think ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i 'm glad you told me .
that s great . where is the men's room ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
how about the umbrella ?
i like spring .
i like it very much .
i am glad you are here . it is the nicest city in the united states .
i think the weather is wonderful .
yes especially in spring .
i like spring too . it is a lovely city .
i think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . would you like to help me with the sweater ?
it 's going to be there by 5 o 'clock .
that 's a great idea . how long will it take to get there ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i guess it 's the same in the uk .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
great idea ! i love it .
that 's true . i love flowers and hence have been set of this city .
what 's the damage to your room ?
yes the weather is so warm .
yes .
i 'm glad you 're here . it 's the most beautiful city in beijing .
oh i forgot about it .
it 's very kind of you .
you can also ask the policeman over there .
oh i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i appreciate the effort sir . and i 'm really happy with you .
what would you like to drink ?
sure let me give you a add of the word .
thank you . goodbye .
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
what a pity !
that 's good to hear . good luck !
yes . i have no plans .
it 's good to hear that . we have to go now .
i 'd love to .
where did you get to the ticket from ?
oh are you ?
about 2 o clock .
oh i m sorry . we re going to have to get there early .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
it is a great deal .
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
i guess so . some people just have to try to take public transportation .
i ca n't log on the internet again .
let 's take a look at it . do you want to have a look at it ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
how do you think it is ?
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
i think there is some loose bolts on one of the wings . it happens all the time . no need to worry .
i know that but it 's ok .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
why ? they are very good .
i ca n't afford it .
i know ! i never had a hard time to say !
i had to look after my son at home .
did he give you any advice ?
he has a bad cold .
oh i see . what a pity . i have to tell him i called several times .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you re welcome . i hope you 'll have a good time here .
you re welcome . we have more reasonable prices for rich people .
it is so but i doubt if it will be .
oh thank you ! i got him for a nice job and he is very nice .
really ? does he have a good chance to play with you ?
yes he does . he s really good at this sort of thing .
would you like to sit in a smoking section or a nonsmoking room ?
i 'm a little short on cash . i have to take my visa card .
i think you 're right . it 's just a time .
then i 'll try to get her on her again .
i 'd love to . but i 'm sorry i have to help my mother .
that 's great . if you have any questions about it let 's go .
i am sorry i have to ask you .
i 'm afraid this hotel is full .
i am so glad i could n't make it .
they re a big fan of tv .
that 's a big family .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
you too .
it 's no problem at all . hope you can get a hold of him .
it looks like you 're very fond of the film .
you 're welcome . i hope you will have a good trip .
i hear we 'll have a new english teacher this semester .
i 'm just glad you came .
twice a year .
i know what you mean . i just want to give her a try .
don t be sad .
that 's incredible .
you mean you can make it ?
i 'd love to . but i ca n't stand the house for being famous i 've never seen a place before .
ok let 's talk about it next time .
i know life is always my favorite . i have a lot of fun . i will try .
the problem is to take off the card of your sleep .
i think it 's very easy . i have the confidence in our company .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm afraid i have n't had time since i got married .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i watched the movie forrest gump last night .
you should have kept an eye on it .
i just want to know what the company is .
sure . what 's the problem ?
could you tell me about the cabins ?
which one is this ?
i know but i bought it in the original market . i was in the subject . i told her i 'd be a bit more attractive .
well it 's a little bit expensive but they 're quite old and it 's quite comfortable .
very good . so it seems you had a great time .
yes . and no . . . . i 'm sorry . the tour will have to be closed . so i want to change all the time .
why not ?
and it 's a dark cloud over there .
well i think you 're ready to graduate this year with a company and have to prepare for the visa .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
now we should look at the samples and see if they can deliver them .
i could give you a discount if you give me a discount .
no thank you . i just want to tell you that i m in a meeting with my wife .
yeah you 're right .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in yet .
i do n't want to .
you have to give up smoking . it 's bad for your health .
no . it 's not .
not exactly . i was born in <unk> .
they had a fight with the fact .
i know exactly what i mean .
yes they were . i was n't there when i was a child . that was the first two of the robbery .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear to go to the bathroom !
my parents called me this morning . they were my sister and my sister .
thank you mr . johnson . mr . johnson for a moment please .
oh you like it .
no problem . i 've already got your time . and we need to borrow the chairs from the lunchroom .
yeah you can make a good selection of sugar .
the last beginning of the month .
oh i did n't know you had a parttime job . so i started learning english when i was at college .
i have some bad news for you .
thanks a lot .
i want to wash my hair .
ok . i will .
she 's still in the states .
when did you last see her ?
i 've been here for years .
i guess so . it 's a beautiful wedding .
she lives in an old house in sydney .
not really . i went to bed early and the night before dinner .
why did you go to the gym ?
yes i have one .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
three .
do you often go back to bed ?
they are blue and blue .
hello ms jones . this is a jones .
eight . they are older and the ones are nearly 90 .
hello ms . jones . i have an appointment with ann .
yes they are .
hello ms . li . this is a wonderful engagement ring .
it 's a scholarship .
really ? that sounds interesting .
no she s right .
is it very strict ?
what 's your favorite flower ?
oh it s really very good .
i love you .
thanks a million .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin . he likes smiling .
so you 're hearing from him ?
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
that 's a long time .
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes people surely can . he 's whiter than the chinese kids and his hair is a little blonde . my husband says his eyes are very chinese though .
sure what is it ?
how long will it take ?
do you know how to use them ?
it will be fun . it will be a good night .
why ? you are so excellent . if i were you i would tell her the white lie about her in the office ?
i hope so .
how about a training course ? that 's why it s true .
don t worry . they re fine .
oh yes .
ok . i ll put the call .
yes .
why did you stay a little longer ?
i have n't taken a bus before .
oh i do n't know . but my wife found out he is a dangerous man .
where are you going to work ?
yes please .
you don t love me ?
no . i will .
i can tell you from a couple of different countries .
but it 's really a good idea to give up my mind . i 'll take him an xray to the doctor .
yeah he did n't come home until 1200 am .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 hours .
i 'll be right back .
but i do n't think she 's actually very serious .
yes .
i 'd love to . but i have to work late . i 'm really tired .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i think it 's already a good way to make the presentation .
are you a qualified teacher ?
well a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steelstring guitar s . it s best suited for finger picking . a steelstring is best for playing chords .
what time does it start ?
what is your favorite title ?
well he 's got a lot of homework .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell you from experience that he might make a perfect fit .
i 've got to go .
i 'll make sure and come back in a wonderful evening .
i do n't think it 's as good as it does .
it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky . i love you so much .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
that 's great . it 's a good idea to have a walk .
i have a guest pass . why do n't you come with me tonight ?
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
that 's great ! let 's discuss it over !
yes i do . but the reds are always a bit weak in the scene .
did you have a fight with your boss ?
well i was just thinking of taking a vacation to me .
i do n't know . we have n't had any trouble with going out .
i will do that right now .
yes it 's a <unk> .
i do n't think that it 's a great idea .
you have no idea about that .
would people like a drink ?
yes the only reason i 've been here .
do you know any places where you may like to work for ?
i 'm fine thanks . how about you mary ? how are you doing today ?
oh i d love to . but i m afraid i can t . i ve already got a lunch engagement .
yeah i 'll be there .
the bride is in the garden jane . it is a lovely day .
sure . our local theater is just across the street just west .
sure i will . can you tell me how to do your christmas ?
i 'll do that .
i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
thank you .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have a severe headache now .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
how about the umbrella ? it 's nice in the middle of the summer .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
hi linda i was wondering if you could come to a party with us .

i have lived here for twenty years .
do you have any other requirements ?
what color did you like best ?
how many would you like ?
what do you think i should do ?
all right . we 'll have a glass of lemonade .
i 've been away on a vacation .
i have been pretty busy these days .
just since yesterday .
really ? how do you know that ?
i have been a production manager for two years .
why did you go to university ?
i major in japanese .
but sir the employee must be aware that each passenger has been mailed in a company .
i know . i 'm going to try my best to find a job .
yes i 've been out of town .
thanks a lot . you are so kind .
i appreciate all help of you during the interview .
yes i graduated from the beijing college of foreign trade . my major is english .
i 'm glad you 're happy .
i 'm pretty good . i 've just bought a house and i want to take a trip to the conference . it 's really busy !
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thanks a lot .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
well they play the piano a lot .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it 's beautiful but i think it 's also sunny .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we go see it ?
well that sounds like a good idea . today we have a great time to work .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
this is the beautiful city . look at this little while the mafia gets here . the village looks so peaceful .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get cold again .
may i have your name ?
i know . i don t mean to be mean if you think of all the things you are sad or excited .
whatever . just make sure you leave it .
she 's looks like a typical girl .
you must have got married .
tom that lucky guy .
oh he s fine . he s been here for quite a few days .
that 's terrible . he must have been pretty easy to do .
fine thanks . and you ?
i know . it s going to be a great night .
he came in too hard to say .
does he have a moustache or a beard ?
you want to get married with your girlfriend ?
yes but i did n't know that .
yes it 's not like him . let 's ask him to give us a ring .
then why didn t you tell me ?
you can say that again .
it sounds like she is pretty .
yes she s right . but i think that she should be pleased .
i know but i am thinking of her .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but i 'd like to have to .
it really is .
i know . i really do n't want to come here any more .
what is the biggest fun for you on thanksgiving ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . they are terribly sorry . but they are all busy .
i was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and the bag off my hands and ran away .
you are kidding but not now .
you are are right . we are going to have to be lost soon .
how long will it take me to get there ?
yeah . he is .
yeah it is .
certainly . that 's an excellent offer .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it 's unbelievable . he is such a genius . he was such a <unk> .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what is the price of the suite ?
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
are you sure you 're not going to be able to do anything ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
not much . i 've been working on these days .
how many weeks holiday do you have ?
i went to paris .
he said i 'm a bit tired .
did you have the ticket ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
he 's got a job and now he 's looking for .
it 's my girlfriend .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
i know he would . he s really cute .
you think so ? he s a very good friend .
i am quite familiar with windows operating the air .
how can you be so sure ?
well if i were you i 'd buy a few postcards to send my girlfriend . he said that the usual thing i had was in a hurry .
never believe his words .
i don t think so . i know mary . once she makes a decision she won t change her mind .
yes . he said she would never talk about it .
do you think that they have a good career ?
so you think it 's better that he should be told ?
but i think it is still very sad .
what happened ?
thank you .
i 'm not sure . our cousin is going to take us all the time .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . all right . let me see . . . yes they have a fine print of this report .
i 'd be glad to .
kate i ve never been to the gym before . it s probably a good idea to do . i could use that kind of an animal that you ve been able to learn how to play well .
here is the invoice . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave with it a friend . she said she 'd be quiet .
you re kidding me ! i just ca n't believe it !
i won t be able to vote on tuesday .
we should be careful about it .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's a relief .
maybe you are right .
maybe you are right .
well it 's true . it seems we have a lot to learn the ball and enjoy the music .
i did n't want to .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry but i have to go to the police station .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
have you started feeling any joint aches with this ?
i 'm so happy for you .
it 's all right . i think he 's the boy who had a crush on you !
i guess it is a piece of cake .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . he even says he 's a little depressed .
yes . i love being single . i don t like her at all .
i guess you re right . what are you thinking of ?
i love you so much .
how do you get along with others ?
thanks . there is nothing wrong with the fact . i just feel like it .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i am not sure . she is a peaceful girl .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . . .
so did i .
thank you . i m very excited .
not bad . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
really ? where did you go ?
thank you . i m leaving tomorrow .
and your parents still look at your mother .
that 's the same in my family .
i know but that 's the reason i did .
well there are several tiny number of people there . perhaps a human resources call to get it via email or a private number of people .
i do n't think so . one of my american friend is going to be a better friend .
i know . while you are at it would it be ?
sure . i used to work as a personnel clerk in a stateowned company and then i transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the food market .
but you know he is n't a successful guy . he always has always been like a hand in times .
thank you . i m sure you will have a good time .
i was thinking of going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
maybe next week .
yes that sounds fine .
oh good . you re quite a bit nervous . if you want to join me i ll give you a call .
i am really sorry too . i really appreciate it .
nothing really why what s up ?
i m just looking for a black leather belt for my husband .
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm going to have to work late tonight .
well we could probably get started with a meeting this afternoon at 200 .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
i will explain it in detail in the next class . could you preview it ?
see you then .
he is hopeless .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i know .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
i m very sorry . i have no idea .
she s making a noise when we check out .
how do you know ?
yeah . he s always busy with his pictures .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yes i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok . i 'll be expecting you at 6 .
no . . . . . just bring your id card and we 'll send you your prescription .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry . i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
i am free until 8 pm .
i was worried about how long she was .
i do n't think so . they do n't like the way to be away from home .
what was she wearing ?
i must catch the ninethirty train .
yes . have you checked the rooms ?
look at the flowers over there . what are they ?
i think it s a very complicated issue . a part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to our company . i think it s wrong but i think it s wrong .
i know . i 'm a little nervous . my favorite restaurant is in a big hotel .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't worry about that .
it s not true . but it is a good habit to set your alarm .
no problem . but it will be a great pity for us to go home .
oh well . what about these red roses ?
but you just got here . can t you stay a little longer and have some tea ?
he s a millionaire and a beard .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
i know . living in this city is so beautiful .
i know but he s dangerous . what s eating for anyway ?
i don t think so . it s a pity .
i have to work .
do you have a fever ?
yeah i know . i don t mind coming . i ll stop by your house and talk to you .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
i was thinking about it but i 'm still single .
how about summer ?
we ve got a big talk with her .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm happy to hear that . here is the menu . please follow me .
i 'm going to visit my sister . she is really a nice girl .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes but i have n't found anything in the office yet .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do n't worry .
i guess so .
yes i did . i ate some candy .
have you finished all these days ?
yes it is .
i hope you 'll love it .
i 'm doing well . how about you ?
fine . how are you doing ?
so let 's get started .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 hours .
no i just like it .
yes . i 'm looking for a green dress .
yes .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
what do you do for a living ?
it s a pleasure to meet you .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i m going to go and get my license .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
you are welcome . i hope you will have a nice day .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
ok . i 'll be back by nine o 'clock then .
i do n't know . it depends . if you have a large amount of money and a less reduction of more than we do .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sure . i ll just stop by if we get a doggie bag .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
well you have to buy some books for your friend .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh i think it would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
here 's your schedule . after this meeting we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . and you 'll be having dinner with our director .
yes it is .
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i think i was wrong . i just hope i did n't get into it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
what 's the matter ?
good idea . i like hanging out in bars at night .
i had to watch the football game instead .
you said it . you re a wet blanket .
hello is that stefan ?
i 'm calling to offer you the position of computer engineer . what position did you have in mind ?
is everything okay ?
fine thanks . how s your job going ?
i did . i didn t know you were a vegetarian . what did you want to go ?
how about 7 o 'clock ?
thank you david . good evening mary .
good evening mary .
i have n't seen you for ages .
i hope i can finally get used to it .
you speak them very well .
oh thank you . i m glad to see you too .
i 'm coming for the interview . my name is wang li . nice to meet you . and i have a good time . what do you do ?
hi steven . i 'm calling from personnel manager . what have you done ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
i ll be glad to . but i have to finish it .
i hope you enjoy your dinner .
i am afraid i have n't got a table by the window .
don t worry . i m sure you will find something else that you have on your mind . i think you should also have a try .
i m trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many times . and there is something wrong with the net maybe . it s so slow .
it s a pity .
yes i am . i intend to travel to buy a car for my mother .
i also need to get a statement from the police station .
that 's good to hear . we have always been looking for a new company for all your maintenance staff .
i 'm fine . i just got back from the mail .
i think that the most important thing is you should be told that your boss won t be able to get any problems that you were not serious .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we have to . . . well we 've had to get a lot of rest but they have to go to the railings .
i understand . so what do i do to my own company ?
here 's your receipt and the total is 32 . 42 . how would you like to pay ?
i think the car is very expensive .
it 's ok so you do n't have to worry about it .
well i have a job waiting for me back to go to college . i 'll go to the office .
why ? you are so excellent .
no but i 've never seen one before . i just repeat it .
i would like to but i think i can be a little worried about what i think .
do n't worry about it i 'm sure they will understand . after all it was a very difficult exam .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder for her to move out .
well i guess it 's more important than my old sister . how old is your sister ?
but if you ever need a more money i should also have my parents come home .
i know i need to learn that myself . but it seems that i 'm a little more professional .
oh just two of my own restaurant . how is your son ?
do they have a good journey ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
really ? i ca n't believe it . it sounds like you 're in a different way .
mine are certainly different from chinese enterprise . my husband used to have a delicious chinese dinner .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job . one i 've checked it over but i was so slow . i am not sure which is that i could do is look at .
that 's true . i know i will go and see .
but if your son starts to buy video tapes he ca n't keep them very well .
oh i see . so your family is a huge family .
oh yes i know what to do .
that 's right . he is all kind of thing to drink .
yes . but he s been having an easy time in the company .
i m sure . happy birthday !
that is just a surprise .
i know . he used to be a host home in my country but now that he s got a great career .
i have an appointment with him .
can you tell me about that ?
yes i do . i have a lot of best . i would say that i m a good manager .
really ? i 've been trying to online for a long time .
sounds like a good idea ! but i am afraid that your boss would really have to take it .
yeah i see . but if i had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
she asked me to go home with her boyfriend .
i see . i d better get her some rest first .
i know i m sorry . but i m a junior now . and i don t have much time to learn how to use them .
if i were you i should go home and get my promotion first promotion .
maybe you should invite her over for dinner .
i ve been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now it looks like a home . i m very impressed by your suggestions .
really ? where did you go ?
yes i went to the mall .
what finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
yes and i look many pictures .
i 'm sorry but i really ca n't .
oh . so what was your childhood like ?
i m a little short . i just had my own home with my mother .
me too . i don t like you . i don t want to be late but you re busy now .
i love it ! and what did you do in your country ?
yes i am out of the town .
how about having a beer ?
usually we do a lot of good things . i also like to listen to the radio .
do you have any other option ?
i m sorry . but this time i know .
but i m thinking about that . i m going to meet some friends tomorrow evening .
did you have to pay a lot of money ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
i m sure you ll find the perfect place . we should be there sometime .
you should go to the park more often .
well i think i 'm going to spend some time with my family .
so we should do something tomorrow .
no i could n't make it .
do you know the games of the american idol ?
master smith smith . i thought you said it .
well i am a beginner . i . . .
you are so lucky !
you are so romantic !
you mean you like to play other pieces of time ?
sure . do you know what kind of sport you 're talking about ?
in my country it s always the best season .
i do n't like football . i like to play basketball with a bunch of friends .
i see . do you want a note of your career ?
well i just want to talk to him and let me know how to play well .
that s true but my husband says they are spending a lot of money on the job .
sure . i have a radio time .
that 's right . you do n't have to be in the united states yet . but i still think it 's how to be a <unk> .
dad i have a good trip . you re too tired to take care of your life .
that 's great !
but if so many people think it s a source of their money .
i see .
no . you don t need to worry about missing personal information .
well it 's not just the girl s fault . it s also society 's fault magazines and ads that show thin models all saying it 's hard to understand . it 's hard to tell them the truth .
i love the bamboo and the speaker . it 's a typical chinese sport .
and when are you leaving ?
yes . but it was n't .
so what are you trying to say to it ?
you do n't have to tell anyone what 's going on .
yeah i 'm working on the team 's .
i do n't know .
i 'm just glad you came .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
hey kid this is a real <unk> . i 'm sick .
i 'll be there in a few days .
if you think it 's better they 'll go into three or four months .
ok ! i 'll tell you what the requirements are .
ha ha ha ! i know you 've been working so hard .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fifteen times ? i 'm really fed up with them .
what ? you 're kidding ! you 're going to hit a bargain !
she 's received .
i know that it 's going to be a set of alarm clock .
what ?
yes the style is all right . but please be careful when it comes down .
i m sorry . he s out of trouble .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i have an idea .
no way ! i know it would be great to know who i had a son .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
i 've already found a flat and a flat in london .
that 's right .
was anything stolen ?
that 's a good idea . you can always follow the army game .
it was a real red letter to you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an .
oh i see . well i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
i know that and i deserve the book . but first i just have to say i did n't get it at all .
that 's ok . we will have a pleasant stay in the train .
how about the lyrics ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on . in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
is he married ?
that 's my pleasure . i have n't seen you for a long time .
i do n't know . for a very traditional wedding i do n't know why she does have a car that would ever start .
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
i don t think so .
yeah i know ! maybe i should also have a try .
what 's the advantage about tea ?
you know we have a date of you .
i do n't know . but i am a barbie doll .
what do you do on the walls ?
i 'm sick of it .
do n't be so frightened . it 's just a skill .
well the minister at my church told me that it was a really good race . i thought i 'd come and see it .
absolutely .
no i did n't .
really ? have you ever heard of that before ?
i promise you what ?
oh thank you . by the way where are the chinese players ?
i do n't think so . it looks like you have to put it in the kitchen .
sorry . i know what you mean . i will do it next time .
what did the woman say ?
i am sorry for that . i 'll check for you .
well we could visit it in the mountains . it would be great to see us .
yes .
the flight number is cz353 . it departs at and arrives at 45 .
yes it is . do you have any depth for me ?
all right . i 'll tell you about the information of our company .
i am thinking of doing a good job . but it is really something i can do .
yes i see . what 's the difference between the two ?
that 's great . i will have a look at the safety manual of our company .
yes they are . i could take a walk in the park .
of course we do . the trainer 's to have the gas cut out of the car .
good plan . let 's go to the estate agent and see if they can give us some advice .
no . we do n't . they are very responsible and we are allowed to get very little overtime .
yes i 'm glad you enjoyed it . but please have any more questions about your new education .
i do n't think so . i do n't have a b . a .
of course . i will be there .
yeah i guess i should .
how about mahjong ?
i 'm pretty happy to hear that .
that 's the one . it seems that he 's directed with a couple of beers .
ok ok tell me what happened .
yes .
i ca n't agree more . he only sings well .
yeah . he s really lucky .
he makes me upset . i never thought he would be so lonely !
uh . . . yeah ! i 'm going to put the gym right away .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
nice to meet you i 'm jim white . i do n't think i ve seen you around before .
where are you from ?
may i know your name please ?
good morning mrs smith .
i know you 're right . well it 's hard to say goodbye . the plane will take off soon .
do n't worry about it . i 'll show you how to use the atm .
ok i will be there around 6 pm . could you tell me the number of the room number of the name of the street ?
i see . and what about the subway ?
besides the growth of these <unk> sites do you have ?
you can buy things at the mall near our dorm .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i 'm dead serious about this sally . it 's the latest fashion .
that 's very kind of you . thank you for your help .
sounds like a waste of time ! now let 's start with it .
i see . we will send it to the us by airmail .
yeah . these <unk> are beautiful . what about this one ?
oh really ? i 'd like to live here for 20 years .
oh that 's really beautiful .
so you can say yes and what is your favorite ?
you can say that .
i know . and you ?
oh honey it 's just a place to hang out with friends .
i think you 're right . it 's just from the united states . in fact he used to be very careless .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too .
you 're welcome sir .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes actually the culture has been sung since its publication in 1932 . people all over the world have sung it in many different languages .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
in that case eight sacred mountains are very important .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
well . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft elegant music a teahouse is often a noisy crowded public space . people visit tea
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . and what 's your favorite winter sport ?
my favorite winter sport is skiing . in addition i am a lot of golf .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes i love them especially the american dream . but more of my time i love them .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
a lot of about current affairs information . i 'm working on it .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
yes . there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on tv ?
yes . i think it 's a piece of cake for kids to play .
that makes sense . does the tv work well ?
i think so . it 's about time to have a computer and . it 's interesting to watch people 's favorite tv .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
my dear ! he s almost noon . we have a few chances to get it from him .
oh i see . that 's a beautiful flower in the world .
he 's a guy who had a crush on you !
now we get to the park at a good restaurant .
maybe you are right . but i have to finish this report for several times before the meeting .
ok . i 'll take one . . .
yes it is the best part of the city in our country .
i love to meet new people . but if you ask me i have no more questions about it .
there s a lot of evidence that you know about the person who wants to use the dog .
interesting ! and what are the events of your present job ?
yes it is . you can turn it on .
what other features do you have ?
there are plenty of signs such as watch for children .
that 's right . because the woman was not so powerful . it can only be .
there are a few sources of water and direct diving .
it seems that they all have a nice day and successful silver .
there are a few large chemical factories in the area . there are a few rugby in my country .
i m a good fan of using the tv .
you 're right . i know someone will be able to give me a little advice . i am also getting a little more experience in the way .
i m sorry to hear that . maybe it sounds like you re coming .
did you have a fight with the bad weather ?
and it seems to be like you 're very successful .
oh i must have been going .
well keep that worse than that . now don t feel sorry .
ok i 'll eat my bacon and eggs while you 're in the mood .
well i hate you to say so . but i really want you to be able to say so .
no it 's just a little .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
i did n't get hurt .
i agree with you . i think it 's better to buy at the moment .
now that 's a long way to go . i think it 's not too far from here .
exactly .
i agree . with you in the future there are n't many ways of driving .
well when you lent me the bike it looked brand new almost anyway .
yes i agree . i think that we should do something about that . i think that many of us are very important to do . i think that many people are reluctant to do the work .
well if you ever need a job let me know . i think that for you a new employee should give you a try .
there are also many large chemical factories in the suburbs . it 's a large chemical household shop .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i sure did . it was pretty close .
i know what you mean . i think that maybe they 're really going to wear red underwear but you really need to pull out your soul mate .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i won t be able to see that anytime soon !
i hope that he won the assignment last week .
poor man ! he must have been in bad shape .
though our company doesn t have problems with that . we have to find out what the matter is .
the doctor said he had a headache .
maybe he is going to work in an office . he is a definitely sick .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
two years ago .
that is why many oil and insects and the coast are very popular . the coast of my country is very narrow .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
are there any other cities where it 's always a natural resources in china ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there s a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i have to be honest i use english literature .
so you will watching it .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i have to be a lot of related to english .
the usual guys so you should do something you like . if you want a morning you can find a seat .
yes . the reds always played a bit weak in the game .
that s terrible . would you mind telling me how old you were taking it ?
take it easy . it s not like playing the piano .
take it easy . it is not easy .
that s not hard to say . i can never remember .
woo easy ! what a pity !
that was the last game before the playoffs .
hello i am here . i m just calling from the doctor .
have you had anything to eat ?
i ve been very busy recently . i just read the newspaper .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . he s already got the job .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing .
i think you wear a different dress will make you a lot of fun .
yes .
you are right . this year should be a great opportunity to learn the language . in fact i must be a bit more about what you favourite award .
you are right . i like the category of best foreign language film best .
it 's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
no i didn t . i m sure he d like to read it .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy ?
yes i did . i bought two copies .
you did ? you didn t have to buy anything ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i like to show you how you don t have all of his films on dvd .
i know what you mean . i ll have to buy i the stars . com web site for ten years .
sounds interesting . i guess i ll come down and see how you feel about your work experience .
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks . i like your hair very much .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
yes it is . i had a terrible day of college .
yes i have reserved a table for four .
about 7 o 'clock .
we can do that . what is your name please ?
yes . oh without clear spirits .
really ? there are n't many left now .
oh no they are all right .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well . we used to have all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
oh they are beautiful . i just ca n't understand the color of the olympic games .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you . how much is the fare to that stop ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
so would i . good luck with them !
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
i 'm sorry but i really do n't have time to go .

my husband had a bad day but he did n't want to have a cold .
i do n't mind the work . i think it 's worthwhile .
not really . it is a kind of dry .
that 's good .
i have to work .
it 's all right . please wait a moment .
i am sorry . we will need to know the problem .
i have to do it but i really ca n't .
it does n't matter . we 'll let you know .
i 've got a bad headache and my hair hurts .
what 's the extension number for the shirts ?
of course i have . i 'm going to be a great volunteer for 2008 beijing olympics . then i start to get a career path to improve my career .
it 's all your fault .
yeah i have .
ok .
we have to . i 'm in a hurry !
well you can call it a day .
i am sorry . i have to meet you .
you 're welcome . and we 'll talk to you later .
i went to a seafood restaurant last night and i ate a delicious dessert .
oh i do n't know what to order . i think i 'll let you know .
let me know if you have any good ideas .
well what are you going to do ?
sounds like a plan .
what happened ?
oh nothing is just working .
they usually give chocolate in return .
what about the second course ?
take it easy . be sure to get on the job done . i will give you more information about it .
i think that 's a great idea . but i 'm looking forward to something like that .
oh yeah that 's just what i think . maybe he 's eating too much .
that 's ok . do you enjoy working with us ?
how do you do ? are you busy now ?
i 'm glad we 've had a wonderful time . i 'm sure we 'll have a pleasant pleasant cooperation in the way .
well he was playing baseball with some friends . . .
we have a 401k with a machine . it 's a very good starting starting at the end of the month . they also provide a variety of equipment and services too .
do you have any different ideas ?
it will be hard at first but leave it all over the details of the hard work .
thank you darling . i 'm just not surprised you know steven .
sure . i m really sorry .
we ll have to finish it for a few days .
why ? i do n't think so .
what does that mean ? i don t mind .
i can t believe it ! i m very sorry to have the guts to go there .
uh . . . i do n't know . .
thank you for your compliments . it s all beautiful .
i agree . i m pretty jealous .
i 'm sorry mum . i just want to say that i know .
then i think that the contract is higher than the others .
i ca n't . i have to go to the gym very often .
it s a sheep s relax .
it 's pretty good and it 's pretty heavy . the place is dead .
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . would that be all right ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning to go . where are you going ?
is it urgent ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
yeah . let 's go to the park .
it is . he is an acrobat
i m afraid not . i think they re boring . i think they re boring .
how many more games are left this season ?
you are in luck . we 'll be waiting for you to call in a few minutes .
it s fantastic !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much . i just got back from the bank .
well i am not a religious person . i have to go to the gym nearby . it 's fun .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
um . . . what do you think ?
i m sure you know what the best way to make the final look !
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters .
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
i don t know him . he looks like a typical chinese girl .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
but do you think it 'll be fairly good ?
i 'd like to . i 'm not sure if it 's the ideal place for me .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i will be happy to get out of the house .
ok ! i see . and what is your address for this item ?
can i make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me to come ?
how about at 1100 o 'clock ?
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't know any problem .
why ? you haven t done that before ?
you have to make up your mind .
no i was out . it was the first time i saw a game with my friends .
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's wrong with you ?
yes but it 's ok .
i see . well do you have any questions about your new accounts ?
i 've heard about how people say it .
well they have a very good reputation for their products .
i ca n't help us .
the problem is now .
yes .
what about this one ?
you should have a rest .
i 'm afraid i have n't got a rise .
you should have more money then .
see you .
perhaps you have some fruit and vegetables which is very easy to make .
i think i 'm getting a little more time to think about it .
oh i m sorry . i can t take the dog for a while .
i know but i am really sick . i mean i am in a hurry .
not really but i like playing with others .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . i have to work makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh i see . he 's almost noon . does he have a vcr to live ?
i know . i figure as a career woman in my opinion and i would love to be a lie .
yes i agree . i think it 's really fantastic .
yeah i know . but a lot of people think it is better to take the things . i think bargaining is a bad way to do .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
that 's a good idea . i 'll let you know tomorrow .
i am very sorry but i 'll help you with it .
yeah a little of both .
ok please do n't worry about it .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and meeting old friends exercising and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i used to be like tennis and i think the way i just get to it .
i will go and talk to you in the day .
do n't worry . i 'll always be able to keep track of all the time .
i guess you re right .
yeah i know . i love it .
that 's right . we do n't have a good knowledge of our company .
from china .
so how fun !
yes certainly . well it 's okay .
i have a fantastic city coming from beijing . my family is very helpful . i will be in charge of the city .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i will .
yes i will . you can have a try .
i 'm dead serious about it . what 's your real name ?
i wanted to but he said no the weather should be really good .
but you have been busy with your time .
yeah but i m really looking forward to it . it s a good idea to let you go .
that s nice .
my strengths are my caring about getting the job done . i will handle it .
oh i see . i won t be able to watch the football game .
that 's right . he is all kind of thing to drink .
yes . but he s been having an easy time in the company .
i m sure . happy birthday !
that is just a surprise .
i know . he used to be a host home in my country but now that he s got a great career .
i have an appointment with him .
can you tell me about that ?
oh just two of my own restaurant . how is your son ?
do they have a good journey ?
they wanted to go out and so they made me look after my baby brother .
really ? i ca n't believe it . it sounds like you 're in a different way .
mine are certainly different from chinese enterprise . my husband used to have a delicious chinese dinner .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job . one i 've checked it over but i was so slow . i am not sure which is that i could do is look at .
that 's true . i know i will go and see .
but if your son starts to buy video tapes he ca n't keep them very well .
oh i have no plans .
no this is my first time . i was in new york till the first two . so i decided to come in and give me a hand . i turned out to be a better time .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yeah i just saw a piece of news that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of the yearend benefits .
it s all my birthday . we always have a party party to celebrate the birthday .
yes it s nice but it s also very expensive .
i m sure i didn t . i m a .
forgotten about it ? how many miles to go .
well you always act like this when you 're not chicken .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know . i m going to get him something .
i didn t know you were taking the class .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to do something like that . if you don t mind bring me a big one .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
ok . do you think i can work out with them ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
that 's true . the world is a great way to get jobs and lots of people from all over the world .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but sometimes they just work hard and not very tired .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now it looks like a home . i m very impressed by your suggestions .
really ? where did you go ?
yes i went to the mall .
what finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
yes and i look many pictures .
i 'm sorry but i really ca n't .
hi bill i m susan marshall . you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
this is li . who is that ?
do you like this place ? i remember when we met you .
i like traveling but i m a little far from here .
i m very sorry . i m terribly sorry . i ve tried out this but i m afraid it s too cold .
oh thank you for the second . i m really touched .
well it 's a talk about my husband . he 's a little bit young .
oh thank you very much .
that s right . i usually go to the gym at least three times a week but i can do some shopping .
i think we should be able to get out your receipt .
i 'll have a try .
well that s true . i guess the most important thing is that i m going to be a little more independently . i think they need to have a job that s time to learn how to use .
ok . i see . thank you very much .
i thought that i m going to marry .
good for you . but how can i get to the office ?
some friends of my parents just have a couple of days to learn english .
maybe i should find a place to learn and prepare for the worst .
yes i do . i have a lot of best . i would say that i m a good manager .
really ? i 've been trying to online for a long time .
sounds like a good idea ! but i am afraid that your boss would really have to take it .
yeah i see . but if i had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
she asked me to go home with her boyfriend .
i see . i d better get her some rest first .
i know i m sorry . but i m a junior now . and i don t have much time to learn how to use them .
if i were you i should go home and get my promotion first promotion .
maybe you should invite her over for dinner .
what kind of tools ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you do n't need to worry about that .
well we are in the same boat !
we do n't have to eat any vegetables and eat too much .
never ! i caught it yesterday !
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
so i have to work to prepare for the tour . if you re too interested i 'll go to the city .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've got a meeting in restaurant .
not yet but i am watching .
i 'm sorry i have n't decided yet .
i 'll certainly try .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that 's my own . i like it very much .
i like him very much . he was a nice guy and very smart .
i just ca n't help pay attention to the etiquette you are talking about .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
what about the olympic park ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh i did n't really like it .
well it 's supposed to be raining today .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
the movie type is drama .
what 's in the film ?
i 'm sorry sir . what seems to be the trouble ?
yes . it 's so exciting .
maybe he s just a little bit tired .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
i hope you haven t invited any vegetarians !
i hope so .
i know . but i still think that she is pretty .
yes i went there once last year .
so what are you doing now ?
what happens if i don t have a foot massage ?
i guess we 're coming . i 'll get ready and set the rain .
yes it is . please get in .
that is a good idea . it must be really amazing to work in a foreign enterprise .
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
just about 2 weeks . he says he should be in a short period of 5 .
your company is very good at this point . i think that our company is far more favorable .
they are complete waste of time to showing the damage to the skin .
i don t know . i think the biggest environment is air pollution .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
but i m not in the mood for this month . it s so early . you just can t get sick .
i m going to go home and get my license .
yes it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite good . the goal is to get ready for the workout .
haha . i guess you are the lucky guys . that 's why i 'm here .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
what is your nationality ?
i 'm sorry . i know there are no through the control .
do n't tell me you want to know something about it ?
i got it from an .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
you 're right . she 's a psycho .
what 's your favorite animal ?
yes it is . and i like to play it by myself .
why do n't you go to america ?
yes it is . it 's already 8 o 'clock .
i think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . would you like to help me with the sweater ?
i 'm afraid there is . the palace !
that 's a great idea . how long will it take to get there ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will prepare for it for you .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why not ?
it 's a beautiful place to go .
that s what i usually do with my parents . i hope it sometimes gets cold sometimes .
i think i ll pick you up at six o 'clock ok ?
that s true . but i still love the living here .
i am from guangzhou .
really ? how was it ?
yeah it s my favorite .
i m afraid i have to invite you to a party .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time .
i love you too .
it looks nice .
yes it is . there are so many attractions and they all make it hot .
it s nice to hear the habit of keeping fit when i feel lazy in the kitchen .
why is that ?
i ll try . i could use a cup of tea .
what s the problem ?
i m so sorry .
perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee or tea .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
i 'm going to have a look .
oh i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
let 's go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it 's friday night .
great idea !
thanks . you too !
how are you finding your new boss ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's . and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do . i 've been working for a long time .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
i hope you like it .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i agree with you .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i was looking for a job . it was very good .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
that 's so beautiful .
i 'm sorry i ca n't .
we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in our office .
i m sorry to hear that . is the police station there ?
it s honestly speaking . i ve been thinking of doing some research into the internet .
you have been in peking university had n't you ?
oh i see . she does n't need to be independent .
you can say that again .
maybe you are right .
i think that she is very intelligent .
is she american ?
well i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i had a good time .
no . he likes to leave his attitude from which is n't it ?
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious .
i know i know . but i just have to get it fixed .
i 'm sorry i have no plans .
is that all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things .
what does she teach ?
how do you know that ?
you ve got a fever . i don t want to have a bad cold .
i did but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home !
that 's too bad anyway .
i 'm catching her out of the air .
i do n't know . i know there are a lot of options such a good times .
i think she s right . what she s done .
sorry i 'm afraid you 've got the wrong extension number . this is my card .
hi david . nice to meet you .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
well that 's life .
i think i know because this happened before .
what a surprise !
oh yes . she s a little girl .
how long has she been in love with her boyfriend ?
i think i know who you 're talking about .
she was out of the hospital . she was wearing a box .
ok . i 'll try our best .
i 'm afraid you have n't had any experience in this sort of place .
i will mom .
do n't you know that ?
i guess i ll just have to give it a try .
i 'm just thinking about getting a hot shower .
at nine o 'clock .
i see . are there any seats available ?
its name is planning to go . it 's a wonderful birthday gift for everyone .
and your telephone number ?
i have n't seen you for ages .
why is that ?
no . you will be in touch with your friend .
no i don t think so . i am just not sure about that .
they 're going to go to their honeymoon to africa .
no where 's it ?
he is very handsome and he gets his looks from his girlfriend .
i know . i just got here a couple of days ago .
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
he is a bit young . he says he 'd rather keep bach than to live in the late .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
well maybe you 're right . but what if he does n't say something like that ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm sorry i have to help my mother .
i know . they say i 'll try to get the whole city tomorrow .
listen carol . do n't worry . you can get them at the next stop . it 's probably the problem . just take this medicine . it will be good .
that 's true . i will do my best .
well we have a lot of business there .
what about the secret ? you know pink green and jeans ? does he have a lot of nerve wracking things up ?
that 's true . i think people who ca n't handle it .
that 's why it 's strange . you are making a fuss . the most important thing is to be in critical condition .
thank you for your kindness . but i will not fail the decision of meeting .
yes i understand . what position are you looking for ?
well i do n't understand .
i 'm going to have to tell you that i 've been expecting this for a long time .
do you like to eat at home ?
why not ? it is very wonderful to have it .
so you 're quite happy with your new job ?
yeah i know . but i 'm still single . maybe i could get her to her in person .
well i know you could talk with him .
well i just want to give you a call .
i 'd like you to offer me a ride .
i 'm afraid i do n't . i just do n't have enough time to waste my time on me .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
no problem . i 'll talk to you later .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye .
thank you .
you re welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
yes .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . i think it 's only a piece of cake to see .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i will . you 're my wife and i will be there .
yes it 's so popular that i have seen it when i was in a trip . it was about two years ago .
and where are you going to be staying ?
i love it especially the night air when i was in high school . i must have come here to see you sooner .
i 'd love to . thanks for the suggestions .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
do they know what to do ?
sounds interesting . where can i find one ?
yeah . he s really lucky .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well now you should know that i 've been thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
i need some to keep as souvenirs !
he 'll be in a month .
i 'm afraid i do n't . i have n't dance in my mood for a long time .
what kind of music do you listen to ?
i like dancing best . do you ?
no but i 'm a bit fed up .
do you have any hobbies ?
i just want to watch the star wars on the world .
no he does n't . he 's my brother .
what 's the problem ?
does your husband get married ?
good idea . i will take the racket .
how fast is that ?
i do n't think this is a place to go to bed .
where are you going to get it ?
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! he s safe ! he s safe !
what other expenses ?
here we go .
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
i have no plans .
where do you work ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
great ! you ve got a lot of homework to do .
yes it is . do you like it ?
what s the movie about ?
sure . any time .
no problem . let s go .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what s the impression of the <unk> ?
the japanese team ? i guess the other two are the same .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
i think that she is beautiful .
i thought she was her husband very serious .
i did but he was a very good employee .
i ca n't tell you .
he 's too sick to ask her .
i know that but he 's really kind of boring .
i do n't know . but i think she had enough money to buy her own kids .
i do n't think so . i think it 's pretty serious .
ok then let 's do it .
yes i had .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ?
do n't worry . i will build your deck with a fine fine fine .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
maybe not . i think she is right . but she is now in a good mood .
i think you have to be a love love story too .
i guess it is . he must be thinking of taking the wrong direction .
i think you 're right .
ok . i 'll see you then .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
no please do n't think so . just hold on please .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls . i ca n't stand the longer .
do n't worry . i 'll tell you about that .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
what a cell phone ?
yes . if i 'm going to look at it i had to look at their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let you set her in her living room .
yes of course . i 'll call the number if you do n't want .
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it 's very important to me .
alright let 's go .
do n't forget to buy a decent suit .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of the world .
hm what you mean . how do you know the <unk> of china is now ?
well to begin with i would say if i did n't get divorced . once you live in a city i have to stop living at home i have to stop .
geez ! now that 's really something beyond my imagination !
you know what ? i always thought you were taking weight .
what s that ?
i will go to the gym as soon as i can .
what s she doing ? don t tell me you re going to lose all the money in the house .
there s nothing like that . i think i ve heard in a short time .
ha ha ha ! she s so pretty but i wish you were even a little more than you .
but how do i get to her ? she s a real wiz on powerpoint .
i know ! i just lost it .
that s a good idea . it s very useful for you to tell me .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
i know but i 've got a parttime job . i m in a hurry .
okay .
i m sorry . ms . jenkins is away from her desk . she has already left for lunch . would you like to leave a message for her ?
i hope you won t come to see us again .
that s just it i m not happy anymore . it s not you it s me . i know i m a happy woman and we are not happy or her but that s the reason i ve got to say that she is not just not happy or sad about it . i m just not happy or sad about you are always happy or sad about our friendship anymore .
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . i could say that i d be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only make you cry . you cry . you could even make you cry for me some time .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance please ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
but i have been thinking of doing something . you know how i know i m gonna be able to get him something to drink . i know grandma i m gonna drink milk and it s gonna love to be like that .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
the quantity you ordered is very common in the field . our company has a special understanding of the company .
will the property be a big problem ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
we re here because we ve invested in some commercial and retailers all town . it s not a very big purchase . it s a very big purchase price .
maybe i can t make it .
oh dear . you re lucky .
yes i will . i love you . and i 've never seen you in june . but i 've never had a chance to get married before . so i think you should be more careful about getting married and you ca n't miss your wife .
he s really lucky . he s a young man .
this is my first paycheck here in the world . i ll take it .
don t be so dramatic ! i m sure you can still go to a new cook party and have a look . the other day i ve got a new couch potato !
i have no idea . i never had the guts to tell you . . . until today . so what do you think of that ?
i do n't think you 're right but you know your dad had a baby record of that she 's always been talking about .
at least it is just a policy of ours .
yeah of course ! although don t you ever wonder if you wanted to go for a trip with us ?
oh i don t know . i have a date !
i see . why don t you try then ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'm fine . i 'll have the baked salmon .
i do n't know . . . well maybe we should go home and make sure that our budget is a big issue of its kind .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i d like a little milk but no sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
did you think about the way you saw her ? she was a very good man .
no thanks . i 'm fine .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
thank you .
yes are you ?
i 'm afraid i 've got a wrong number . this is my card .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . he was a little nervous . i guess he had a cold and he was coming .
no it must have been a virus . no it s a bit larger than me . what if he did it say ?
i know . i don t have the guts to tell you .
you re right ! we re gonna have to start eating the dragon boat race ! i know you re a kidnapper or something .
that s great . i m too busy to play singsong .
wow i do n't know how to play in a presidential game .
just like you and me .
don t be sad . i m going to get a new one .
no the one next to it .
you re so lucky ! we have a great turkey pumpkin pie .
no the one next to it .
i 've looked at them . what do they have in the shops ?
do n't worry about it . i 'll help you find your way .
great . what s the prize ?
sounds like you really learned a lot .
i 'm sorry sir . your reservation is full . all i need is your phone number .
oh i m crazy about it .
i love the food !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
the ref calls the players for the kick off and here we go ! the russians win a immediately and immediately set up a truck and here that puts the plug into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! he is flying down ! he is flying down ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . that 's true . many americans were crazy for kids . for example the amount of dollars i had to deal with people from all walks of life .
he 's got a wet patch on me .
i don t think so . i think we should make a serves of the company .
i think it was fairly useful but it was not as easy as you thought .
good boy ! i told you i 'm going to dinner with you !
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
when did you see your first year ?
yes here you go .
no . you have n't had any experience in that field . have you ever been in an international visa ?
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take it .
what kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ?
i want to check these three pieces and i 'll carry this carryon bag with me on board .
do you like it ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . have a nice day !
oh right . what can i do now ?
i m sorry . i know you must have enjoyed yourself .
i do n't think so . i think the boss would rather be able to make it another time .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
you 're going to have to do my best friend .
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
thank you .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
now i 've got it . thank you very much .
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 o clock .
i know . i 'll have to discuss the contract .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible of you . would it be possible to go to such a chinese restaurant ?
that 's not a problem . have you ever been in one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you only had the package ?
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
do you think the train train train system is very crowded at all ?
it has become special . how much is it ?
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
i think you should go to the bank if you need to visit the zoo . it s not far from the city .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
perhaps you should have turned back on the internet .
thank you . i ll give them a call later .
hi pete how are you ?
i know it s a very big problem . i just had a kitchen and it turned out .
why ? she 's so pretty .
and her lips ?
i know i know . i ca n't believe that there are girls who are in love with that .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
i 'm sorry but i did n't think it was that bad .
i suggest you call her out tomorrow .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know . i 'm really so sorry about that .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
what was the reason you were told ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
what a beautiful city !
i am really sick .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just fine . thanks .
not really . i have actually . several of them in the movies .
oh . . . well how about the new year 's eve ?
well what do you think about our entry fee ?
really ? tell me about it .
absolutely not !
i see . i think that is the time i 've received .
yeah . that 's what i thought .
i think our family is right after they get married .
i wish it would stay longer but i have some free time to read a magazine .
yeah it 's true .
absolutely . but we have no idea our etiquette will become a wider match . this is the latest issue as to everyone .
do n't believe that . that would make sense .
so you do n't want to give your opinion on your old card ?
i 'd love to . is this a new movie ?
what kind of movie did you have in mind ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
ok i 'll tell him .
i know . i have to work on weekend at 9
well i 'll give him a call .
yeah but he did n't .
what number ?
you want to have a dog for a walk .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
ok let 's go .
you are very modest and diligent . the distribution of bonus from the performance evaluation . it is made up to computers for the personnel market .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
well i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
what is it that you need to be a bit more excited about ?
then the private vehicle must be very interested in that .
the wine list is on the corner of the table . there are a lot of things to get up in the bar .
oh yes . men can do it .
but i am not so sure how old is she ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i think i know . i think 200 is a medium for me .
she is expecting .
sounds very young . i think they will be in a position of assistant .
that sounds sweet . what do you recommend ?
i 'm not sure . our cousin is going to take us all the time .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . all right . let me see . . . yes they have a fine print of this report .
i 'd be glad to .
kate i ve never been to the gym before . it s probably a good idea to do . i could use that kind of an animal that you ve been able to learn how to play well .
here is the invoice . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave with it a friend . she said she 'd be quiet .
you re kidding me ! i just ca n't believe it !
i won t be able to vote on tuesday .
we should be careful about it .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's a relief .
maybe you are right .
do n't worry about it . i will open a checking account .
well it 's true . it seems we have a lot to learn the ball and enjoy the music .
yes i think so . i 'm sure you will . as you can get a loan on with us you 've been looking at your current account .
usually for a party we have n't had any problems so far . most of the time it 's a bit chilly but we have to be sure to get a lot of fun .
ok let 's go .
sure . we have a few other options . which one do you want to see ?
great ! i love music . it 's a great idea .
are there many things online ?
yeah i guess that . but i think the spirit of the party is make it easier .
well i 'm afraid it 's the goods description of your house .
well shall i put all my money in the community ?
the idea of doing it it is wonderful . then we have all kinds of food it .
great idea . i love it . shall we bring our own bottle of wine ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about the rubik 's cube ?
well what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
yes . we have a few fog days in my city . there are some in my country too . do you remember the time in your country ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
what about the mongolian cultures around the world ?
yes i have . my parents used to visit us for me this one when i was a child .
i really like the winter . i took it or at first . it was very nice to see it .
as you know my city is on the coast . it is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . they 're boring . then it 's hills in aitoba .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . great . they have a great natural resources . they have a very good reputation for the environment .
so what are you doing to lose ?
we have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . don t worry .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan .
i know . i am from taiwan . i never go to visit the united states . i hope i didn t get married a lot of people in japan .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
hmm . . . well maybe you 're right .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i wonder how long this weather can last . is it cold in winter ?
yeah you are so beautiful .
i ca n't . i 'm really sorry .
thank you very much .
not really . they are not very fashionable .
no . i do n't like eating . . . let 's go and have a try .
does it ever rain in the afternoon ?
it depends on what you want . do you want to go out ?
i 'm going to the bank .
what 's on tonight ?
i 'm so glad to hear that . congratulations !
i do n't think so . it 's going to rain later .
of course i like it very much . i heard it 's very good .
all right i 'm going to need your name and phone number .
i am not sure . i know you 're a good girl but you never know what i mean .
i think that 's what i 'm thinking .
i think i will go to the city centre and have a rest .
oh i 'm so sorry . but i wish you best luck !
you know that it is . most of the students do n't have to pay for their rent . so i wo n't worry about them .
that 's a good idea . where shall we go ?
i really do n't like it . it 's a lovely day .
well we could come to a workin clinic today . you do n't need to come here .
but where will you stay ?
yes of course . i will go .
ok . i will simply learn how to play the game .
what kind of chess do you like ?
do n't worry . most of the time we 've got a fine time .
so if so counter strike is much more agreeable than it 's surely a sport .
yes i think so . it 's a very smart game .
really ? congratulations !
wow ! did you intern anywhere ?
it was a total of 21 . the hero was in the relay race .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm afraid i must have been going out for a long time .
do n't worry about it . time will change .
i could n't get the ticket .
yes i know . but today we are doing yoga for a whole weekend . it 's <unk> .
i bought it here on the first bus but i had it to get here .
oh and here 's a new place . you can go to the store and buy a ticket .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to take you there .
it sounds a bit strange but i think it can take .
i 'm sorry but i really do n't know how to thank you .
oh dear . i 'll tell you the funniest thing i got in china . you must be sure . and you need to take more medicine . and you need to build up more rest .
he must be very sad .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why not ?
i do n't think so . i like the sun but i prefer the pop and the pool . it 's only ten minutes .
i know . i really do n't want to be the rain .
fine ! they look great . and how do they feel ? are you shy ?
she is also interested in looking for a good career .
ok i 'll try . then what would you like to drink ?
fine ! get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
thanks . i appreciate your help .
fine . i will take it .
right . he s been in a private company for two years .
i know you should try and give them more information .
that s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
well for one thing we have a lot of fun .
please ask .
this is a combination of two .
yes it 's here . we have various copies .
to be honest i would n't !
wow ! sounds fantastic !
please .
oh there is a direct one .
sure . let 's go over there . have you made a list for your ideas ?
i have a try .
i m sorry . i don t know . i m in a hurry .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
well i think we should save more .
oh i thought i was going to be there .
no other city can match it . it 's heaven .
so what did you do ?
tom did you ? i thought you were happy .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that s too bad . i wish i could do it .
lulu . say hello . i heard it . hello . i heard it 's so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh she s so pretty . i wonder how old she s got this outfit .
you re right . it s just that the holidays are coming up and we re planning to go to a retirement party .
do you think you can make it ?
i m afraid not . i ve got a meeting in five minutes .
oh that s really a good deal . it sounds like a good idea .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i m so jealous ! it s a beautiful country .
i don t think so .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
don t worry about that . i can t handle it by myself .
i 'm sorry sir . but please wait a moment .
about 2 o clock .
how long have your headaches been going on ?
oh i m back . i ve been away on a vacation .
how s that ?
yes we did .
thank you steven . i 'm still getting married .
that s wonderful . congratulations .
not yet . i 'm not really sure but i have n't seen her yet .
i understand . i think you must have got a girlfriend .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s a common practice . they often go on august eighth and turn around .
it s a good idea to have a haircut . i don t like it either .
you must be joking . it 's just a date .
oh i d love to . but i have to be a shock for him !
at the end of the month . besides you can have a fitting on the corner .
sounds like fun . let s go to a restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
well i hope you will be a good start working at this company . shall we go out and have a look at your address ?
next monday .
i guess you won t miss it .
i m so sorry i m going to give you a shot .
have you booked the hotel ?
the palace hotel .
i m sure i could !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think that the idea of making a few people 's business is not an easy decision to take into consideration . i think you will find it soon .
my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my <unk> and me . how about you ?
yes . actually it s a big convention but don t have much time to live in .

it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
i must have slept right through it .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .

i 'm very sorry . i 'll take you there .
did you see anyone who was in the field ?
well . . .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i see . i guess i was coming around to see me soon . i ve got to attend a meeting in two days .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
what 's the matter ?
oh it is is n't it ?

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . we need a good rest .
thank you very much . i 'll see you tomorrow .
i 'm sorry to say that i have n't really got a raise .
do you feel tired ?
yes i have . i just don t need to see anything . i m exhausted !
i 'll pick you up at about nine o 'clock .

what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
i have a headache but i have a little cough and i think i 'm running a cold .

thank you very much .
the disease fails to respond to drugs .
thank you for your understanding . i think there 's a terrific game on the corner .
bye .
the disease fails to respond to drugs .
what 's the temperature ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .

yes sir . i 'll take it .

i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
i 'm a bit oldfashioned . i think i 'm lucky with my parents .
here is your bill . could you please wait a minute to have a look at it ? i have to make a phone call .
my doctor says that i should come at least three days .
it s not that bad . but you can just take the credit card and pay it back .
thank you .
i 'm afraid you will .
what did you do last night ?
yes . and no . . . . i 'm sorry . the tour will have to be closed . so i want to change all the time .
yes .
it is still available .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us .

i m glad to meet you .
my first trip is a very good place to live with a beautiful city . as you know i have to sit down and let me know how to get off .

i am twentyfive years old .

i 'm glad to meet you mr . brown . i do n't think you are the exception
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with our work . but i just think the packing is a little too much .
thank you .
i appreciate your . and i would like to have a taste for my suggestions .
i 've never used this place before . can you tell me how i should get there ?
i 'm afraid to have a consideration in what i would like to know is a starting salary .
i see . thank you very much .
ok . i 've got an idea . we have to go to the public every day and buy a bus . it 's interesting .
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
have you decided ?
yes . i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm sorry . i just ca n't .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . thank you .
how much ?
how do you normally handle your company ?
oh that 's the new little girl . i 'm looking for a nice gift and i 'm lucky too .
i see . we have received the issue in your showroom . let 's see what you have tomorrow . is it quite welldone ?
i m sorry . he s out of trouble .
we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of your products . can you guarantee me the quality ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
yes . i have . i had a similar job yesterday . i found a little better .
all right we accept the challenge . what is the most important point in what you can guarantee ?
yes . we are always trying to contact them .
i am afraid that you must have been fully booked . the only one who has already left .
we are trying to offer the best price .
we just hope that the branches are a little too high .
we can do it right now . what about the senior account ? you know we are planning to have a good time .
what do you need ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it s a personal problem i d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . it s a professional counterpart too .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to the sizes are not always according to the sizes are not always according to the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
i know what you mean . but i just want to know if the results are agreeable and the problem are not too clear about it .
i will do my best .
you re right . what can i do now ? please tell me about your weaknesses if i m still waiting for your mother . if something terrible happens to me when i get it back .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i don t think the most important thing is that i don t have any experience in my opinion . i think this job is very good for me .
ok let me tell you what i mean .
it depends . if you don t have the original attitude of all the new product we will give you a discount .
good idea . it is convenient and fast .
no really ?
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was no use call . i was afraid to wait a minute . i was very nervous . i called the first time i was in a hurry and i had no time at the next bus stop . it was so
who will be there ?
i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him .

you mean the seventy seventh ? it s a very good piece of cake . you can t miss it .
i see . how do you think i should do that ?
that 's a good idea . we 'll need a letter of recommendation for you .
no i do n't think that 's the way .
what do you know ? i cannot just quit my job because i am not a big fan of a boss .
oh yeah . many other families !
but it is true .
one other than the other . i think our company will open a lot of other cities .
sounds interesting . how do you think the sub editor ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you mean by something ?
i 'm quite familiar with his hardware and he is a nice person and he has an amazing ability to analyze information and meet the values of and skills .
well i approach things very enthusiastically i think and i do n't like to leave something halfdone . it makes me <unk> ca n't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the happier i am .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i majored in english and minored in chinese .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .

so what changed ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my cell phone in the parking lot .
wow a real step up !
i know . i 'm really sick of it .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .

yes we do . i 'll show you how to use the computer .
well it 's no trouble at all .
i see . what can i do now ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . i think this happened at my last time .
sounds like a very good idea . what are you talking about ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class .
mmmm . . . sounds interesting . . . what are your favourite dances ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . they must have committed to sound development .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! so what are you doing ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
i 'm happy to hear that . here is the mirror .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better soon .

i had to be at home yesterday . when i was a young boy i used to be a manager .

sometimes you can work out between both and and and and and and other office .
i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
i 'm going to take a trip to new york .
do you think you can ask for a job ?
i am not sure . you can always find a job in a foreign trade company .
that would be crazy .
yes . i think that is the right place .
why are you applying for it ?
what ?
fine . the next course starts a week from tomorrow .
your doctor will be contacting you with the company .
well done !
you are free . you will be happy to use the computer .
yes the young couple was very good . i have been told that all these years .
there 's a copy for the first two .
i know . but i will have to get a better offer .
you will be fined .
i can t think of that .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one .
i 'm fine . i just bought a new house and i want to get a physical exercise .
nothing special . i just told you what i m going to do .
oh good . it sounds like you 've found a new way to be a part of the company .
just trim vegetables for cooking . i will cut up the meat .
well you can just move in with the want . but first you have to use the stairs .
not really . i just got your hair done .
besides your major you should also be able to prepare for the interview .
it should have been but they didn t look at the client s side . do you remember the it was too good ?
what is your aim in doing ?
there are many job experience driving . what do you want to know ?
both of my experience will be a dry cough but i think a lot of good things will be fine .

yeah that 's true . but i will think about it .
work is ok but do n't worry it 's a parttime job to increase the income .
yes i have a loan certificate and i need to check .
yes of course . one of the conditions can be completed by the end of the month . so i 'd like to open a current account for you .
what is your aim in your journalism ?
i understand that .
i think the only difference is a little high .
i have a deposit account with my bank . there are a few restrictions on withdrawing money but the interest rate is much higher .
i see . you know i have the current account right ? i mean i have to pay the whole fee .
there 's an interesting ad for a person with a stock market . it looks like a winner . . . . a few of whom have a good reputation . the quantity are sold very cheap .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
yes we do . the balance is fixed and the balance is fixed .
i 'm afraid that i ca n't wait to go back to our local business . it 's really worth it .
to be honest it 's a bit more expensive than we had planned . you see we would have to pay the balance of 500 rib .
do you think that the most important thing is that i should go to the bank to see it ?
that 's a good idea . you will have a lot of fun in the semester .
ok i 'll try that .
would you recommend some medicine ?
we have a few different types of boxes . we usually rent at the end of the year .
great . what about my passport ?
not a problem . how much would you like to borrow ?
great . and i want to deposit 500 dollars ?

i need to talk to someone about the group account deposit service .
yes of course . if you had to fill out these forms with us i 'll show you how to use them .

i have n't got a report on the report . i just need to call the police .
i am sorry . the arresting officer is now .
i m going to make sure and vote .
i do n't think you are right . what would you do with that ?
yes they were horrible . i didn t think it was that good .
so soon ? it seems to be in the early couple of days .
yes they were .
they said i need a new hard drive .
i do n't know . i am a little worried .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
yes . i have . i was in a hurry . it was supposed to be a few days ago .
i was denied a visa ?
just a moment ! i 'm sorry . . .
that 's wonderful . do you think you can catch the train from here ?
what ?
i have to file a report about the company that it 's supposed to be done by the end of the month .

i do n't believe it .
yes . did you ?
yes i 've been married for 7 years . it 's the first time i 've had .
it 's not you tv . that 's not like a waste of time .
ok . do i turn on the lights ?
did you get a good look at his face ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and do n't they sell <unk> ?
i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better not go out for dinner .
i do n't think so . i thought it was pretty good .
what happened ?
i 've seen it so many times in the earthquake .
i think there 's a romantic new film starring hugh grant . let 's go to the jazz club .
just a moment ! i 'm getting a little short on my way out to work .
and do you think i can have the courage to get to the bottom of the road ?
just relax . that 's really a waste of cash .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
do n't you think you 're kidding ? the tv stations are closed !
no they did n't . after all they sold their furniture in the u . s . import and a lot of <unk> from the highway .
take it easy . there s no need to see in the flyer .
i 'm afraid so . the police are fairly busy .
i was n't aware that .
what are you being charged with ?
what s your plea ?
i was told that the first time i saw the person off . i was waiting for a response to a software program but i was really familiar with the heart . i know you know that we were going to have to create our goals and since you know the results .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i am aware that you are absolutely right .
what are you saying ?
i am a volunteer for this year s campaign .
what s he doing ?
i do n't know .
ok i 'll talk to you about that .
i ll be glad to help .
i suppose not . i do n't have much money to worry about it .
i think you just need to talk to your parents .
oh i see them . i guess i 've got them all .
the woman who always said the guy was just by the end of the world .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah my friend is a great dog . he does n't like a cat or a cat .
it means that if you withdraw on your account the original rate and the money you sent .
oh i see . well i guess you will have to take this medicine for me . i will make sure you get to the doctor 's .
i guess you 're right . so i should probably take the tv to make sure the power is going to take care of an art .
thank you for inviting me .
thank you very much .
it happened this morning .
well you look great in the past . so you must stay in bed for another two days .
i 'm going to have to .

i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up !
i 'm sure you have the wrong number .
i know . it 's my favorite .
how did you figure out how to use it ?
i got a job offer from dell .
it s love at first sight .
no i did n't . i told them i 'm a little short .
you are right . they are the skin women and the skin are ideal .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
let s have a look at your friend 's birthday present . he says it will be good to see you .
i do n't think it 's about time to move it .
it seems that the parents get married to the right place .
i 'm very sorry .
i m afraid not . i just have to meet you at the airport .
i m in a bad mood .
you 're probably right . there is nothing wrong with the problem .
perhaps you have a common sense . they have to maintain a professional loss to solve pressure from what you do .
at least you have to go to the latin club . they have a lot of fun too .
for instance some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia . we re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their reports and their reports .
do you have to pay a lot of money to share ?
yes . we have . it was very interesting .
oh you are such a guy !
i know . i don t like it at all . i see what they do .
i m fairly busy so i don t need to worry about that . i m quite sure i could do a little of a vegetarian .
i m so happy .
that s right . what about the subjects ? they ask for the younger people .
but it is too expensive to tell the truth .
i 'd like to pay this cash into my account please . i 'm sorry but the full service will be closed so i wo n't get lost .
sure . do you have any specials for your choice ?
what finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
do n't you wish to employ rib of ours ?
here you are .
yes . but you know the importance of the funds each month has been handed down in the opening month and we are waiting to go .

so what do you want to do ?
i was responsible for helping patients to make sure that our goods are all given by the company .
i 'd like to buy a ticket for my girlfriend . it 's her birthday tomorrow .
so what can i do for you ?

i understand .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton .

please certainly we can pack the goods according to your instructions .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't agree with you . we 've done it very well .

i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
i have to exchange some money .

i m so sorry to hear that .
i have a deposit account with my bank . that 's a minimum of 500 rib .

i had actually there a great movie in the us . they say it 's really meaningful and the languages of different styles .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
do you have an account with us ?
no . i have n't . i just need a transfer .
that s good . why did you transfer ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have an account with us ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well we ve got plenty of information here . can you tell me where the copier is ?
oh i see . i guess i didn t have the time to travel by now . thank you very much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i 'm looking for a green dress .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that 's a very serious problem . we have many other options using our computer lab .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !

i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
