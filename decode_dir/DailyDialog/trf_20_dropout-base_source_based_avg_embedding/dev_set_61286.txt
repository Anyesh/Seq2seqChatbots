i 'm sorry to hear that .
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !

ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?

how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby s breath for that ? they are equally popular now .

i 'm not sure .
that 's good . i can have a try .
she must be deaf .
oh i didn t know . but she told me she did n't say that .
no i suppose i should n't have any trouble with this .
yes sir . we are always busy with the entire country .
i love you troy .
what ? why ? i don t have enough money to buy a new car .
thank you a lot .
certainly . that would be a great help .
how about your hair ?
it 's ok .
i 've got to go .
what do you want to do ?
ok i will go into more detail .
it 's all right . please have a taste of it .
i really ca n't understand him .
let me see . . . it 's 50 .
let 's look at our menus .
i would n't mind getting one .
i know . i could not have your heart but how do you try to keep it ?
ok . here is the deposit .
thanks a lot . is there any other drinks ?
sure . we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the tshirt . would you mind opening the pages on the rack ?
about five years old .
do you think it 's easy for a chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?
how many pieces of quality ?
its will be a big surprise to you .
is that so ? but i want to get a new knowledge of business with you .
this is the menu .
it 's a good idea . but i am not a big girl . i 'd like to go and see what i had .
let 's go .
it 's a small world ! may we take a tour to the river ?
why do n't we call them ?
no that 's all right . let 's go .
great i will take them .
yes i like the design but i prefer a little bamboo ones .
i think that we should get what we want . do we need money ?
yes . show me what you have done .
i saw that a lot of fun .
thanks . now let me change the subject .
what 's the brand ?
honey we 've really enjoyed our soup .
let 's have a look .
you ? have you been working too hard for the last few days ?
now i have a couple of options . why do n't you try one ?
do n't worry . it s a big beauty .
i think you should do something too . it could be really tough .
it 's a bit difficult for me to bring home some exercise . i 'm not sure i 'll just have enough time to use the atm .
how do you want your hair cut ?
yes i hope so . i am here to help with the insurance company .
that 's true . it seems that just is a holiday for all the kids . in the worst way the trouble is that all together has been killed .
then find a place to go to the park .
sorry to hear that . can we do anything about it ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
i see . what kind of food do you like best ?
what s the letter about ?
i can solve it thanks .

about a month .
what about your brother ?
i am sorry to hear that . i 'll have to take you there sometime .
oh it s been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
i usually go to the gym every day .
that 's good . but if you do not have any questions about it please .
i saw emily yesterday evening . she was a psycho .
when did you start to work ?
i see . well do n't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . he usually gives good advice and can help you help me the right direction .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
actually i only have one single room .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
it is not so good to start with . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in a sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
usually i go to london twice a year but sometimes i go three or four times a year .
i want to get a package of cigarette .
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?
well . how long is it ?
i want to give you a gift that is really meaningful .
count me in .

you will find this kind of sweater .
that 's a great idea .
i 'm waiting . . .
i see . do you have the number of the guests ?
do you know anything about this ?
could you drop me off with the interview ?
do you think we should do something different ?
thank you . i am really hungry .
i love lamb but if you want something else just go to the kitchen .
thank you .
i do n't know . i was n't feeling well .
sure . i 'd like to . but i do n't know what kind of meat it is .
i do n't know . it 's a pity .
that 's good . you should work out a little bit too .
no thanks . i did not notice it has been dark outside . i think it is time to dinner .
i 've got my new card .
what 's the occasion ? you know i do n't like it .
i think that 's how you like it .

oh yes . i 'm still working on it .
our pleasure . i believe you can make a our ending for our good .

i see . and now we have a twoyearold boy .
yes . do you know about that ?
no i have n't . i want to spend my time here .
sure . that will help you get on the menu .
alright . what 's the price ?
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
i 'll take care of it .
but i ordered a corn on the signal .
yes they have .

i 'm terribly sorry . you were going to see our products tonight .
yes . let me get it for you .
i think you look wonderful .
well i think . i 'll buy it today .

i think i just have to tell you that the chef is very sick . would you like to order now ?
thank you .
good idea . where shall we go ?
okay i 'll need to bring some information on the list . do you have any other questions ?
do you accept checks ?
is n't that a sweet tooth ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
i think it looks like a great idea .
yes . if you want to buy something from the insurance companies that will probably be paid for .
you know i really like a single room .
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
thank you for calling . i 'll let you know when the reservation is .

ok i will think of it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
ok let 's go and ask .
our computer lab is on the first floor .
you know that i think about it . i think it 's much easier to get for working with people .
that 's great .
i think our house would be wonderful .
ok let 's go .
is that a good idea ?
ok let 's go .
why are they all the same ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
ok i 'll call it to you as soon as we get home .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if it 's true or not the subway system is the best place to take a taxi .
let me help you .
could you please help me with my bags ?
when would you like to fly ?
good thing . i hope we 'll get better .
is it far from here ?

i suppose you are right .
how would you consider your strengths ?
i did n't know that .
10 per person .
i did n't know that .
yes . there are two hilton hotels .
thank you very much .
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
i know . thanks a lot .
you re welcome .
waiter !
well i was hoping to get a letter of recommendation .
i 'd like to reserve a table for two . the window is over there .
it is 15 minutes drive .
then we 'd better get started .
i 'm sorry sir . we will arrange a table for you .
one dollar . drop it in the box . move to the rear of the bus . there are plenty of seats in the rear .
i 'm sorry . sir . could you tell me your name please ?
i can see the suspect .
oh thanks all the same .
we have two rooms available . would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?

thank you .

if you give me the <unk> menu first please .
yes . how much do you want ?
ok . i 'll have it .
yes . thank you .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
sure . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is spicy and hot .
and it 's a choice of bread to go with my chicken ?
in the beginning of the interview you should make use of the interview .
yeah . i guess it 's good to see them .
i agree . we ca n't ask him to call us any more .
i think it 's too slow .
here you are .
thank you .
yes we do .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
i 'm not sure . just show me the wine menu .
sounds good . i 'd like a hamburger please .
yes . you have to go to the zhongshan park .
do you know when it leaves ?
you should change to the no . 701 bus at the next stop .
thank you . where is the next bus leave ?
it 's only a walk to the park in the city .
whatever . you think i 'm doing a good job .
good . do you like it ?
well ca n't you make it for two only ?
how would you like it ?
can you tell me how many people are there in your party ?
i 'd like a little sugar please .

what about cocktail ?
then i 'd like the egg drop soup .
good .
i 've got whiskey and brandy but i need some beer and soda . that s all .
oh yes they are all right .
it 's good .
okay . i 'll get it . oh there 's a minute .
no just call me uncle .
the sooner the better .

no i 'm fine . i 'll have some more beer .
the large canyon is 120 .

really it s so beautiful .

ok . i will take your room . we have single rooms double rooms suites and luxury suites .
no i do n't like the way . can you show me where it is ?
yes . show me the way .
ok now some points for attention . first of all pay attention to safety . . . now sign your names on the lab record and after that you can start . if there is any question just let me know .
it does n't matter .
i think it 's going to be enough to get this done .
how about this one ? this is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one .
i think i might have a similar experience .
oh yes . take one .
have you decided on anything ?
how about the classical music club ?
how would you like it ?
medium .
this means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home like your digital tv or your computer .
ok . why do you think they are qualified for this position ?
nothing . i 'm just so sorry .
really ? that 's something i should do . i am a little worried about .
i think you should give me a discount .
i do n't know . i 've been through my birthday and i have n't decided yet .
one second problem sir . that 's the price we have offering . how about this insurance policy ?
if you think it 's too late .
great . i 'll take it .
well it s got to be 12 . 50 dollars for each .
well i 'll give you a discount if you order .
it s on sale for 80 .
that s right . no one else has informed me of that . as far as the junior executive holiday is due to some extent .
do n't mention it . good luck .
i 've got a great idea .
i 'm sorry but the price is final .
but you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies .
oh you do n't have to ? the train leaves in an hour .
congratulations ! that 's great !
i 'm here on business .
sure . there is a big lake in the resort .
it is extremely beautiful . this is the very thing i 've been dreaming of . please put in a gift box for me .
good . how would you like to pay for it ?
ok now some points for attention . first of all pay attention to safety . . . now sign your names on the lab record and after that you can start . if there is any question just let me know .
yes i know it is . but it takes a long time .
i see .
it 's 325 a month . it 's the biggest we 've got in this area .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
thanks for saying so . i should thank you for saying so .
well i think this suits you best . what do you think ?
can it wear well and keep its shape ?
it 's 325 a month . it 's the biggest we 've got in this area .
and how about i can use the channel ?
do you have tea in china ?
i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
it is extremely nice .
good . how much is it ?
i will take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
i think that is a very good resume . you must have been working as a manager .
may i have a try ?
it surely is .
ok . um . . sorry i don t think i can get them .
for the most part yes . we have a single room with bath from the red and we have n't done that for a while .
i think the blue one will do .

to be honest i think it 's very difficult to stop using gambling for human life .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
so you think i should get some food ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .

that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .

yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?

you re welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
what do you like to drink ?
i do n't know . i like your cooking so much .
oh yes . i love them and they have a good time .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m just going to let you go .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . you can do better tomorrow .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i 've been working with friends for three years .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

well i want chinese food .

wow that 's a long one . do you have the receipt ?
that s fine . i 'll take it .
but i get a pay rise of 5 and a half for all the other .
it 's too difficult to get them from the your old .
are you kidding ? the bus goes to london is too crowded .
i 'm glad we 're coming .
well . first of all it s very important for you to be punctual . interviewers usually don t think much of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
it s great . we will be in a position of dealing with the hr manager and then we will send our clients to our factory .
i think i should get a few too .
well cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . it ll probably cost around six dollars .
ok i will take it . how long have you been in this company ?
thank you very much . i 'll be there as soon as i get home .
well i can handle that . and then make sure that we have done a research before we go .
we 'll try it right away .
what s up ?
i am tired of doing that boring work .
sure . no problem . just hold the line please .
the owner apparently has a low voice loud figure .
ok . what is your aim in going into the market ?
i tried but i didn t even know if i had to .
you are so kind . they are very responsible .
no but i 'd be happy to see them before i left .
that s fantastic ! i m glad i didn t know that .
yes .
very good . please sit down here .
yes it is .
i believe some of the office romance stories are also crucial for providing materials and organic materials .
i understand . good luck !
where do you live ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me ? why do you want to join me ?
that 's nice to meet you . where are you from ?
i like traveling here on business .
oh ! i 'm sorry . i 've never seen a movie before . when do you want to come ?
yes that 's right .
it 's all right . i 'll get it back to you tomorrow .
that s stupid .
that 's the only thing i can do . i do n't know what to do .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
i 'm glad you like them .
good luck to them .
thank you .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you in a hurry ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at s department store .
what kind of work are you applying for ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
can you tell me how to do that ?
because i would n't know how to design them .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
the only thing you can do is wait for a while . i think the customer is in a bit of a short . how about this one ?
no it 's not so expensive . do you have your credit card ?
we ? do you have any other plans for tomorrow ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
so let 's get registered tomorrow .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
i haven t seen you for several days .
about seven .
no let 's go on saturday .

i did n't know you were such a baby . what 's your problem ?

yes . but we can not judge a customer who could speak it .
can i ask for a leave now ?
thanks bye .
yes he told me that i have an interview with him .
here is the ticket .
you are welcome . please press the button if you need any help .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
bye .
if only we 'd remember to close it .
i am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone darling !
i wish i 'd put it in the bank .
look ! they 've taken your fur coat too .
i am sorry i ever bought it .

i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i 've never done that before . when did you go ?
no doctor . i 'll go to sleep soon .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
that 's true . many people want to go to school but i think i might be tired .
all right . now what are you looking for ?
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
we have a beautiful quilt .
how about oil or spray ?
yes i 'd like the one with the latest fashion .

i 'm sorry . it 's too cold for me to eat .
no it 's just a small bag .
may i have your name please ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
dad it 's raining outside .
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we 've already found some similar products .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
maybe i should try it on .

what about the price of the shirts ?
what kind of soup do you like ?
oh look at the flowers over there .

no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

i have n't decided yet . can you tell me what ?
no . i 'm afraid the price is too low .
those people are quarrelling .

i guess i must have asked him .
right . that was the best one i have ever seen .
you bet . well it was a great meal .
exactly .
are we losing any money ?
oh come on ! what have you been up to ?
that 's great . but could you tell me what you want to do ?
i m a terrible child .
i could try that myself . that s very kind of you .
ok . there is a lot of news in the newspaper .
i m sorry . we ll arrange a room for you .
also tell me about the other alternatives .
i will be there in a bit of a hurry .
yes . but the view is much more expensive than the world .
where to ?
wangfujing please !
how long is it ?
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
ok how about sunday then ?
that 's fine with me . could you give me a second ?
i 'll do that .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
5 yuan please .
do i have to pay a lot of time ?
thank you .
yes here you are .
hello madam . where to ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
for a moment please .
i 'm going to go and get it now .
compared to the shortest route you may pay around 5 euro more .
here is the money .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
i am sure you will enjoy your trip .
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
is there a problem ? i can see you ve worked for your long hours .
thank you very much .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
what would you like for appetizer ?
oh good . sorry to have bothered you .
yes i 'm here to see the doctor .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
that would be great . thanks for your help .
see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
well i think you can find that . are you interested in a quiet apartment ?
sounds good . where would you like to be located ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . i 'll go .
i 'll take care of it .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time will he be back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the city .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
oh in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello todd !
wow ! what a long weekend !
i did n't know that .
very well thank you .
oh nothing much . i 've been working too hard for a while .
i 'm glad you came .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you are very welcome . please remember to be your duty in your manner . once you show the man you are applying for it .
see you soon .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since the day before yesterday .
i understand . thank you for your help .
i see . he 's a fairly good worker .
if a girl ca n't be so happy about this .
no not that much . just watch . . yes that 's the one . .
hmm . . . i think one of the stockholders who can make a final answer .
but promise me you 're not going to be late ?
yes . thank you for inviting me .
i am afraid i have n't got one . can i show you to the elevator ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
i think that it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally .
my car is rather old .
you re such a good goal !
fine ! i ll stop by your promise !
what do i do with the eyedrop and ointment ?
so you can bring your own bottle of wine ?
oh come on ! just tell me . i 'm just gonna have them .
cool !
yes . i 'm sick .
i 'm looking for a sharp dvd player .
how many in your size ?
hmm . how much is it ?
are you kidding ? how old are you ?
which university did you choose ?
sure . i 'll get you one .
do you think the same thing with me ?
how much are those ?
the fans are great here too . not like in philadelphia .
i see . i m sure you can buy an inexpensive camera .
! sentences poems habeas en !
i see . that s why it s so cool for a magazine .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
yes i think the one is too far . how about this one ?
probably we 'll have to talk .
that s right . everything is so light in here . i think you ll be fine .
i might not have told you i m going to call her this evening .
you are welcome .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! how do you want to sign up for these ?
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh ok .
no . that s all .
yes it is . . . wow it s very fine !
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i 'd like a oneinch photo for my interview .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
what does the special local community recommend ?
mmm this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
what is your aim in watching ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how long would you have to stay for the course ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
i found a job that is more important than that such as sales manager .
we will be more independently . i think we can have a nice trip .
can you tell me why you re interested in an interview ?
i know what you mean . i could never tell you people who were the same and then thrown in the pan .
ok then you can ask the coffee . i ll call you to pick them up .
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
of course . i will show you the brown one .
can you tell me about the cabins ?
there . it looks great don t you think ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
really ? maybe you should try it yourself .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
you know why ? is the train a car more expensive ?
yes . the view is spectacular . but look at this one . so the view is spectacular .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you . i ll look into it for you .
it s nice to meet you too .
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
well . thanks .
can you come in late tomorrow ?
not at all . we ll go to the airport .
i will need your background information before the meeting .
i m sorry sir there s no limit to how many children can you speak ?
that s really nice of you .
i am afraid not . i 've already told you that i m going to travel by car .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah it 's so much . i will take it .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
this is all right . would you like me to have dinner with you ?
an ordinary one .
an ordinary one ?
you can have the same price .
very good . i ll take it .
what would you like to see in the evening ?
sure . i like to get a few pictures of me from you .
one .
good . how much ?
it 's a bit tight . do you have any on a green one ?
i think you should go and see what i can do for you .
the dress is over there . it s a real bargain .
i am sorry . he 's out in a meeting now .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
wonderful . where are you going to find one ?
i think that i can see a few days ago .
i will be at the apartment today at 6
i m not sure but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i think so . what is your least ?
good where is your office ?
thank you very much .
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
how about this one ?
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you see i think that it is wonderful to see the price of this house .
i think so . let s go .
you ll find something .
let 's have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
that s all right . i can take it .
i think you can find the there at the next counter . there is the grand parade of ants in a few minutes .
a well i can see a lot of the house .
i 'll take it .
we have a dog and a dog .
perfect ! you can pick up a new place in the next door .
let s rock n roll .
in the meantime do you think it s a little expensive ?
i know . i should have come earlier .
my dissertation . i ca n't find my email somewhere .
i love the balcony . we can go for the front and enjoy the climb .
i love the paint .
ok sir . we will cancel it .
that s the aroma of coffee beans .
i am the manager . what can i do for you ?
hi this is the property manager . i am calling to confirm the date of the next interview . what are you going to do ?
where are you living now ?
i would love it . are you looking for a onebedroom apartment ?
let 's see what i can do for you .
i 'm afraid i have n't got a meet in the city .
good luck then .
i see .
that 's great . but could you tell me what you need to know ?
thank you .
we might need to bring some foldup chairs for people .
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
ok . what if you want to work a whole job ?
yes .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are the different effects of jet lag a year ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . please press the button if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . i 'm sorry jason . it 's my treat .
no thanks . i 'd like to have a shave .
ok please fill in the form first .
not too long . cut a little off behind and on both sides too .
well let s get you a shampoo that 's just right for your hair type . do you like it ?
i hope so . i 'm not really in size of this style but i 'd like to try this on .
you are the one i have been here for three years . and i am not familiar with the traveling abroad .
yes you are right . you are a normal accountant .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i like it to be very sophisticated .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
well i have a lot of clients . i ll take it back to my office .
i 'll give you a blood pressure . it 's bad .
i bet she will love them .
do you want me to give you a ticket ?
ok . i 'll start .
yes we do .
you can get a burger and some chinese food .
well i must admit that i like the deck with a simple but the other one is n't very reliable .
let 's hope it does n't get too cold .
oh but i thought you said you were working for our company .
so what do you say ?
ok let 's go .
ok i will take it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
ok let 's go and ask .
our computer lab is on the first floor .
you know that i think about it . i think it 's much easier to get for working with people .
i have no idea .
i have to get a few from our home inspection . do you have any idea how your house would be ?
ok let 's go .
is that a good idea ?
ok let 's go .
why are they all the same ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
ok i 'll call you later .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if it 's true for the world there are many hot pot in the city . besides i think it 's the most expensive .
let me help you .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer chinese food .
you like taste so much .
well yes .
well did you like the weather report ?
well i am not particular about chinese food .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
actually i have n't . but i 've never tried my new year 's vacation .
do you like some soup ?
i do n't like it . it 's a good idea .
oh i see . you know how about a place of your city ? it 's good and very cheap .
ok . let 's go and get some .
speaking of cold how about a thai food ?
of course i can help you . but you need to go to the gym and take the right .
well i have a couple of things .
do you have any ideas so far ? i already have a try . i need to buy some clothes at a bar .
oh i see . so i have to go to the supermarket by the bus ?
you can take it to the circulation desk . they can get the job ready in a month .
rin ?
you re welcome .
ok i will take a look .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
i would rather buy that .
mr . bergeron you leave us no alternative . we can not give you an discount as we agree to you .
ok . what time do you want to go ?
i want to buy some clothes for the summer .
are there any other advantages ?
yes maybe go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i know but i like the fashion show . i just want a little more .
yes of course . i will be happy to do our homework and also go to a club .
there is a lot of sites .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i understand . i guess i was paying for some of the fashion magazines and magazines like i do n't know what i mean .
i believe it 's the cheapest on the top of the year .
you look great . i am susan .
the late fee is 25 cents a day .
i think it 's a good idea . but when are they going to go ?
fine .
yes . i would like to go to new york for my christmas vacation .
sure . how do you like your money ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . i think we should also have them come back in a week .
i would like to talk to them about my son .
go and try it on .
well do n't think i can do it by myself .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
ok . i will bring them to you in an hour .
is it a shop there ?
my company will charge me for the .
i 'm afraid not sir . i 'm afraid i ca n't do that .
i will bring the letter of credit to you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you here . we 'd appreciate your help .
here you are .
thank you .
thank you . i am sorry for the trouble you 've been doing so well .
well i have to go to the store . the only thing i need is to buy some clothes .
sure go ahead .
i do n't know how to say it in english .
do i have any other choices ?
would you rather have a look at the long generation ?
i do n't have any other allergies .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
it should be good for them to some extent . but i think i will give them more time .
i 'm sure you like it . almost all of us never eat spicy food and all the things .
my friends and i are planning on having a barbecue right ?
can i have my chicken breasts ?
i will go and get it done before the end of the year .
oh yeah i guess i 've got it .
i see . it 's good for them to have them them now .
yes i like them very much .
yes i like it very much .
i know what you mean . i bought it from you last month and i want to tell you how it works !
i usually just go to bed at ten .
yeah you are right . this is a great party . anything else ?
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
most of the time i 'll just tea and make sure you like them .
come on you don t be a good turkey ! by the most important issue just for you .
yes we do . but i can only find a few words on the net .
i never eat any chocolate chips .
it 's delicious . do you like chinese food ?
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i 'm not particular about chinese food .
it 's ok . the doctor says you want to have the bad memory of the things .
that 's right .
it 's may be a bit too late . are you sure ?
sure . i 'll be ok .
well . i 'd like tea .
thank you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
sure . you can just throw a little off for the ground beef .
it 's still a good idea . maybe it 's hard to get away from your fat .
if i had a slight fever i would n't be so sure . i could n't get an opening .
sure . coffee is a good idea and is n't it a hot day ?
sir guests pay nothing to use the same bathroom .
fine ! i 'll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . are you sure you could try that ?
do n't be so frightened . it 's just a skill .
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it ll be a good idea to cook them at a formal dinner .
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
sure . what are you planning to do ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
okay i 'll make dinner tonight .
i know but i 'm really hungry .
what are you going to cook ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that will be ok .
okay i 'll pick you up at 600 .
i have tried it but it 's a bit chilly .
ok i 'd love to .
do n't go too much trouble .
did you go swimming too ?
can we go to a private school ?
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
how about a nice medium pepsi ?
ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
what shall i do ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
what about the drink ?
i 'm going to have to get a beer .
can you give me some water for me ?
i am going to put you in a filling form .
i do n't know what to order .
oh is that the only place you want to eat ?
i love apple pie .
what would you like for appetizer ?
i like one with flowers on sale .
what kind of sport do you like ?
what kind of clothes do you like ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
for now i want you to have them made for your decision .
what kind of games do you like ?
come on . you have all kinds of sports .
oh i ll be back with you .
no thanks . we can just serve something to drink .
how amazing !

have you got any kind of soda ?
no thanks .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .

so how about an aperitif ?
so i do n't want to go to the bathroom .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
no i 'm not sure .

well i prefer the fish .
yes . i 'd love apple pie too .
what kind of games do you like ?
that sounds like a plan .
i do n't have the slightest clue .
well it 's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works !
yeah you are right . this is very an excellent opportunity . anything else ?
yes you are right ! feel serious ! you ll be nuts !
i would like to have a hamburger .
which kind do you want to get ?
yeah you are right . this is very an excellent opportunity . anything else ?
you are so kind ! i ll take this one .

do you have any idea how many you 'd like ?
really ? i like it .
i 'd like to have a hamburger .
which kind do you want ?
yes you are right . but i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
thank you . this is delicious !
i 'll pick you up at 600 .

yes i ll have the texas chili burger .
alright ma 'am .
why do n't you try the chef 's salad special ?
i 'm really sorry . i 'll ask the manager to come over and make sure he gets the message .
will it be ok to have our own hotel room ?
yes . i 'd like to try some deep fried food .
will that work ?
that sounds good .
you want to be serious ? you always blow into some caffeine pills and start feeling <unk> .
i do n't think so . i 've got one there .
ok . i 'll take it .
i am not sure whether we can order a mixed drinks by the restaurant or we will have some delicious dishes .
yes . we can put some in the cupboard .
i 'm glad i was not sure i would like to try some of my new food .
i 'm not sure if we could find a vegetarian restaurant near the chinese restaurant .

i want to make sure that your prices are good .

i ll be glad to do it .
i think you can fix it .

yes it s creating on the walls .
what kind of feeling is it ?
i will need someone to fix it right now .

i wrote the check out for too much .
i don t think that the best way to figure out what the kitchen is .
i heard that you moved to florida .

i 'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .

no we are n't . get a cab .
you do n't think you can do anything else ?
well do n't you know for sure ?
which bus do you want to take ?
if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
yes it does . the grand canyon is truly masterpiece . no man could ever make anything like this .
we 're leaving so soon . the boss came in and they 're almost ready to go .
which bus should we take ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem . we 'll just have this all wrapped up for you .
i 've been on a bus for nearly two weeks .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no by train . i think it 's much safer than bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
now i remember . we met at a conference in tokyo last year .
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
that will be cash .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
where do we get at the cafeteria ?
oh let 's go .
you can always make a sandwich .
i think it 's a cab .
how much do you have ?
i 'm not sure but i think i did n't know that many people who went there .
actually you have to wait for the next bus .
yes i mean it .
i 've been missing your makes a change .
which bus should i take then ?
hi ann . i m calling to see you tomorrow evening .
i 'm the city in new york .
that 's wonderful .
i 'm not sure what you mean .
do you have an ipod ?
i won a prize for best local history .
do they do a good job on the food ?
you are right .
will you be <unk> ?
i 'm afraid i do n't know that .
here is your boarding pass . thank you very much .
well i 'm glad i 've got it .
i 'm sick . i have been stuck in the traffic jam for a long time .
i hope not . good luck !
well i do n't think we have any time to waste .
really ? that 's terrible .
really ? oh that 's terrible . what do you think about it ?
ok i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
she must be deaf .
i know this is awkward . . . who do you think you 're taking a walk ?
ask away .
yes .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what kind of soup would you like ?
can you tell me more about it ?
you re welcome .
my motherinlaw just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight .
how many hours of the behindthewheel course do i need to take ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
but i . . . .
i was talking to you about a year ago .
i agree with you but i think he may do not have any problem .
i think i want to try a new style .
why did n't he say that ?
i have been studying english since i was a language .
i understand . why did you put it off ?
i 've thought about it but i 'm going to travel very to canada .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
i will be leaving on tuesday next month .
oh it 's hard to say .
how long have you been to the olympic stadium for a long time ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
one of the buildings is over crowded . i think you can make it a lot more comfortable .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a new job ! so are you ready for a new one ?
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
can you recommend some kind of yogurt with old style ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i am very grateful for your help .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
i know but you ? i am not so good at it .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
i see . maybe i can buy some from the butchers and take a picture of the recipes .
what kind of class do you think should we have ?
i 'm fine . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm still living in england .
to be honest i 'm a little worried about the invite invite .
are you interested in seeing the rooms with travel ?
let 's see you then .
by the way what 's the date today ?
i 'm afraid i have to go now . i 'll call you back if you 're in 3 days .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
thanks but i 'm not very good at it .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i hope you 're right . i 'll try my best to do the job well .

i 'm going to take a driver 's course . how about you ?
and what about your spanish ?
i see . well what 's the problem ? maybe you need to take a vacation .
i see . do you have any questions for your financial position ?
it does n't matter .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
so did i .
you see . i 've already decided that i 'm going to attend my new job .
i see . what 's your date of birth ?
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
now let me have a look at you . you 're lucky !
but it is n't .
anything else sir ?
yes i did . did you ?
it 's rather high . it 's rather serious .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
oh i did ?
i know you did n't have any more energy .
it 's not the only reason i want to know .
i start a parttime job as a bartender .
it 'll be soon for you to drive a light then .
let me see . did you guys go on a date already ?
it was n't as good as i would have liked .
that is to say you enjoyed your stay .
i do n't know . i did n't mean to hold a cold .
of course i can help you . did you guys go with your new balance ?
i think i caught a cold .
so how do you think about it ?
thank you very much .

i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what about you ?
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
i agree .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
here . shall i help you ?
oh right . you re holding a heart . what 's your hurry anyway ?
yes it is .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about the problem ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to study english literature .
i understand .
that s a good idea . i m sure you ll do well . we need people to work hard .
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances .
that s good . i want to watch the football game .
it seems that people can never speak english more about it .
what about the iguana ?
so what do you think of the house that you are going to have to pay online ?
i think you re right . i think that there is more important than a person than a human resources manager . i think it s appropriate for me to be a millionaire and i hope to get a new career in the west coast .
he is really a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
very well . thank you .
how was it ?
i want to get a package of cigarette .
what 's the problem ?
i need to use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t think of that .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
i believe they are a local delicacy in the south .
and my wife would be happy if i bought her a mink coat .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! millions of gigantic stones . . each one perfect . .
o . k . if you think about it please feel easier to know how you feel about your family ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
got it . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
i m not exaggerating at all . i m just for being an easy conversation .
so i can buy any hobbies .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other countries .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to get a package of cigarette .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
all right . now you can take your case away .
i never did this today .
yes quite sure .
you honestly have no idea ?
i 'll buy it for 2000 .
what s the problem ?
what s the problem ?
thanks a lot .
i 'm sorry . the doctor has gone to four . i 'll be there soon .
i would like to use a computer .

i think that i can get there .
yes i 'm thinking about taking one of those classes .
will you be paying some of that off today ?
what kind of medicine would you like ?
i could come in tomorrow afternoon .
i 'm going to see a doctor . i 'll see you tomorrow .

you should do it yourself .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here 's a twenty . keep the change .
please fill in this form .
i 'm afraid i do n't know the story .
that s horrible . if you think about the situation you should make a happy choice .
no i think it should be the least .
of course . i think so . but the feeling of the paper is too big .
sure what else can i do for you ?
maybe makeup would be enough ?
i am not sure where the bookstore is .
good . now the other one is right over there .
sure . just write down your name and library card .
well it 's not as easy as he got .
yes . especially with the dry season of this package has been very hot .
i would like to purchase it .
of course you are are not serious .
i think it 's too far .
could i have a look at your passport please ?
no . not at all . for your reference i would rather have the forgotten of it .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
i do n't know what to tell you .
they look all right to me .
the end of the year you see will have a series of seven days .
look at this one . it 's very heavy .
by the way what 's the time now ?
but thank you very much all the same .
wow ! i thought you were going to be kidding me about what ?
i have been a similar job for the last 6 years . have you been with this scholarship ?
the minimum amount of exercise we can use depends on how many weight .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i used to be a big difference not only but now i know when she 's at school .
these are excellent . i can only keep the books for the week .
we 'll have fruit salad to start and then the roast beef .
i 'm sorry ms . jenkins .
if we do n't get much time off we 'll have a good time .
i have been at the beginning of class for 6 months and i 'm still a student .
so you want me to be there ?
no it 's a slow time .
thank you .
we 'll do well in detail .
i know . it 's easier for them to get the host family for me .
we 'll have whatever you want .
i 'm sorry ms . jenkins . she must have told you i left for a few minutes .
shut up . you should think how to make not look for a <unk> .
i 'm glad to help . which position did you want to study ?
the most important thing is that i can do in this company .
have you taken any walk ?
but i 'm not a customer .
why ? you make a perfect choice .
i don t think it over much . there are always some subjects that are usually people .
i think the most difficult thing is being able to handle them as long as you can .
i know . do n't worry about it .
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
i have a problem .
what s the problem ?
oh yeah . here you go .
what kind of sandwich did you want ?
yes i d like to do that .
i appreciate it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
there you go .
what ?
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
i did n't know that . but i think i 've got a cold .
that s ok .
because i want to know how to improve myself .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think so .
i can t imagine that .
sometimes he is just not reasonable .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
all right . i hope you can do a good job .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i 've also got a promotion at work earlier this month .
i think it 's the most wonderful game i have ever seen .
i agree with you . but i think we can t handle it .
come on ! a little labor much health .
i m same with you !
oh yeah . um . . i ll ask my doctor to come and take care of how things going out for you . maybe i can figure it out how much to the bookstore .
yes .
thanks a lot . you re a real friend .
well you have to wait your back . i m sure you ll be here a little later .
so what s the problem ?
have you made a reservation ?
that s true . but i think education is harder than most .
because he stayed with me all the time that night .
maybe they are shorthanded in the kitchen tonight .
so cool . then what 's next ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i thought he only liked to go for his dinner .
chill out ! what 's wrong with you ?
what is it ?
he took the money and tried to get away .
that 's okay . i 'll take it .
i think so . what 's wrong ?
so how do you like the foxtrot ?
you did n't see the red light ?
how did you know that ?
as you know it 's located in china . the western part of my life is a big city .
it 's too bad .
exactly it does .
the blue one ?
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
that s very nice of you to say so . i should say you are glamorous yourself as a matter of fact .
i 'll take a dozen .
of course i know .
do you have a fever ?
can she call her later ?
of course not .
i do n't think i am in a hurry . i just ca n't fall asleep .
where should we go eat today ?
i think we 'll get together soon .
let 's sing it together .
have n't you heard ? she 's very forgetful .
hi linda i 'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
she 's a friend of amy . we met at amy 's birthday party .
yes what 's the matter ?
i like her idea .
oh shut up roy .
i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy that she 's doing okay .
i had no idea but i didn t think about it . i think that s a good idea to get a good idea .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the 1e kids .
yes .
oh she did n't appear .
i 'll get it .
oh she did n't say that .
can you tell me what you want to do ?
if your son starts to buy video tapes he ca n't keep them very long .
you 're right . we 'll catch the cake .
what would you like to see in the kitchen ?
what happened ?
take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
sure . i 'm really sorry .
no i do n't think so . i 've had a bad time and i 'm in a hurry .
no . not really . i am just going to give you a definite answer . it will be great .
oh i 'm afraid i did n't have it .
what an shame ! how many people get hurt ?
how did you know that ?
i got it . i need to get my food from the states . but i need to buy some medicine for my friend .
who is your favorite hip hop artist ?
i 'm not imagining it . finally i got home to work . he was just standing there . he had to go to the hospital and did n't smile .
well it was about a mouse and got a mouse running away from the street . he s got a wet patch on our clothes !
oh that 's too bad . but it 's most kind of you .
ok i have it .
i 'm not sure . i do n't think i 'll be a better team .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her .
which one ?
i think we should have more roads built .
my mother died two years ago .
i did n't know that would be so happy .
i 'm so sorry i did n't think of that .
oh my god . those two people are over there .
yes i did . the purpose of this unit is mostly good .
sounds so complicated ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
they must be just happy you are .
sounds good . i 'll go back to you in the promise !
i can tell you at the glance that your prices are much too high .
i plan to arrive on august fifth and leave on august eighth .
yes . we should have been here for almost half an hour .
yes i watched the first trip on the first bus of march .
oh i 'm afraid i was n't .
i think you 're a b .
not really . i have to go there by bus every day .
now sir do you have a credit card ?
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
yes but we should have come here again sometime .
how much do you want to spend ?
no . i 'd like to go straight the street .
i 'm sorry i have no idea . let 's go .
i really appreciate the way . how much is it to send me by next week ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes . do you want to go ?
thanks for telling me so much .
what was that you just said ? you didn t see the ones that you saw . . .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
i will ! i could use some good luck !
ok . can you tell me how to operate the treadmill or the skipping rope ?
i didn t get accepted .
what does it say about the balance ?
i do n't think so . let me buy a new one .
that 's really good . can you show me the receipt ?
i 'll give you some medicine and you can take it back when you want to a new student .
the video is killing time and on the second floor .
yeah i was . i 'm going to take my word and i want to be a lot better .
not really . it is very kind of you .
the style is all right .
yes go make it for two .
i 'm glad to tell you that you have come to .
good morning . what time is it now ?
i think i will start my new job and try my best to become more professional .

that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
you ll be able to easily find something comfortable in that price .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
what do you think ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
four and a half going on twelve !
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i 've been working with friends for three years .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds like a good idea . i always love going bar beyond my friends and i 'm in the mood to play soccer games .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
i will check the availability . sorry to interrupt but i have to check the time .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
that s ok . i m so sorry .
i had to watch a football game last night .
do you think i believe the story like that ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i want to get a package of cigarette .
no problem . i 'm really looking forward to seeing you again .
i won t be able to give you back your deposit .
do you have an airsickness ?
no that 's it .
how would you like your steak done ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
well we 'll make it this way . and here is the bigger and better . please try it on .
oh . i just checked the house and you 're right .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let us know .
sure . do you have any specials today ?
how much would you like to withdraw ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
coffee please .
i love you home here .
yes here you are .
thank you .
not today . do you have a credit card ?
you can exchange some us dollars at the exchange rate of the day you want .
oh it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
then my son drove into a tree
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hello . i want to speak to your director of human resources .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
can you tell me what the problem is ?
i really hate being with you .
you know i could have left it in the mail . i know i ll be sorry i have to go now .
oh i 'm glad . hey do you know if the taste of this restaurant is busy ?
does it close at six ?
here 's the list . you just need to take a look at this plate . do you want to see it ?
oh i see ! no wonder you are going to be so happy with that !
well i m just wondering if you like to go to the party and prepare for yourself .
how much would you like it to be then ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why not ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long does it take to deliver the goods ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
just one of my head hurts .
i was late getting back to work early .
oh that s great . what s the problem ?
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
i hope you enjoy it .
can you put all your hand where it is ?
you think ?
yes . good for you .
if you re a girl that s what you like to see at all .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you . i m glad to finally meet you .
great ! that was a great shot .
excuse me miss . what 's the tour time we have ?
oh good .
oh shut up !
it 's still early .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate your analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's great ! will you take your picture with the the window ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i hope you 're not turning into a sissy on me dave .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
whoa ! so many things are not possible to take off the fat deposit ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
yeah . it s really a nice game .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
don t worry about it . i ll show you how to solve your behavior .
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how about all these ?
me too . i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
what is your greatest weakness ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
it s a good thing that i ve ever heard .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i am sorry but you can t make it .
i am not laughing at you .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think we should get the nerve to do this .
anyway i think it s a good idea to put a red shirt on you . but i m not sure i can use it on the market .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . i know you want some of your friends . but we should be friends .
are you more interested in a position or fulltime or parttime position ?
what are you talking about ? what are we talking about ? i just ca n't go wrong with my boyfriend .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear . ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
what kind of magazine does it have ?
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
i m not kidding . i just eat less and exercise more . that way i m exhausted !
dad ! i don t want you to eat me here !
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of money ?
ok i ll just take a look at what i m doing .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well .
what 's the problem ?
i need souvenirs !
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . but if it 's a piece of cake i will go out to the office and get it at once .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you think you are a good candidate for your present job ?
i did n't get the position you wanted .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yes . i have n't heard of it .

i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
alright . you were meant to be your mother did n't you ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
cool . can you hold it for a second ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
milk ? i think you 're right .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
i 'm open to a restaurant tonight .
why not ?
who started the modern girl ?
no the weather is too cold . let 's walk .
i really do n't like this weather .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem . i have some bad news .

i 'll give him a nose .
here you are .
good . how about you ?
sure . that 's really a good idea .
thank you .
thank you .
you re welcome .
thank you . it 's a good idea .
yes .
after being raised together men and women can be businesslike in each other s company . it really doesn t have anything to do with the way a company has just to show his or her because of the way .
it is very quiet and peaceful .
the street is n't wet .
i think it s so nice of you .
these pictures look wonderful . they look amazing . i 'll show them one .
yes i did . my family and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . how about you ?
i lost ?
i 'm from work .
i think i could have a look at her .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily .
he 's got a promotion .
oh that 's too bad . may i ask what you 've done ?
no joke !
i believe they are a very important thing for me . i will take care of them .
you will be a very promising one .
oh that s the ones that are the ones that i know .
i 'm not so sure of that . i think it 's good for them to push sales .
why do n't you try this other tshirt ? i think you can look nice in both of them .
you don t like them ?
uh . . . i 'm just a little short .
oh i was n't too impressed .
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
i advise you to stay at home .
i know you must be a big fan of skiing .
is it really interesting ?
i hope you enjoyed your dinner .
this color is becoming more and more popular .
the early bird gets the worm .
i would n't think about it .
i can do it for you .
we pitched a tent in the night waiting for the sunrise . wow ! it was too beautiful .
me too . do you want to come by and watch the news at my place ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes i see . here it is . you are <unk> by the way .
yes .

there is a open place right now .
oh there were a lot of of of people . i do n't know what to do .
and what about the work ?
it was a pleasure . it was really a kind of you .
yes it 's hard to say .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i studied french and german .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's a distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i think he may be a bit crumpled .
oh i thought it was a red dress . hmm you 're lucky .
let me see . oh we have a basketball class tomorrow .
margaret mitchell .
i 'm finished .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
you 're under arrest for that . if you want to go to the movies you have to go to the movies .
she 's a fairly good professional . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what about his daughter ?
do you like it ? i think it 's sheer waste of time to work with people .
so what experience do you have ?
i 'm afraid not . i 'll ask mr . smith to call you back .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
the same to you !
i will send them to my friends to pick them up in next week .
i did n't know that .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .

yes she is .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
what 's her personality ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
so want me to finish my report ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
no i 'm just asking .
unbelievable . i heard that she was very interested in fashion .
what are you doing there on the computer ?
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i m afraid you re pretty sure about the stuff .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like the best . can i try ?
so you do n't have to worry about them .
first you have to make a statement . if you want to withdraw your money before you can use your deposit back on your rent payment we give you a refund .
so what are you doing to lose ?
i m sorry . it 's our policy .
can you tell me more about the safety of your home ?
if you do n't know the quality of the consignment is unacceptable . we assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care .
really ?
really ? i want to be a great candidate .
six .
i think the accountant of the only child who made the reservation .
no i think harry will get it .
it seems that some people are getting sick .
really ? but that is not the only thing .
yes . it does .
i could n't agree with you more .
let me see . there are many colors to feed on hot dogs and vegetables . take a look at the colors .
no he has n't .
that 's true . but we think they 're all pretty tough . and i think they 'd be happy to give you the brand is not easy .
it s true .
i guess so . maybe he is going to have a vcr to get in the house .
yeah some friends of the scenes were good much fit for me .
i agree but it is an important experience to protect your intellectual and mental harmony and behavior .
yeah you find it difficult to breathe in the trash .
is there anything else you have in mind ?
she 's my grandma .
i see . does he have a vcr now ?
she 's a great girl . she has a great sense of humor . she 's very feminine . . .
no one . i think it 's how you know that 's a suitable person .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i will .
hello is that stefan ?
hello is that stefan ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
is this your first year in college ?
ping .
where ?
i 'm from new york .
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
to get the ball rolling belt ?
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t think i did that .
a large set of two blocks ahead .
yes our team took us all the time .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
i 'll give you a call later .
just watching some tv .
i 'm having a party this friday .
it 's really something .
he did n't do that .
yes . he has a moustache but he 's a very nice guy .
when will he be back ?
okay . give me a ring .
really ? what did he do ?
see you soon .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .

yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .

yes . what is up ?
we 'd like to talk about the safety of our company .
how about some korean food ? there 's a place right there on the corner .
hello i am not particular about the food .

i think you need to buy a lot of new shoes .
good luck .
thank you .
i plan on going back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
yes what do you have in the mood for ?
oh i did n't want to . it was a good game .
i understand . why did you leave your last job ?
yes i liked it too . was it really the most awful evening ?
you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you but people will respect the fact that you have the right to be very happy .
hello todd !
wow ! what a long weekend !
i did n't know that .
very well thank you .
oh nothing much . i 've been working too hard for a while .
i 'm glad you came .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .

no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
since the day before yesterday .
i understand . thank you for your help .
i see . he 's a fairly good worker .
if a girl ca n't be so happy about this .
no not that much . just watch . . yes that 's the one . .
hmm . . . i think one of the stockholders who can make a final answer .
but promise me you 're not going to be late ?
yes . thank you for inviting me .
i am afraid i have n't got one . can i show you to the elevator ?
i like to listen to the movies .
i do n't know . i like it very much .
what ?
i like to see some traditional chinese arts and crafts .
yeah i like the meaning of making her own stuff . they are supposed to make sure you buy the same thing .
i guess you can t have it both .
to be honest i think we have the same musical tastes .
by the way can you tell me what the date it is today and what day it is please ?
sure . we can watch the football match the same plate as the window .
oh we were in the same science class last term .
i think you should have confidence in yourself .
we hit a couple of local bars and met up with some friends . everything was cool until mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !
yes he was a failure .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
did n't they hurt you ?
she said she would be here in charge of the reception office .
really ? i m so happy for you .
it 's a shame !
oh . i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
did he leave when you left ?
sure thing .
so for now you want me to give you a ride .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i do n't think so . he was better than the othersi really liked it .
yes . i have heard about that .
well i 'm not really in the mood for work but i had a lot of bad changes in my city .
i am a great idea !
that 's too bad . but i heard it 's a chinese restaurant . would you like to try one of your favorite ?
yes it 's very convenient .
how much ?
it 's really good . you have to go into the course .
i 'm a tourist . this place is really exciting .
i 'll take care of it .
no i did n't think but i met her last night and i told her i 'd be quite surprised if i hadn t moved to her .
i had to fight the damage to the air .
and just one more question would you like to be an interpreter ?
yes i 'm quite an .
i think it was the top of the bread .
i think that he had a kind of character sense of humor .
he was very easy and easygoing .
it certainly is ! so are you going to have a good time here ?
delighted i was able to help .
it is so kind of you to help me .
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .

why is that ?
can you recommend some of the chinese traditional festivals ?
yes . i am the foreign trade department .
it 's for fun . i will have a new year 's resolution .
why not ? the sweetheart pendant matches the shirt . i d suggest you buy a pair of perfume .
ok . it 's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before it will do you harm .
that 's great . it 's a good idea .
the stone is a log . it was turned to stone millions of years ago .
yes . take it easy . i seldom play games with films .
it 's a yellow one .
all right . let s see you tomorrow .
the party starts at 8 o 'clock .
no . i 'm not . i 'm really sorry .
i 'm so hungry .
now .
does it look like a huge house ?
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
good . i 'm sure you 'll love it .
oh thank you . this is your first interest .
i m glad you like it . it 's a bit too small for me . can you give me a different price ?
i hope so . thank you .
i see .
yes of course . it 's actually the tradition of the festival .
it 's a good idea . and i am very happy for the kids .
i guess so . i am really behind the posters .
i see . the common practice is for all chinese people . and some people do n't like to hand out the new year .
most people are from school . how about you ?
wow !
yes i agree . with all the colleagues we should do something about it .
my favorite is to play computer games . of course it is the most delicious local time to play .
i will be paying you for it .
well hurry up and open the door please . i told you these things are heavy .
i have good news for you . you can get me there .
let 's go .
i do n't know . i want to lose this place .
the tv station is next to the basement .
why ? it 's so easy !
i mean it s not his fault .
such as chess is the best way to avoid a product . while it is convenient and secure career .
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
take it easy . we can exchange it for a new one .
at 11 o 'clock .
the red one has a very good taste . but i think they have a very good career .
how long would you like to stay with the company ?
i 'm sure he will . we 're very glad for all of you .
i 'll give you the number .
thank you .
well the price for the apartments are near the end of the month .
the price per copy is ten cents .
can you tell me the key qualities ?
yes .
not really . that 's the best we can do .
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what happened ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how many papers are there in the states ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
now that i should know what i am talking about .
have you heard the news about our company ?
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
the next game i will definitely be there .
actually i do n't know you were only one when the reason is that i was younger .
we will refund the charge as soon as we can .
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i m afraid i m late . i really need to go .
i will .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
do you have any plans ?
yes i think i 'd like the fish .
do n't worry i can eat any meat but i do n't want the fish .
actually you have n't have much .
milk please .
that 's terrible . do you think we should get together ?
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do that .
i used to be in a good site . i think it 's too expensive for kids to get more .
no . i 'd like to do that . what does the charge me ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i thought you were going to get married in a year .
no i was n't . i 'm still a little worried about my host home .
great ! you must be very proud of yourself .
yeah i worked in a department store .
do you feel comfortable with the job ?
well you ll be late . it was nice talking to you .
over there .
do n't worry . these dates are really nice .
i think the most important thing is that you need to get more sleep .
no please feel free .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
oh right . let 's see . . . how about some ?
please do n't be so sour . i 'm sure you will like it .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's not easy to say . i like the novels of waltz .
do n't be such a chicken ! i 'm afraid i ca n't .
oh yes let 's go into the dancehall and ask if we can take .
that 's something i could never do .
well that s why i think they are so important !
yes . in fact the ancient olympics has become an exhibition of greek to chinese history . so i will see you at the christmas history of china .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . in order to prevent the fish from being set off with only 2 and the complete amount of <unk> savor the wine .
that 's good . i think the most important thing is you should be happy about your work experience .
let 's see . i think it 's a little too small .
you can rest assured of that .
it 's fantastic .
yeah . i love it too .
well how about like this ?
that 's a good idea . this is a nice place to go .
sure i like the music on the stage . it 's a good idea .
thank you for the dance .
then you must be interested in classical music .
yes i 'd love to .
do you play much tennis ?
sorry i do n't .
oh a dance class ! i love music .
yes i like it very much .
what about your performance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i will need to see your id and 27 .
i know they have been concerned about the performance lately .
i didn t get accepted .
why ? i think you 're right . maybe we can give a hand to dance .
no . i like to make a fuss . it 's the most exciting one you have .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old and he lifts weights every day .
do you know how to spell your love ?
let 's order a while for dinner .
i like playing the piano . i 'm so sorry .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
then tell me about it . what do you think about the time ?
no but there is no limit to the price .
oh no . i do n't know what to tell you . this is a terrible headache .
i do n't think so . i 'll make myself a too much on the way .
what kind of clothes do you like ?
yes it 's not like cold in winter .
i hope that you had good journey .
that s a good idea .
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
it 's mild . but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what about the weather ?
i like spring .
may i take it with me ?
i am not surprised to hear you say so . but i really love the peace .
i really like the winter .
yes a little breeze and a lovely moon .
oh i like the winter too . can you make it for me ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i will be there in a few minutes .
yes . that is what i feel like having .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i like winter . but it 's scary .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
wonderful ! i have a lot of free time here .
yeah some places are very short of water .
let 's wash the vegetables and have a nice day .
yes the weather is so warm .
yes .
and how was your favorite ?
oh i forgot about it .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
no problem at all . go ask the policeman over there .
i m sorry .
i appreciate you saying that . so what do you think we should do ?
do you think you can tell me something about your family ?
yes what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
next week .
what 's the damage to the apartment ?
that s good . see you then .
yes . i have no plans .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's rush hour .
i 'd love to .
go to the window and find the circuit box .
oh do you have a club card ?
this afternoon .
yes . that s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
thank you for coming .
yes it is .
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i think they will be used as a safety inspection system . once they arrive in scotland they will have enough time to go anywhere in the city .
i ca n't log on the internet again .
how about this one ? this is 500 yuan .
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
i do n't care . i 'm sure the power will be worth it .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
i know . i ll get on it now .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
is he getting better now ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
did you do anything else ?
you re welcome .
mary i am so sorry i wo n't .
he is good at work . he gives me a bad cold and enjoys working with new friends .
does he have good records ?
yes he does .
if you could him i would appreciate it .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
it 's a real thing we 've done is in a short time . is it true that there is something wrong with your skirt ?
then i 'll try to shake it on .
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to go home with my family and i do n't have to go to the gym .
sorry i 'm afraid we have no photo in this whole week .
this is a good party . i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
oh i 'm afraid i do n't have any time to have lunch at 8 00 .
that 's what i thought .
they re no all played on the election .
that 's a big family .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
hi mr . emory . i was just having a meeting with dr . thomas .
it 's my pleasure .
i really wanted to see the famous places of interest in this city .
goodbye . hope to see you again soon .
i appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
you are welcome . come back again .
that would be pretty good .
but i just want to give her some tips .
yes . . .
that s really surprising .
you can have used car before . you can listen to your sale of the machine .
of course i 'd love to .
oh good . may i ask whether you will like it ?
i know that but it 's hard to say . she has to like big ideas .
it 's easy . if you want to get the job done you should get more sleep .
i think it 's time for you to get the job done .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . the problem is that it 's really hard to get lost .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and he 's so handsome .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i m still learning about them .
yes it s hard . don t worry . you re actually doing it .
yes . why not ?
yes it 's not only the coffee shop . it 's in the corner with your wife 's complexion .
how can you tell me about this ?
ah yes .
i am not familiar with the design .
well it 's a little bit difficult . the air is fresher and it 's on the heavy side .
very interesting . so it seems you have to be your most popular ?
yes . but we can not judge a customer who could speak it .
the bigger they are the harder you think .
and it 's perfect .
you should attend school to improve your english .
i think you should go to the interview class this morning and have a rest .
first i heard that the fax machine is connected by using the information .
let 's stay at the restaurant and have a look at the menu . i 'm not sure if we could go for the theater in a while .
sure what do you mean ?
yes you are right .
i 'm afraid i do n't know the story .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
oh . i know . but you must still have a good time .
no . the hills ?
not really . i just bought it .
they were all so modest . they 're both very chinese and the speak of english .
i know but mom i 'm not dirty .
that 's the point . the red and has been either the double <unk> .
oh gosh ! i did n't know that . i have to go to the bathroom to the restroom !
i do n't know . they 're the most experienced member of the national team .
i see . yes mr . emory can t be involved with that . would you please fill out the application form ?
i don t think this enough .
oh . i 'm sorry but i 've already been away on my way out now . i 've already got your time .
yeah . we can have a nice weekend .
the last beginning class starts on october 25th .
does it actually help you to improve your english ?
then my son drove into a tree
thank you very much .
do you think i could borrow the car ? i m going to concert tonight .
alright . i think we should go .
she 's in the states .
really ? it 's interesting .
i think about ten years .

she lives in the city .
no i just went to bed last night .
ok . i 'll tell you what we 're here .
yes i have one of your children now .

she is still in a coma .
it s very kind of you .
oh i 'm so sorry .
it s ok .
i was n't feeling too well .

he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .

she is a very nice girl .
no i 'm free . i have to have a date with you .
i see . would you like me to give you a lift ?
and do n't forget to buy your suit .
but that is true . four people have been married for 7 years and you just have to get married .
don t worry . she is fine .
yeah .
i m sure i ll meet a little later .
yes i have a house in new york .
did you have a breakin ?
i was n't there when i was a child .
oh i see . but his wife found out he has a job on the internet . she is interested in creative yet .
i see . where are you going ?
yes i 'd like to .
yeah . but how can you tell me what your secret is ?
all right . i ll be right back .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
does n't sound like he ?
yeah . it 's really painful .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
not really . i thought it was disappointing .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 .
why did n't we go ?
she wants to be a manager .
forget about it .
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i have n't finished it .
we can do that . what 's your favorite computer ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
the singing group used to be very popular .
what kinds of questions do you like to work them ?
well he 's got dark hair and brown eyes .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
i 'd love to . but i have to go now .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 've already got one for my vacation .
i 'll make sure and come back in a little while .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i m going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
oh you are not a child . i just heard you were a good cook for her .
it 's a long way to go . i think you 'll have to take a taxi .
well we have chocolate mousse cake and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
wonderful ! let 's call it a day .
yes i did . but as you know the title of the university is played with a foreign language .
that 's great .
i was hoping to go out with me .
i suggest you go and look at the menu .
i will be there in a comfortable place .
yes sir . we have a full service gas station .
it 's my fault . if you want to go to a restaurant you can just go to the gym .
you have a crush on your feet !
and this would be a great addition to all the qualities do you have ?
yes she 's the tour guide .
i 'm glad you came to meet me .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
oh i am sorry i 'll be busy .
i 'll be there in a minute .
our company is very quiet and peaceful .
sure i live on nanjing road near the university .
sure i will . do you have anything to declare ?
i 'll do that . when did you hear the phone ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i think the food is too cold for me .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have stopped watching a lot of television but i did n't know what to do .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why is that ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
hi lily this is tom . i 'm really happy with the job you wanted .
yes . i love it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
may i know your occupation ?
well thank you very much .
would you like to have a drink ?
come on . we can go to the hotel . we can have lunch outside .
there 's a large wooden crate in the corner .
you too .
i have been to you for a long time .
i think it has been two months since we were married .
yes i remember now .
i have been a trust system that has been a very good time .
which university did you graduate from ?
i major in japanese .
but sir the basic rule of birth certificate will be determined by your specific and behavior .
so you think you 're right .
yeah i 've been out of town .
you are always so kind .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
it 's very kind of you .
just fine and you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh there is n't ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i do n't think so . i like it very much .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes . it 's very nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i have found them .
well i m sure they re really a nurse .
whatever . just make sure they re all the same .
she 's pretty conservative .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get married ?
tom that lucky guy .
he is fine . he retired last week . it s turning going in his life .
it must be hard to say .
could n't be better .
i know . i m just glad he will be here .
he has a fever .
does he have to work with anyone ?
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know that . he always has to give us a good neighbour .
yes he does . can you tell me what he 's done ?
there is a officer that you ran a red light .
you can find out why you want to come to see the girl s favorite .
it is incredible . well the she is pretty but i think that means she is n't too happy with our work .
yeah especially since she got a promotion recently .
now she was talking with her boyfriend .
i would n't do it if i were you .
well why not ?
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
oh you are so careless . thank you .
i had a headache this morning .
not too bad .
i m afraid you are acting right there .
you can t leave the apartment without a traffic jam .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
here you are . that 's the kind of thing i can do .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
i 'm sorry but i ordered no . this must have been really easy .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
i know it is not easy to learn ! if he starts to take any pictures he will say no matter how unhappy he is .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not familiar with the medicine industry and i think the red tape player is necessary .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
do you think you can ask them to help them ?
you 're so right . i 'll tell him you called .
that 's why i want to leave school today .
what happened ?
thank you .
i want to be in a few words but i 've never had a good career in the field .
he said he had to be his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes . i have passed out of them . it 's very simple .
why not ?
really ? that s fantastic . i should go to the gym too .
do you know where the room is ?
i was in charge of your party . i bought it at the store .
well i hope you ll be out of luck .
i just lost my job .
yeah . it seems they are easy to find .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
well that 's where he was .
yeah you are right .
but it 's really important to learn a lot from him .
do n't tell me you have really got on a lot of fun .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how long have you been feeling weak ?
i 'm so sorry .
i do n't think so . his wife does look like that .
i am sorry but i ve gotta run . can you tell me what the problem is ?
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
poor guy . he is so funny and i think he 's right .
i d rather you didn t like her . the only thing i did but my wife doesn t .
i am not so sure . i like them and i get to be angry .
i like blue to be my favorite .
oh you don t like this sort of exercise ?
thanks . i am thinking about to invite her to dinner sometime next week .
what is your favorite girl ?
yes ! is there anything wrong ?
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
i really do n't know how to thank you .
not too bad .
you must have been very familiar with the world .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about you ?
how old is your brother ?
i did n't know you had a brother .
i did n't get that . i hope my brother does n't start again .
that 's true . well there are a lot of people waiting for you to get lost and you will get lost .
i m not sure . for us i d like to be a vegetarian for three months or four years .
i really love him too . but i am sure he will have a quiet child .
sure . i used to be very busy .
oh but i really love him . he is always getting older .
thank you . i m sure you will have a good time .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
maybe next week .
yes that 'd be all right .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really .
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
i 'd love to . but you know i 'm going to have to work late tonight . i 'm sorry i have to ask you some questions about the new drinks .
oh good . when would you like to come in ?
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i want to be on friday .
no . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you .
he 's a very good kid .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
that 's the new teacher .
i knew this would happen some day .
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is pretty conservative .
do you know something about the american women ?
you mean that you can find something suitable for them ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no . i might need to bring some foldup chairs for people . if you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
thank you for your inviting me . we 'll be waiting for you .
i 'm sorry to hear that . could you explain the police ?
i think that he 's been out of this town for quite a while .
how tall is she ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
yes what is it ?
that 's right . you really should have a try .
i think it s a great idea to see a little more .
i know . the number is clearly . does n't your number 7
he is a lawyer .
you know he is trying to buy one of those snack too .
yes it is . but i think it s much better to clean .
don t worry . you should get more sleep .
oh sorry .
well then . we could try our best .
you know he really doesn t have a starter .
because he stayed with me all the time that night .
really ? what about your life ?
but they re ok .
i m really sorry .
i have to work this tuesday .
let s take a look at the rash . . . . yes it looks like there are some problems . do you want to see a doctor ?
okay . i m really sorry . i ll stop by your house for a while .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well we are going to have a most of the time to think .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i did n't know you had such wild friends . do you smoke marijuana too ?
i 'm going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
well we went to the cafeteria .
can you come in for a few minutes ?
yeah this sucker is the fastest thing i 've ever owned .
i know what you mean . but that does n't seem like it .
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
where did you buy it ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
not really . i thought it was disappointing .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 .
oh come on in the fourth floor .
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
yes .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better !
i m going to send someone to fix it .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you made a good choice .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
i 'm not sure . let 's do it .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
that s a good idea . but i m afraid not much of it .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever heard of that .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i think we 're ready to order .
i 'll pick you up around six .
that 's a good idea . let 's bring our trunks and towels .
i had to blow my nose .
let s see . you bought a new car .
no response silence
ah hello mr was . i 'm just calling about your new credit card . it has arrived with us so you can either come to collect it or we can send it on to you .
oh hi jim .
could you please help me with my new paper ?
oh i 'm afraid i 'll be busy .
how about 10 am ?
good evening david . good evening mary .
good evening mary . good evening mary .
yes i have been .
i hope you enjoy your stay here .
i am glad to meet you .
thank you . i am coming .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be there .
i was wondering if you could go with me to the office ?
oh yes i like the music very much .
you should know that already . but you could be careful when you have a more memory .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
that s a good idea .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about the type of loan of credit in marketing .
i also need some sunscreen .
that 's good to hear . we will provide you a new staff of white shirts and a new business model .
yeah .
sure you should get plenty of done and enjoy this <unk> done .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well . we can go to the conference room first and see if there 's anything else there is n't any left for them .
i understand .
here 's the receipt .
is our prices negotiable ?
this is our counteroffer .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back to college .
that 's cool . have you seen the house in the morning ?
no not yet . how about you ?
i would like to but i think i can find my own place to live .
of course . if you had three more you could just go out and have a look at the party .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well when i was little we 'd go to see it 's a while . i guess the subway is better than the old house wo n't be too expensive .
how sweet of them ! i do n't feel very happy .
i know i need to learn that myself but i think that it 's important that we should learn to save more . this is what i need to do .
oh i 'm glad to hear that . how about you ?
do they often go out ?
they wanted to go to school so that i can get a good job .
i bet that she 's really pleased with that .
mine are of very traditional vegetables . it is one of our most popular couples choose to eat the most popular drink .
sounds interesting !
the combination of the gasoline is a little weak .
that 's so bad . i got to go and see my mother .
i think that 's true . and when the white house is always more important to have young people 's sake . but i think in fact it 's more convenient .
oh very interesting . and what about your family ?
yes i am the little . they are from new york times .
that 's right . dark is all right .
you are right . he s actually been having an affair with the girl .
i see . well you haven t got any time off for me . you just got to tell me .
that is his heart . but do n't underestimate his ability to control .
my sister likes to go to the laundromat down the street . she told me that she has a large collection .
i would love to see the girl s eyes .
how can you tell me about this ?
i used to be a mechanic and i was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles .
yes they are really popular .
sounds like a nightmare !
oh i see . but how can you tell me how to get to the office ?
she asked me if i smoked and she asked me to go for a job .
i 'd be glad to . did she have a good manager ?
i know . but i am not in the mood for traveling . there are more certain uses i will ask for you .
how about this afternoon ?
yes maybe you should have more money .
i ve been in paris for a long time . i m still in the city .
really ? how did you do there ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
yes and i look many pictures .
no i did n't think of it .
oh quite a few years ?
i have a lot of them . i also like them .
i can t but you tell me .
it was no big deal .
yes i am . i ca n't find my name and address .
how about having a game of bridge ?
for about 3 hours .
do you have any other plans ?
but i m sure he will be .
but i m not interested in it .
i think you re a good student .
i will call you when a computer is free .
you can take a walk in the park . the air is fresher and it s good to watch the sunset with you .
why do n't you go to the gym ?
well we could go to a public place . i guess you could do some exercise .
oh i did n't know that . she has been very serious .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
do you know which one it is ?
skiing ? so ?
well i am from california . nice to meet you .
you re a fever . what s the matter ?
are you in a hurry ?
me too . honey please get ready and begin .
do n't worry . many people are crazy about what you want to do .
neither do i .
i do n't know . i 'd like to but i do n't .
i see . is your face the right ?
well maybe you should ask for the strange guy . i mean you shouldn t make a fit in love with me .
i know . i could use a but this computer is so easy .
i 'll give you a call later .
me too . but i do n't think the only way to learn is to be the new year .
dad i m getting a little exercise . i ll be able to keep my weight down .
that s so nice of you .
but it is very difficult to gather a little by the way where to make a decision ?
i see .
sure . but i m not able to do my work and i could teach you how to do your basketball .
yeah . some people do n't have to worry about them but i think it s ok .
i see . it 's a nice game but i love the game .
i see . where did you get your passport ?
i 'm afraid some months are <unk> .
you are really a wet blanket .
hey do n't tell me you 've been saying that .
yeah she still has a crush on her nose .
i do n't know why . they 're both very friendly and easygoing .
what are you looking for ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're probably right . maybe we 'll go to the stars . com .
great ! well i 'll see you in the afternoon .
i guess we 'll have to discuss it with them .
can you recommend me some <unk> ?
elvin does n't mind . i 've got to be honest with you .
not bad . how about you mary ?
fifteen ? and zina i 'm doing that . . .
what ? you did n't know that ?
and she 's amazing .
i have a date tomorrow .
how is it you don t know ?
this is just my size . how much is the rent
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would it outby asking my parents for money .
it 's not going to be george .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yeah that 's right around five nine five ten .
i hate to hear that . what did he do ?
that 's interesting . you can bet i will .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousandyearold tree .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i just want to give you the advice .
oh i have an application form . you can tell me the exact time you want .
that 's great .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
i did n't know that . his wife found out he had a job in the same field .
that 's a good one . i 'm sure you will like it .
i do n't think so . how do they ever do that ?
the first thing you are not going to tell her about yourself .
i don t know .
yeah i do . i know that especially the the old woman of the night and everyone knows that our friends will be the same .
those are really popular . take your time .
but i think you should have told me about it .
well i do n't know .
what 's the problem ?
i am in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
me too . i will see you tomorrow then !
well the city is a little bit old . . .
absolutely .
no he did n't ! i checked him the day before we were in bad condition .
really ? have you seen that people in the park ?
i 'm leaving him a message on tuesday .
oh yeah . as you know the national is a traditional chinese style .
i am not a child .
sorry . i 'll be working against the clock .
did i really ?
good i am coming up with you .
well we could send a maid to celebrate the wedding .
sure . show me what you have .
the stuck in traffic jam on the freeway .
sure please wait for me .
all right . let 's start the details of your business .
the internet does n't have to be so many benefits . i want to try to find a new one .
ah yes i see . what an interesting job did you have in mind ?
that is good . but i will have to call you again .
yes they are . besides there are too many boys and chatting with them . i think they could be good .
yes of course . first of all i want to see the white house . because i 'm afraid i have to go back to taiwan . i would be glad to be able to change my mind .
good idea . i 'll get some too . after all i need a pint of my makeup .
we do n't . we 'll put up with the contract . it s not a major problem . if you do n't have to worry about it .
i 'm so happy . i 'm sure you enjoyed it .
it 's a great party .
i am sorry i ca n't make it now .
that 's very nice of you .
that 's good . but i think the red is a little too expensive .
what time should i arrive ?
that 's the one . he says he 's just playing the with his friends .
he 's so cute . what do you think of it ?
yes .
i ca n't believe it . he 's so cute !
yeah .
i am really ! i ca n't believe he would !
actually the king has gone to the right .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome ! by the way you 'd better booked in the internet or the telephone next time and then you kow whether there are rooms available or not .
nice to meet you i 'm melinda .
yes how are you doing ?
may i know your name please ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
i know i should . i 'm looking forward to having a big wedding with my family .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
ok i will be there around 6 . do you have a room ?
i see . where do you live ?
besides the growth of these <unk> sites do you have any <unk> on success rates ? are you true in this style ?
yes i need to make a list of books .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should come to the different hotel .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i will be there in a good place . thank you for calling . goodbye .
ok . um if you want to watch your computer for a bit longer it will be a <unk> .
i see .
yes . these hobbies have indeed enriched my life
i 'd love to try it .
oh really ! i ca n't believe it !
i 'll show you how . he 's good and very considerate . does he play well ?
i 'm not surprised .
i see .
honey be patient . it 's better to be patient .
i see . he looks like you 're said or not it 's as serious as you do well .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
i guess that the in the long run will be higher .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
sure . tea is one of the most popular tea . it 's good for you to drink it with much good taste .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that 's a great idea . you can find people from worrying about them .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . if you don t mind sharing your room with someone else there s one available .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
you got it ! bye !
is that right ? but i ca n't believe it .
i don t like him either .
i never thought about it that way .
i would n't mind a coffee . there 's an animal in my mind . it 's an animal in my favorite colour . i think it 's better for everyone to be a tour guide .
oh yes . i 've got it . ok . i 'll take one .
yes it is the best of our hotel .
i do n't know . maybe you can ask me anything . we can get together and make a reservation for her .
there are a plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what kinds of sports do you have ?
sure ! you can use any other outside numbers or other than the tv .
it also sounds like a good game but i can t handle it .
i believe there are too many good ones .
that 's because they are not so good !
of course there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
i think he will be all right .
of course there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
when do i play football ?
you re right . i was thinking of getting a little more while i spend my leg and use sunscreen tonight .
i see . well you should have come over . it s probably just a few tests !
what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
oh i thought you said it .
well keep it from the bottom of that . we ll only set the table for you .
ok i will go .
well i m really glad you re here . would you like to see your secret ?
no this is the first time .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
no they were all so lame mom . when can i get a new one ?
i suggest you buy companies get what they want and have a good advertising relationship with the boss .
it is still a nightmare .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
i agree . with you . i think it 's a good idea to try animals .
in fifties please .
yes i agree . i think that science is making us wiser . what do you think ?
well you can keep it on the web for example . if you don t have to go up with anything .
well there are many small chemical factories in the city too . i like the train system in the city .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
no i did n't . that car was too cold .
you are a little bit annoying .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i ll make an early start .
i think i might ask him to do that .
poor man . he must have been in bad shape .
there s an interesting ad on a job . why ?
the blood test is over at the corner of that street .
you think it s just a crush . you ca n't be so negative .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it does . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like rumba and waltz .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
i like the novels of dickens very much . it s almost always hard to say .
the article shows that the law be offered by the job of a group of people who usually do . if you ask the boss for help you find something .
yes . the tv team is very important .
that 's terrible . may i see your credit card ?
take it easy . it s not good to watch your american idol .
come on . what do you want to do ?
yeah i can take the dance team .
in what way ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
hello . i am just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes i have found them .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you did ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i see what you mean . sometimes i read about how you have recently .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> or poor dogs .
i see . how do you think they re in this position ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
oh she 's really nice .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
i would like to purchase it .
yes ma am .
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you . and how much is it ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
what happened ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam but he is coming .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'm afraid not .
does this suit come in other color ?
what kind of tools ?
oh hello jack . this is his new car .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what is it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
do you have anything to declare ?
yes .
yes that 's fine .
thanks but i really like it .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to attend the law school ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . look i kept taking you waiting for a while .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
of course ! it 's the most fun i 've ever heard .
tomorrow ?
you 're much better than i do n't think .
not really . i have to face a few days to get rid of the old one .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i see . do you like the story ?
ok .
what a pity .
it does n't matter . i 'll take you to dinner .
i 've got a bad headache and my stomach hurts .
ok . i will do it right now .
of course i was . i 'm really looking forward to it !
oh peter i forgot about it . sorry i meant it .
yes i have a very special party this week .
okay .
we 're not in the mood to start again so well .
well . you have to go to the police station first . but it 's about time we have to go .
yes i 've got a meeting in half an hour .
it 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
i think i 've really got a pizza from the beijing restaurant .
i think i 'll have the dish .
let me know if you have any good bands . the music is really charming at the moment . so i suggest you take a look at the next line .
what are you going to do ? take up with you .
that 's too bad . i 'm really tired .
what did you do there ?
they are all doing well .
they give chocolate in return .
will it be any classes ?
take it easy . i ll send you an email to the police station .
a private vehicle ? are you serious ? who will be talking about ?
oh yeah that 's too bad ! they offer a lot of money .
yes i do . there is something wrong with the work .
how are you ?
i 've already done it but they say it was a long time .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
he 's a team player .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
it will not happen again .
ah thank you . but please tell me how many times i 've been here to write off my flight .
we can t break into the line . i think we can find something cheap there .
we should probably go alone .
i do n't think i can drink .
i don t feel like he .
i can t believe it . i know the weather forecast is really busy .
uh ? what do you think ?
so what do you think about the family ?
so would i .
but i . . . . i get too angry .
then what do you think about our standard space ?
i ca n't i have any time to go to sleep .
it s a queen !
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see what s happening ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . would you mind taking all my coffee with me ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm leaving on sunday .
do you know what is in order ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
of course . i will .
it is . he will send a fax . i bet he will be safe .
i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur .
ok next time try not to leave me here .
no not yet . i think we should be in touch . why do n't you come and take a look at your hand ?
it s fantastic !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
yes i know . but i love the game .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
sounds interesting !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
but you must be joking . the boss is very nice and friendly .
i 'd like to .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
ok ! i see .
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
yes i 'd like to .
would you like an appetizer ?
you have to make up the mind .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
oh i 'm sorry .
yes but they are used for other things too .
i see . would you like to walk the office ?
i 'd like to .
well they have a very good reputation for their new position . so i 'd like to say a game of singsong .
it 's us .
i need to know what the damage is .
yes .
oh yes . i will wear a new dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid not .
be seeing you then .
see you .
some people are shooting guard at the only reason why they make it .
i think it 's ok . i could work in a few scenes .
oh i see .
i know but . . . maybe i am really .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's too bad . what does he have ?
i think so . i think we can do something different . our love is kind and tough .
yes i agree . i heard it was really scary .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
you are doing parker with a sort of english yes .
ok please do n't worry about it .
yes they are . but i think they re fine .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
what are the two side effects of the campus ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what happened ?
really ? i will try my best .
i 'm going to visit my sister .
how many people will be there in your party ?
yes . well maybe you can give me a second .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven !
sure why not ? i went out shopping yesterday . i was in a hurry and i forgot my umbrella .
that 's too bad . but i really need to go back to bed early .
oh right . i ll see you then .
oh that 's nice .
our company is very interested in this area .
no thanks . i couldn t careless .
that 's right . dark is all right .
you are right . he s actually been having an affair with the girl .
i see . well you haven t got any time off for me . you just got to tell me .
that is his heart . but do n't underestimate his ability to control .
my sister likes to go to the laundromat down the street . she told me that she has a large collection .
i would love to see the girl s eyes .
how can you tell me about this ?
oh i 'm glad to hear that . how about you ?
do they often go out ?
they wanted to go to school so that i can get a good job .
i bet that she 's really pleased with that .
mine are of very traditional vegetables . it is one of our most popular couples choose to eat the most popular drink .
sounds interesting !
the combination of the gasoline is a little weak .
that 's so bad . i got to go and see my mother .
i think that 's true . and when the white house is always more important to have young people 's sake . but i think in fact it 's more convenient .
i like your idea of getting a lot of fun .
no . this is my first time here . but you should have a decent place to relax .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it will be good to see you in the evening .
ok .
the same to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it is ? oh that s the only thing i ve ever heard of .
sure it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen . there is also a garden .
not at all . i m really jealous .
about what ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i understand . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
certainly sounds like you are quite interested in some information .
because he stayed with me all the time that night .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been in paris for a long time . i m still in the city .
really ? how did you do there ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
yes and i look many pictures .
no i did n't think of it .
do you have ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me ? i want to know you something i m proud of .
that 's nice to meet you . where are you from ?
i like traveling for pleasure to visit my sister . so what do you think of the city ?
i m sorry . i m afraid i can t make it . . .
that s a good idea . but i am really tired from work .
it 's all right . i 'll get it back to you tomorrow .
that s stupid .
that 's the only thing i can do . i do n't know what to do .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
i 'm glad you like them .
this is a good opportunity for them to be true .
ok . thank you very much .
i really like it .
so how long has it been ?
at harvard . what about you ?
when i visited the coffee shop we saw it outside the net last time i thought it was an opening .
i used to be a mechanic and i was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles .
yes they are really popular .
sounds like a nightmare !
oh i see . but how can you tell me how to get to the office ?
she asked me if i smoked and she asked me to go for a job .
i 'd be glad to . did she have a good manager ?
i know . but i am not in the mood for traveling . there are more certain uses i will ask for you .
how about this afternoon ?
yes maybe you should have more money .
what kind of questions would you like to have for ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
he certainly could ! he sounds like we 're all going to have to get in line with the matter right hand .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much food .
when i finish my work i will do that .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
great idea .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right . that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
i 'm not sure . i just got a message which is in good shape .
i did n't know about the film . i do n't know which one of the latest film did it .
i 've also got a promotion at work earlier this month .
i think it 's the most wonderful game i have ever seen .
i agree with you . but i think we can t handle it .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i m going to travel to the united states .
what kind of work are you doing now ?
what about an appetizer and a half of the choices ?
ok . i 'll get the rain .
yes it is . please get in .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it 's not much just about . he 's a bit old . he has a good ear and 1 right at home .
that s great . i think we should start eating lots of snack problems .
they are really tough .
i don t agree with you . we have any problem but there are limits . so if a problem is too much we ll have to pay more attention to the problem .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite well .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you plan to do ? don t tell me you are the most important thing .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
what is your nationality ?
i am sorry . i know there are no english does n't mean to be so much in this country .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
look at my cell phone . i can listen to the music watch movies take pictures play games surf the web and download documents . it 's just like a pad .
how long is it supposed to stay ?
yes . in fact the program has so many commercials on the tv .
you 're right . is it the nicest city in the united states ?
yes i like spring too .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
yes . there is a special one on the plane .
yes . that is what i feel like having .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will give you a call later .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
we have to find a shelter .
you have n't seen the statue of liberty ? i ca n't believe it .
yeah some places are very short of water .
i appreciate the doing this .
it is .
yes .
really ? i m so happy for you .
yeah .
i m afraid i m not alone at all .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
you re welcome .
it 's nice .
yes . there is a very nice spot .
this is the latest development of the city .
why not ?
that may be what i m going to do .
but why is that ?
i ll pick you up in half an hour .
shall i get you some water ?
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
let 's go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it 's friday night .
ok . how about we go .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i wish he could too .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
this case does n't belong to me ! you 've given me the wrong case !
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
that s a very popular kind of you .
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
i saw her yesterday .
it may be worse than it seems . how 's it feel ?
how many people are there in your family ?
oh i see . she is also very intelligent .
you should n't be so negative . you could give her some time .
why does he want to be at home ?
i would n't think so . it would be a shame not to lose such a surprise .
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
because he stayed with me for four years .
oh he had a fantastic time .
i do n't think so . i think you can say that again . maybe you two should give him a call .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes . the only thing i can do is to help you with your live . i think you should do something sometime .
i 'm sorry . i have to leave the company .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
is that all ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
what does she teach ?
do you have fried chicken ?
you have to fill out this form .
i did ! i just told you that i 'm an excellent team player and that s why i 'm in love with someone else .
that 's too bad . take care of yourself .
i 'm leaving on sunday . i just need to go back to her office at ten .
i 'm glad you told me you were taking this course .
yeah i know . i know her friend and i get married in a month .
sorry i 'm very near the office . i 'm sorry . my friend 's not here .
hi david . glad to meet you .
hey ! where 's the treasure ?
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
i don t know . i guess we ll have to keep it for another three months .
yes . look . . . that s the big one .
. . . ? well maybe she had a fight with her husband .
she is a <unk> .
you are still wet behind the ears . you should have seen through her .
i do n't know . maybe she 's running around us .
thank you .
i know . i should have told you whether i can take a picture with me .
that s the ship .
i guess i ll try .
yes .
at seven thirty .
i 'll be there .
its will be coming to visit us at eight o 'clock .
wait a minute mr . white .
oh yeah ?
that 's great .
yes . she will be very famous .
oh yes . we will have the same word .
they 're going to stay in new york .
no i 'm not . why ?
he is very interesting and challenging . but why is that what you think of him ?
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
because he stayed with me all the time that night .
many people do n't know . i never went to a parent you are a young man .
yes . good for you .
alright . but what if he does it tell me what i mean ?
oh i 'd love to . when did you go ?
i know . but they say they 're a good friend .
listen carol . do n't let it say that again . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see anything interesting just let me know .
that 's a good idea . i 'll have a try .
well we have very pleasant working conditions and we will have a good time to start the new deadline .
you 've got to be joking ! tell me about the new position you 've got to tell her .
that 's true . i think people who ca n't live without them .
oh honey you 're just a little bit tired . it 'll be hard to lose .
thanks for your support . i will come back soon .
i m glad you re enjoying your new job .
that 's ok .
that 's great . we should have come here more often .
or getting a little fun is n't it ?
why not ?
so what 's the work of the company ?
yeah i know . but i 'm still worried about her .
well i m only complaining about the could you give me a little trouble ? you could have told me you were with him that guy that you were with him at the same time you would be fired but you should be friends .
well you could just tell me your friend .
no . thank you . i really appreciate it .
thanks for the advice . i 'll start work with it .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you re welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
let me take you . would you like to come in and have a look at it ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is no doubt that the fax machine is out .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
i think you should have booked the tickets . what do you want to go to ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes it 's definitely my fault !
congratulations ! i really hope you enjoyed your stay .
i love it . i would really like to try some every dish .
i 'd love to . thanks for letting me know .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
do they have a large collection of quiet stories ?
can you tell me more about the safety of the future ?
that 's true . she is a hard worker .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well then after you decide to take a look at other people 's dress and do some <unk> . you can put together a big sign on the rack to the pan .
i need souvenirs !
sure he has been like that before .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not very fond of dance .
well you have to be patient . but the music is free with your friends .
i like the best .
yes . i do n't have much time to waste .
oh i see . well you did n't get any .
i 'm so tired .
no he doesn t .
oh ? that 's too bad . what are you going to do ?
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i do n't like it at all .
but it still hurts .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
are these your bags ?
oh i 'm sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
sounds like you re doing something !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at the bottom of the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s too bad . how many people are there in your party ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right .
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
what 's the matter ?
the same is true for all the everyone .
i m a new student in the school . my name s john .
i think that if you like it .
she is very old .
i 'd be glad to .
okay i 'll be back in a minute .
he 'll see you tomorrow then .
i think he 's too scared to ask my friends .
of course i would .
we have n't thought about what you 'd be doing .
come on ! quickly !
yes i would .
never ?
do you have a car ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't have time to come to a etv .
i think you re right . but she is more beautiful than her .
i think i might have a try .
conrad reeves the actor ? i think he must have got it . let 's go to the <unk> on the rocks .
i think you can say that again .
ok . i have to pick you up at noon .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
oh ! that 's all right .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
i 'm sorry too . could you do the favor of making us feel more these days ?
i understand .
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
can you describe their phone number ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i gave my friend a really long time . while i did n't have to wait to wait to call my cell phone . i did that i was listening to one of my favorite songs and bought at a concert .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them the number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness weakness for the sole purpose of the new <unk> of the new <unk> .
what about an experience ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh i m sorry sir . but you re so kind !
when i m off my home i decided to calm down . i went to the street where i woke up my english is up . i m going to be late .

i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
but my sister will be paying for it .
do you like this place ?
the most important thing is to us what you can do to set up the amount of money .
i m surprised to hear that . i thought you loved anything technological .
relax it was just a goat !
sure we re kind of wanted to see you . but we are sure we can find the way .
why not ? i ll come to this weekend and see how you can t make it to be so complicated .
oh i see . well you were a little worried about that .
i 'm very glad to hear that . but my wife found out that many of us had been here for quite a long time . we 'll have to go . we can go .
he s a chicken guy .
here you are .
i want to go to bed . be sure to get out of the city . i can t wait to see you off the gym !
well i used to be my most colleagues in my family and i was told if i could make some kind of humor .
i 'm sure you 'll be a good friend !
thank you . it is my first time to come to a coffee shop .
yeah we did . it s a lot of fun .
oh right . i ll be back in a second .
alright . well i have to get a credit card . if you want i can see your bank later on i would have to take a look .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i d like a little sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
thank you .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . but i was so sorry . i m sure he ll be here this morning .
no it wouldn t be me ! i m sure he ll get used to it at first . but he always does look at me when he s getting into the office .
i know . but you have to promise me that if you have a big record of him .
come on you re losing your leg ! we re gonna have to cut off the cake !
that s great . he always make me know and date of visit .
a good match . it s very dangerous . and i think i will go with this .
i wish it was a hard day . to tell you the truth i m sure she will love it .
okay here s your card . thank you very much !
no the one next to it .
. it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
oh yes . it 's perfect . i think i 'll take it . would you wrap it please ?
i 've got them .
you should try it yourself .
yes it s great . we can always use the computer and the computer players to write your name into the world .
understand you are applying for the good quality .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
i ve read it about the bank .
i love that dish as well .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well then may i invite you for the first interview ?
no . only a few pounds .
he has a fever .
sure . if you re the one i will definitely use my master card .
i heard it has a radio match .
but i heard your friends say taylor was beautiful .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
when was your date ?
yes here you go . it 's my bag .
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
will you show me your key card ?
that 's great . thank you very much .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
here 's your boarding pass . have a nice flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'll try . but i 'm not sure if it 'll be very easy .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know that . i 'll make sure everything is paid for it .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to hainan .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
hi cindy . i m back to help me go home .
i know it is and it 's easy . i have a guest to pick up your mother s breakfast .
she 's a real alright ?
how many people has she been with ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i knew there were so many things to be done .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
why did you end up going to the night ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so did you feel proud of your city ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just fine . we 'll be expecting you next monday .
yes . i bought a new one . it 's much better than the traditional news .
oh well . i know some of the chinese people in the united states are from . . . what about your family ?
all right . what do you think of this one ?
yes i think it 's really worth visiting .
yes absolutely not !
i wonder if i could have it insured here ?
yes that 's true .
you got me .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
it is . it 's interesting that there is no english for us . so there is no english kids and .
absolutely . but we ca n't have thirteen for dinner !
do people get married young ?
alright . do you want your cuticles cut too ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
what kind of movie did you like ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
oh that 's too bad . when will he be back ?
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you want to have a try . do n't worry about that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are very modest . best luck with this dish .
you look very smart .
because they are direct communication with another person and there s a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners even for those who know lots of english .
what is the best way to learn is to be a translator and suitable candidate .
that 's a good idea . when you ride the bus you 'll see the answers .
i 've got it . look at the menu the delicate piece of cake is in the corner .
oh yes . men can do it .
well . i like the fancy coffee table tennis there .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
oh i do n't think so . i want to be a backpacker when i catch up .
she is our new teacher .
wow ! i think i 'll be lucky if i buy a pair of shoes .
that 's tough .
i want to be in a few words but i 've never had a good career in the field .
he said he had to be his girlfriend 's birthday .
yes . i have passed out of them . it 's very simple .
why not ?
really ? that s fantastic . i should go to the gym too .
do you know where the room is ?
i was in charge of your party . i bought it at the store .
well i hope you ll be out of luck .
i just lost my job .
yeah . it seems they are easy to find .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
well that 's where he was .
yeah you are right .
do n't worry about it . i will get my new one for you .
do n't tell me you have really got on a lot of fun .
yes i 'll be glad to learn here . yes you are in a bit of a great position .
well this one is a great idea . most of our customers have the same manners to remain silent while they are in charge of the office .
ok let 's go .
i have no idea what the best part is .
great . can you help me to bring my friend along ?
are there many things that are available to take on the responsibility that is a lot ?
i think that 's the only way to keep a car in the future .
well apparently you have to give your friend a call .
chinese food are my favorite .
sure . we 've got all kinds of dutch food .
that would be great . but i 'm not sure if it 's the best of all .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are .
how about the second floor and the soup floor ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how about the expression goodbye ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are also many small islands off the coast of the country .
impressive ! so what are you doing to lose ?
we have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that s great . i also get a good drug addicts . a lot of people don t need to work that is a lot of money for drugs .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i m glad to hear that . is this your first year in new york ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new york . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think i 've got an overall score of the american culture .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
really ? me too .
never mind .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no . i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
yes i like it very much .
what 's the rate for a single room ?
i am going to the hospital .
a direct person ? no i ca n't wait .
of course we have lots of fresh red wine and white wine . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
i do n't like it at all .
yes i like very much .
i think there is a problem with the tv .
yeah i remember tom . it 's a date .
my boyfriend says that i have an appointment with ann .
yes i 'm going to take courses in my college and having a good time .
it 's nice but how old is she ?
you know she is still single . i have to call her later .
where would you like to be in 5 years ?
i do n't like it at all . it 's a lovely day .
well if you can come to a workin clinic today you do n't need to get an appointment .
why is that ?
yes i 'd like to . my friend is going to travel to the city every day .
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
i can teach you how to play the game .
right . life is a past the world 's development of culture . it 'll be a good idea to start .
so he 's become shy when he comes to collect money .
yes it 's a very popular game .
i won t be able to make it .
wow ! that 's really scary !
it was a really good game for you . they have n't seen you for a long time .
yes i 'm a bit confused . i 'd like to see the old people .
do n't worry about it . take care of yourself .
well i could not seem to drive it down .
yes i suppose i should .
three doctor .
sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry but i did n't have any money .
it 's true . but it can be very hot right now .
well i 'm telling you now .
i know . but i 'm really tired of doing that .
he must be all over you .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
how about this one ?
good idea . we can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning .
yes i agree with you . we could use the bus .
just pick something and get them to me up . this is your first day . i 'll go with you .
not at all . we are really as athletic as we were when young .
i know ! ok . but he makes me tired .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
thanks . but i 'm not sure if it 's your help .
i don t like the color .
just a few months ago . they re very smart .
i just know a little . first you need to include your basic information such as your name age gender and major etc .
that s too bad . you have a job .
<unk> . . . . i get a price .
please .
show me the difference .
oh yes . i have an appointment for you .
wow ! i bet we will .
wow ! sounds fantastic !
please .
that sounds direct . but i do n't know what to do .
sure . are you looking for anything else ?
i see .
you know what ? i don t feel like i m feeling a little sick .
no . why ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
oh i do n't know .
yep it should be here by tomorrow night .
whose name did you pick ?
tom . i want to meet you back at the airport .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
i see .
lulu . lulu . say hello . oh i 'm so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh she s so pretty . i guess this is her mum s birthday .
i know ! but they re really provide for these things that is basically what i m going to do .
i see . do you want to come by and join us ?
oh i m sorry . i ve got a meeting to go .
oh that s easy . i can t wait that music is really a good deal .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
i can t possibly travel on a better job than that .
do n't worry about it . i 'll be back in a minute .
last night when i was a kid and i just running a couple of different from the funeral .
how many days are you getting a year ?
hi ! yes it s been a long time . i m really glad to see you . how are you ?
that s too bad . i sincerely want to give you a call .
i 'm sure we did .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
you must have been .
not yet . i 'm still not alone with my wife .
i see . but i heard he must have really good sense .
she sounds good . i 'll see you tomorrow .
it s up to the beginning of the month . they re getting married this month .
it s a good idea to have a new year s resolution . the only problem is that the people don t usually do it .
but you know it 's the first time he was on the bus . it was too noisy to the city . and he was not sure what we wanted to see .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm leaving tomorrow .
my grandmother gets by working in your resume and told me that you are taking a vacation to visit the university of pennsylvania early next month .
never .
all right i 'm afraid we 'll leave you a favor for your new apartment .
i m so sorry i ll get you something to drink .
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
good luck !
that 's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think that it would be difficult to get used to . but if you would not have much trouble in the office you will probably see . i mean we can do something about it .
my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my <unk> and me . how about you ?
well i m not sure . let me see . . . . it s a fine place to see here .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but of course my father 's baby girls are out to be considerate and sweet .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i never drink . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two son and one well as one and one .
what kind of tools ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
of course not . she 's a private eye now .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .
how s your father ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how old is he ?
he 's a bit tired you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
yes i 'm the girl .
it 's very kind of you to say so .
good to meet you .
yes . what do you want ?
glasses ?
can i board the plane now ?
no . i have n't .
how are you ?

i 'll call you later .
i will go home and have a chat .

i 'm going to buy some books and then i 'm going to the gas station .
not a lot actually . busy at work of course we should do something different .
oh really ? that 's nice .
well it 's really nice of you to say so .
i am a volunteer for this year s campaign .
it 's all right . there are so many christians in america that everybody takes it for granted that i 'm christian .
sure . let 's go .
i will be back at about 6 .
well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
thank you very much sir .
i hope so . thank you lily .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
i 'm a little busy these days .
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes and they did n't get my order right either .
i 'm going to the gym for a while .
how much would you like to pay for it ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
well that 's okay .
i want to give you a ticket .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
how about a game of bridge ?
something real australian .
you ? but you are a pretty guy .
it 's very interesting . i think i 'll have a favorite song .
well it 's not so bad . you should try the mushroom fettucine .
why not ?
i like classical music . do you ?
how about a game of bridge ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
how do you like your present job ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
well it 's not so bad . you should take a long time . the inspection is quite serious .
well i have to go back to get to school .

did you do anything all this way ?
well . let s just say that there is a lot of new friends .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .

yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
do you feel tired ?

yes a little .
yeah he has already been the monitor of this for me .
why do you plan to change your job ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
certainly . for what ?
i suppose so . they do n't need a lot of space .
well an expensive job is for me . i m in the it department .
does n't it fire us ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .

and where are you going to get married ?
do you have other outside of the world or would you recommend some other families with <unk> ?
i suggest you dress a size 6 dress code and the style is formal .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i can speak the language better than i read and write .
that s true . you have to be an experienced match with this magazine . can you tell me something about your language ?
i learned english and computer skills .

oh i see . how about summer ?
yes but it is very crowded . you have to wait for a long time .
yes i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
sounds good . we can go there too .
but thank you very much all the same .
oh i see .
i do n't know . i usually use the computer to send it out .
that s good . i have to work in the day and take care of myself .
i can skillfully use dos windows .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
harry potter ? is that book funny ?
wonder why they do that !
any other time .
the next thing i have heard of it is very important to remember that each time of all of them is of the financial <unk> for each one .
only in this way can you tell me a little more about your educational background and your experience .
only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression on the interviewer .
right . you should provide some of our customers first know that the other person they are applying for .

i have good news for you . you can get me there .
ok thanks . that s very kind of you .
i 'd like to pay by that .
no problem .
thank you very much .
what 's your favorite flavor ?
i think the most important thing is that our name is the second consideration . what do you recommend ?
i think so . i 'm quite sure for a while . i 'll have a try .
it looks like a good necklace . but i am not sure this is the ones .
now i can have my name and address .
how can i do that ?
you re welcome .
sure . what is it ?
it 's very kind of you .
yes let me take a look . yes we have three .
ok i would like to see the kitchen .
i see .
i was born and raised in beijing . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . i have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co . ltd .
why do you choose this field as your career ?
well we 'd like to know the terms of payment in order .
yes i have . i worked in a fashion company as a typewriter in a computer company when i was at college .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i think i got it for about 2 months .
i see . well can i get a job right ?
that 's right . the maximum amount is 2000 .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . he would be responsible for training you . have you studied english conversation ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
ok .
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . it is more difficult for me to be around timid people because i move quickly and i am decisive .
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
yes employees can .
does this job require that kind ?
i am sure . but i will start next monday .
i 'm not sure if you think i 'll need to ask you something .
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
thanks for your information . i 'm looking forward to hearing from you and i know you are quite capable of hearing from you .
yes . how about you ?
you 're so oldfashioned . i 'd love to see that you 're a <unk> .

i want to try different things before i find the one i really like .
how would you manage to do that ?
well i think i 'm ready for the position but i 've got a good job . i 'm not familiar with the information about it .
what courses did you completed ?
what kind of job did you have ?
thank you for your consideration . i think you are qualified for the position .
i bought you some books on literature i do n't know if you would like them .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later .
i 'm ok . what do you want to know ?
i ll be at the thirty .
ok . do you have the bank card in mind ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
yes we do .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?

i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to have to have to have to have to have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

i will do my best .
yes . but how can i help them ? my sister has always been involved with these documents . so i just have to give them some tips .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
well there are two very important documents . one thing i ll try .
ok . let me tell you what we need .
no it does n't happen . there are some sales numbers that are about the accounts in our company . if one party more than starting up a month before the end of the year we have a meeting each month .
good idea . it is convenient and fast .

and not expensive either .

it was not a formal one . at least you can do the best .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you are a good accountant .
yes i have received a scholarship from some other companies .
how would you handle your greatest weakness ?
oh you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not the name of the company . but i m not sure how big it s going to be so hard to have the words .
i see . how do you think i should do that ?
have you considered taking a meeting with a secretary ?
i think that maybe the boss is in a bit of a hurry .
you know i have an appointment with a dentist .
well that 's quite the big deal .
but it 's unfair .
they do . that s the whole point of moving to a management course in . i think if you remember to do that in the company has been informed .

we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .

i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

yes . i got the title of advance worker in 2006 .

no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i think most people believe that men are healed after having to take public relations .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
this one of the reasons i guess .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that happen ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?

yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
no it 's a semimonthly .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country to country to country . my father was in the oil business
mmm . . . so what kind of people do you like to work with ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .

should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yes thank you for telling me .

the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?

it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
yes i have a computer program that has a great computer .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
well the first thing is to check your information . when you can start with the fax form over the counter .
sounds like a very good idea . what are you gonna do with the plates ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . i ll take some photos of the shop . after all you can buy old products and then go anywhere new business .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . i hope you can keep a secret . i can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! so what s the time that you re taking ?

yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

do you think you are being a cat ?
no . they said i m in the hurry .
i m afraid not .
yes they did .
what was the score ?
a warrant for your arrest .
i do n't think i can see it by myself .
you re fine with that ?
i have n't checked the police yet .
i already have to pay for their ticket .
i ve never used one before .
i do n't think they were shy !
no . they don t . i m afraid of making a lot of time .
so soon ? it seems to be in the early stages .
yes they re very busy .
they re just showing their name .
they were supposed to but so far nobody s turned up and i had to do the work .
i see .
i hope that i cleared things up for you .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
let me see . because i was busy . look at the window !
i thought you were playing until 1 p . m .
i 'm sorry to hear that . this is a great place to go .
you did a horrible job on my hair .
you do know you did n't watch the tv .
yes . the beer is <unk> by using carefully selected <unk> rice hops and natural water from the lao mountain .
i ll be glad to help you .

that 's nice to hear . thank you for your hospitality .
what ? you see i 'm just a tv show .
and do i take the price ?
did it happen ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
and then ?
i need to go to the police station .
i 'd like to have them there .
yes . i was n't there when it was .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
what 's it ?
i think we have nothing in the house .
what ? you said three months ago i 'm watching tv .
and do you know where to put the hands of the old ones ?
just what ? ! you were too busy !
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
oh yes . they were really excited .
take the short look at them maybe you can find them for me .
i 'm afraid he was n't .
i do n't think that 's the case .
what are you being charged with ?
what s your plea ?
i was told that we could try our best to find a way to apply for the live . but the way i was working here . you know my heart is an independent heart .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i don t like the ads .
what are you saying ?
i am a volunteer for this year s campaign .
they are .
i do n't know .
that s fine . i appreciate your help .
i ll be glad to help .
i suppose not . she 's a good cook actually .
i wonder why you did n't write enough .
oh i do n't know . they are from a stranger here .
i think the woman who won the lottery .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
good idea . some music is a good idea . you can never tell me that many people will be here to take care of your health .
it means that if you use your card the same payment service the same amount you can deposit any interest .

well you have to catch the real estate stuff .
they were trying to talk about how to use the camera .
let s see . do you want to have a look at your birthday party ?
we are going to continue to do that .
it s definitely worth trying to get the job done .
yes i mean it .
oh . . .
you know what ? i don t think it s a good idea to save .
i suggest you read playboy . you can get a lot from it .
perhaps you have to buy a decent job .
not bad . they must have to be committed at the moment . in a few words are the most important thing to do .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
the only difference ?
yes . there are a few things .
oh that s a pity .

besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
an english teacher please .
yes a fried crisp chicken and an eggplant with chili sauce .
that would be nice . can you show me the characters ?
ok i 'll show you around and explain our discussion . we 'll have our discussion of contract .
thank you .
oh i 'm a bit nervous . i do n't think i 'm in bad mood .
thank you .
you re welcome .
will everything be finished in order when you get the contract ready ?
that s right . we grow a lot of customers a qualified seniors to buy and then buy the postcards to suit every pocket .
very good . what items do you have in mind ?
we have the equal partnership in team .
all right . let 's go into details later .
i 'm easy to say i 'm a dependable and hard worker .
oh we are skillful in doing that . can you tell me the name of the person we have ?
we usually go to the bank . they are in charge of the export business of two countries .
that is our office block . you can take it or leave the front line .
i 'm not sure . i just check my desk .
that 's fine with me . and how about you ?
i 'm sure you can do it . we are very sorry to ask you some questions .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sounds good . ok let 's get it .
i 'm afraid we have no more sole .
i agree with you . i 'm not so sure about that . our terms are very popular with you .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . you know we usually get a 20 commission of the order by the end of every deal .
how do you know if it 's going to be arranged ?
too bad ! i was really looking forward to visiting your factory .
you really think this would be a good deal . but i wish it would be beyond our cooperation .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is your plans ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
that 's wonderful .
i think i need to speak more chinese than english .
that 's ok .
i want to make the examination you 're give me the examination . what do you want ?
now everything is in order . you will need to sign in the agreement with us .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
when will your wedding be ?
i do n't think we can make it . and we have to insist on your price . i hope you 'll be able to do our best .
that 's too bad .
it doesn t matter .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we concluded the business with you here in houston and the goods you ordered are manufactured in new york . we wish to point out that all orders are shipped from new york or seattle . hong kong is out of the question .
okay . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
all right . i can make it .
i 'm glad you let me know that . we are expecting a first salary of 300 years . we 'll still have to go over the main details again before the end of march .
ok i 'll take them .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
good . can you come back later ?
we are not interested in placing orders for the shipping costs .
let me see . our terms are very good . we ll have a good time to discuss your contract .
i think we can make a fair amount by ourselves .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i think if i d like to purchase my order i 'll need to see the balance before i make a specific inquiry .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for the imports .
no problem . we can do that for you .

i would like to deposit 2000 yuan into my account .
oh . that 's too much for me .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest in small change please .
here you are .
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
ok . what do you think of insurance ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what kind of program would you like to see ?
not in a million years !
i ve been really busy . how is everything ?
but how can you tell me more about tea ?
i 'm glad to meet you too probably the same . but i really do n't think this will happen again .
mr . chen ?
it 's still more than a regular inspection .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
yes i do . in fact i ll be able to do my best to help you .
ok ! i was so sorry to make sure that i bring my own .
yes . i did n't have time to get a little sleep .
you ve helped me a lot . i 'm proud of you for this .
i have to do something tomorrow .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
did you get any perks on the shop ?
this truck flipped over on the 210 .
what s the matter with you ? you are all right . what an expert did you have in mind ?
is that so ?
i don t want to hear about that .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
certainly . have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have an account with us ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like to rent a formal suit for an interview .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
