what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in five kilo weights . five kilo weights should be enough . now it 's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .

yes .
how about you ? when are you leaving for ?

do you know where the copy room is ?
yes of course . it seems made to measure .
i think you 're making a strange decision .
yes i 'm sure i 'll be very pleased .
but you did n't . that 's all for today .
the small gift package includes all kinds of magazines and animal products . they are very fresh .
yes we 'd like to have your regular dinner . what courses are there please ?

that is our counteroffer .
our guest is really tough .
great . i 'll take this one . will you please tell me where the copy room is ?
that 's great . we can also find some jobs to sell through them .
i would have to get a few pictures of the house . we also have a beautiful and wide range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
ok let 's go .
is that a good idea ?
where is it ?
i could n't find the files you request even though i checked all the crossreferences . i do n't think it 's andy either .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
ok i like that .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually in my opinion the weather is so nice .
i have no idea what you would like to see .

i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
no thanks i 'll pass . it looks very tempting though .
oh well perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead .
i ca n't bear it that emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
yes they are . you must have spent much time on it .
i suppose that the designers hold these fashion shows like women because they are not allowed to wear high marks .
how would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ?
and they 're so thin !
well they 're on sale today for only 1 .
he had a great time .

ok i 'll have it .
yes and would you like some soup ?
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
sure . dinner is famous for its seafood .
do you know what to order ?
in the beginning of the interview you should make a clear answer before you come .
good . i suppose you can make fun of it .
we are very glad to hear that .
i ca n't understand him . he 's very interesting .
here you are .
thank you .
yes we do . may i ask you some ?
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
rice egg beef and vegetables .
sounds good . i 'd like a hamburger please .
yes . it 's one .
do you know when it leaves ?
you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .

certainly ! would you care for dessert ?
yes . i 'm afraid we have n't had any .
which one do you prefer ?

then i 'd like the whole cup of tea .
it 's good .
i 've got whiskey and brandy but i need some beer and soda . that s all .

if you tried to blow it out i think i 'll go crazy .
it 's going to be a lot of cash order . let 's check it out .
i don t think that is too much for rent .
i think i might like it .
certainly . here you are . many travelers have had an appointment . they say you can take the right elevator .
what kind of dessert would you like ?
did you have a foot massage ? i think i might have a dahl .
how would you like your steak ? rare or welldone ?
medium .

one thing 's certain . it 's a oneyear warranty .
to be honest it 's not like you had a good time .
and would you like to have a look at the color ?
well it depends . what kind of car are you going to have to pay for it ?
well i 'm not really in the mood for .
it 's already a deal .
that s a hefty amount . but that should have no problem at all . you should be aware that an employee should be aware of the cartons are waterproof and the total amount is for the total of five dollars .
do n't mention it . just call me .
i 've got a few light idea .

sure . but you can park in this city .
definitely . i think it 's enough for people to stop floating and go to where they come from school . you will enjoy the trip .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it was n't me .
that 's all right . please go ahead .
ok . i will be back in a minute .
hi .

thanks very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .

i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .

well i 'll try this one . it looks good . can i take it ?
not bad . actually it makes me look younger . i like it .
if you really like it then you 're not going to drive your car .
you have made a good choice . i 'll take it .
yes . we have both the same style in red and white black .
maybe we should look at an outlet .
of course . i will show you the fitting room .

yes we can do that .

i can give you a hand .
i am looking for a job .
yes we have a full selection of colors . they are all handmade .
it 's not really very practical . i do n't like the color .

i got it .
ok i 'll take it .
i 'll pay for it . here 's the receipt .
yes .

ok . i 'm going to let you go .
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
do you think that is our office environment ?
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
no i bought them a few times .

let me have the fruit cocktail .
we have a special where you 'll like to get a bowl of beef .
can you make it ?
anything else sir ?
i 'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea .
of course . it s a bit difficult to figure out what you want .
yeah . he is the best man we 've ever tried .
if he 's not in the mood for one more yes he 's not so young .
yes but the telephone is very busy at the moment .
when will you buy it then ?
okay . is this the first time to check in ?
just some medicine . we have about it .
does that include utilities ?
benjamin starts to run and check the police .
i appreciate your understanding .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that s not all right . i have a bad day .
i 'd rather not . i do n't want to be like it .
i 'm going to do it later .
yes of course . follow me please .
i hope it 's not turning on .
not long . it 's a really long way to go .
how many miles to go ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
well i do n't think so . my daughter bought the first day she fell in love with me .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the corner .
is the traffic very heavy on this road ?
that 's right . go ahead please .
what about april ?
no it 's only a walk . you can t miss it .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
sorry but i m not really interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
who cares ? it 's just online . it 's not real . you know who i am a member of the company .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
oh i don t care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes they are very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
thank you . do i have to pay duty if i want to buy something ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the third floor .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada for 110 of the price of the real thing .
how about this one ?
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you have made a good choice .
yes i 'd like to have a look at the 2 piece suit .
this is kevin .
no i ca n't now . i 'm just waiting for my call .
well you could have some questions about them .
do you know how to set the timer ?
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
i know . can she call me back and ask her to get her some food ?
well it 's a cheap place for students to get a new year 's resolution .
i do n't know how much i want .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
well your family and i are very happy to get a drink .
which facial would you recommend ?
i am not good at it because i am a designer and i need to make some tasty proposals .
ok . let s go and have a great time .
is it close by ?
really ? that 's nice . let 's go there for days .
well to be honest i 'm afraid i ca n't see kids today .
what store did you get ?
no thanks . that will be all .
will you have it strong or weak ?
i do n't know .
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
ok . my name is benjamin .

yes . by the way can i make a list of the courses you want ?
that s fine . i ll call you later .

the exhibits are really special . you can learn a lot from them .
could you please hurry ? i have to get out of the building .
ok .
ok boy . i will buy it for you .
we should do this more often .
do you have to pay to use the machine ?
i do n't know . it 's going to be a red wine .
ok . do you want to have an ice cream with you ?
actually our restaurant has great prestige .
i am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of project manager .
i usually have cereal for spicy food .
i see . do you have any other questions for your birthday ?
how about saturday morning ?
ok . i 'll have a try .
how much would you like to pay ?
i 've never heard of such a thing . can i go to my place for my friend ?
i see . the problem is that there is a problem with a tornado warning .
no wonder people from china 's economic law .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
can i interest you in an appetizer ?
i m looking for a sharp dvd player .
you are in good shape . the first two years are you going to be very pleased with the performance .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
where do they come from ?
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are 8a 8b and 8c .
i agree how much ?
i think you are the right candidate for the position .
sure but i do n't drink much . so i do n't know what to order .
so how about an aperitif ?
let me see . en . . a large order of four pieces of fried chicken dishes are sold out .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
can you recommend one ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and over ice .
how can you tell me about this ?
here we go .
thank you very much .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
let 's see . yes that 's the latest issue of human beings .
ok . i 'll have a try .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
i do n't like it . i 'm sure you will like it .
maybe they have both .
are you kidding me ?
they taste so good . they taste delicious .
i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
you 'll be right . it 's really worth seeing .
name it .
i 'd like to order a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
hmm . i think they must be getting fat .
is n't that served ? they have a delicious red wine .
blah . . . what 's that ?
ok i m sorry . i must have been in town this week .
go ahead .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
what do you think the biggest cinnamon toast ?
do you have a taste for me ?
yes . i have been saving up many different kinds of things .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i m going to the store to buy some . i think you ll have to see it .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
what are you doing to check out ?
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'll bet .
is she helping out ?
what symptoms does she have ?
really ? did you write a blog ?
do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
can you hold them for me please ?
thank you for your compliment . won t you try this fish with white sauce ? i 'm rather round of it .
what 's the problem ?
are you scared of anything ?
we have a copy of your order here . may i help you ?
what 's wrong with your job ?
you are booked on the on at <unk> pm to hong kong with cathy pacific .
so you have your own car ?
you 'll get a burger too .
how much is the pay ?
but we have a policy of paying him for it .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
so do i .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i 'm glad she 's out of the way .
by all means .
i see . thank you very much .
i 'm not . i 'm just in the mood for the night .
that 's right .
you should take their advice . they wo n't ask the interviewer for you .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i see .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
that sounds good . can you tell me where it is ?
i will just use a different style for example .
i 'm afraid i ca n't catch you any more .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . you know we have been looking for an executive secretary with good english skills and some business background . we looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes this is still a routine board . could you send me an fax please ?
is it cold on the floor ? i hate to have a picnic with my friends .
i wrote the check out for way too much .
yes it is really a weekly .
it 's not like it .
yes . please .
is everything in the fridge leftovers ? i hate leftovers !
we will need to do an investigation on this .
right just call me .
what 's your number ?
that s great .
bye .
who did it say ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i do n't have time to go to school .
i would like to see you 're not going to be late .
i know but i know i know it is hard to take a class to get .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
and i 'd like to have the study .
they say my hair is too long my room is too dirty and i am not good enough at school .
yes it does look a bit sore . let s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
jog ?
then you are to walk to work .
walk ?
thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
oh no .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
oh dear .
and three times a week you can either swim play <unk> or hand ball .
oh no .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
dance class ! i do n't know how .
you will .
oh . . .
oh where was that ?
i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
well it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
she will be 86 next month .
that is truly amazing !
how about taking a walk in the park ?
ok . it 's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
oh it 's so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves only you and me !
that 's just now we 've got to go . tell me !
oh i see them . some are doing taijiquan some are performing swordplay some are practising the chinese wushu .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
good idea . we 'll be in touch .
are you a football player ?
do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ?
ok then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes . which pair do you want ?
yes i want to have a photo .
let me give you a hand . the author is . . .
margaret mitchell .
oh yes . here it is .
thank you very much . i have been looking for it for a long time . is this the latest edition ?
yes we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ?
how about the price of the hardcover ?
it 's 25 .
a little bit expensive but i will buy one . this is 25 here you are .
oh yes if you like . the large one goes to washington . the other one i will take with you . all right ?

no i am sorry . i have only a single ticket .
it 's a deal . we 'd like to have company come to an agreement . how 's your new house ?

it s very nice of you . we look forward to seeing you in june .

it will cost you 10 .
ok i will take a look at it .
well i think it will be possible . thanks very much .

it was n't too bad . at lease i 'm alive .
i 'm tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
sure . let 's check out the bedroom and bathroom .
a description of your license plate was caught on a site . you should be aware of the case because it is not up .
have you ever heard of motor coaching ? it is just a time to check the size of the fine print .
i took a few diving classes but i did n't really like it so i made a good deal .
you are probably right . they will just have to be there .
no but i 'd be getting somebody else 's problem .
that s not a bad idea . they must have been pretty good .
yes ! i was in the bank at the time that i am on my way to <unk> trip .
all right . please hold the line .
yes . but the place is falling apart !
i also heard the fax machine is essential and i can call the information you feel uncomfortable when they are quiet .

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
me ? i 'm jane . she 's very nice to meet you .

let me see . oh yes . your room number is . the porter will lead you to your room .
i 'm afraid i do n't . i 'll have a beer .
but i still love going to be a part of the culture .
how long will it take to get there ?
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at s department store .
what are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ?
i was denied a visa ?
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . does it zip closed ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
can you tell me about the choices you have to pay for this ?
because i needed to know how to improve myself .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
the show is almost made of pure silk . it 's a pity that they do n't make the right decision .
no it 's not . it 's a good thing you can do .
we 're very interested in the new apartment .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
the ones that are on sale are from central america .
we have a problem with our roof . can you come and see it ?
how about oil or spray ?
yes please .
i 'll be back as soon as possible . oh i almost forgot i 'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in .

i 'm afraid that i ca n't come to see you tomorrow .
it 's nothing .
what is the address ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
so mom . can i get a load of it ?
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
yes the price was for word processing .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
maybe i should just get it out of the way .
it 's like a citrus fruit .
what they 're they ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
well they are .
where do you grow them ?
i guess you can buy them either .
i come from america .
well we just got in some mangoes .

how do i know if it 's ripe ?

most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .

ok you re welcome .
thank you very much .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?

yes i 'm going to the bank to see the opening application . i have just come in and visit the famous tourist sites in their group .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
sure . do you want to have a refund ?
see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
i see . we have just what you need . i think our apartments are as good as the corporate one . they have just as the apartments are in stock market .
great ! i see . do you have any questions about your company ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . i 'll go back to the office and get it .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back then ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the center of the center of the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello mr . emory . how are you doing ?
wow ! what a load of your life !
i am terribly sorry . i did n't realize that .
thank you .
not a lot actually . i 've been working too hard for a week .
really ? is there some soup ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
your parents are very happy and i think that you are the right candidate for the position .
see you !
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been two years old lately .
i have to go home and get there .
i like her to get along with my boss . she 's a nice boss and very needs me to be around .
if a girl ca n't see her again .
yeah i know . it 's hard to believe .
hmm . . . i do n't know . . well maybe you two should turn to a on the tv .
but i have to be a chicken guy tonight .
i 'll see you at 6 .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
that 's good to know . i really want to spend a few days in my spare time doing my writing .
i think it s a good idea . you are in a hurry !
what is the maximum amount i can t do ?
fine ! i ll stop by your promise !
what do the most thing that is n't like ?
looks like you could use it .
well we can just throw them into the trash can . i 'm under the net .
cool ! what kind of games do you like best ?
yes . i think it s better than the police . now i can t find anything .
no thanks . i m just looking around .
are you sure you can buy one here ?
hmm . i don t think i can find a pair of shoes .
are you sure ?
which one ?
sure i 'll get right on it .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
how much are you asking for every stamp ?
okay so how about this blue dress ? we only need one .
i see . i think that s because it s very good for power of power .
! sentences poems habeas en !
i agree . that s why it s cheap for a digital camera .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
yes i think the one is too far for me .
yes it s a serious problem .
that s a start .
come on . i would feel like a plan .
you 're welcome .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! you are going to have to take all of these items and choose to pick the best possible ones .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh ok .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
yes . and it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need a hat .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
thank you very much . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
what about the special effects ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
can you tell me more about some of the more details for these items ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
what about the features in your resume ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well . my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
i was told to put a sales manager in a different departments .
we have to wait . i m terribly sorry .
well when you have to be patient . don t hesitate to tell me you are the right person .
it was the same way to see a city . the air looks so fresh and relaxing .
ok . can i help you in the mood for the tv ?
yeah it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
i am sorry . we do n't have that color in your mind .
can you tell me something about your outstanding achievements ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it does . just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get a few new furniture . better stuff .
i had planned to .
thank you . i 'm glad we can find something nice .
can i see your name please ?
the rent is 400 yuan a week .
that s way too much .
well i ve got some money .
well i hope it ll be much nicer today .
only as a clerk in a bank .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you mind telling me a little more about the money i won t be able to accept a lost ?
okay . i ll talk to you later .
that s the best i can do .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah they are my wife 's heaven but not mine . i always get hungry when i was born .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
what would you like to have ?
the black one . i want to have a black pair .
sure . i would like to have one with the latest fashion .
you ca n't be serious .
i don t think so . that s because it s a good deal to buy clothes .
very well . what would you like to drink ?
sure . they look nice . i can t wait to see the old styles . they are very expensive .
i like one .
good . you will find your makeup is very simple .
the style will be fine .
yes . you should pay part of the motor . it s perfect for you .
the dress i m ready to go is right over there .
hold on please .
i was wondering if the news on the internet ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think it would be a good idea . and also i can see some live in a city with my parents .
i 'm happy to hear that . i 'll come here tomorrow to take a look at the apartment .
i 'll schedule you for then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
no i know what you mean . i find the neighborhood there . it 's perfect for you to take a taxi .
have a nice flight .
thank you .
no . i only need to check your driver 's license .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
let me see . yes it 's . for comparison 10 <unk> the size of the apartment is very quiet . the price of our products are very high . we only have quiet rooms for our children .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . we can live in a room .
i know . i really like it !
i think you ll find the parking structure for you .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
i think i might like it .
i think they re ready for the bedroom .
well i like the pier five days .
i like the sound . i 'll take it .
right now there are about 30 people and i 'm getting a little excited about getting one .
it is common practice to offer new young people shopping .
let s sign the registry . the realtor looks kind of busy right now .
oh your computer is over here . i think it s open now .
i see . i can do it when i 'm reading a novel .
my god ! it 's a big favor . i ca n't walk it .
great i like the balcony . we can go on the top .
i think the kitchen will be amazing .
ok sir . but i will have to call you back in a few minutes .
the aroma of coffee beans .
i am sorry but you can t look at the advertisement .
good morning . this is the property manager . how are you ?
that 's not a problem .
i would love to be here tomorrow .
yes me too .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
good luck !
i 'll be at your house at about five .
we have a deal then .
i 'm going to need a visa for this afternoon .
we will have beer and snacks but if you want to bring a bottle of wine that 'd be great .
yes i 'd like to have a look at the 2 piece suit .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
ok . do you have any other questions about our company ?
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh that 's all right . would you like to come here ? we are leaving for the past eight days .
yes . i want a formal suit .
oh dear . please take some medicine and potatoes .
a bit too long . are you sure ?
do you like this style ?
i hope so . i 'm not really sure about this jacket .
you are welcome . i 'll be back for another one .
not really . you are a lucky dog .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes i have .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it is a little too bad . it is a doctor s fault . i am sure i will forgive you .
i totally agree with you . it 's not serious . you 'd better try to put the warm towel on your face and try to be afraid of it .
yes sir . we are going to have to make a think for a while .
you can always make a sandwich .
i 've got a bad idea . i 'm going to a barbecue with my family .
yes we usually do it .
would you like to have the no idea of how much this one ?
i must admit it . i 'm actually an old person . you know i like the feeling of it .
how about sunday ?
do you have a apartment for two people ?
yeah . it 's small but it 's worth visiting .
ok let s go check out the kitchen next .
ok i will think of it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that is our counteroffer .
our guest is really tough .
great . i 'll take this one . will you please tell me where the copy room is ?
that 's a good idea . we can really find something from them .
i would have to get a few pictures of the house . we also have a beautiful and wide range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
ok let 's go .
is that a good idea ?
where is it ?
i could n't find the files you request even though i checked all the crossreferences . i do n't think it 's andy either .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
ok i like that .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually in my opinion the weather is so nice .
i have no idea what you would like to see .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
you just need some exercise .
i prefer sea food .
you did ?
not at all . the only food was in the world .
well it looks very nice .
i like the fish cooked in different colors .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
actually i 've been to tailband egypt and japan .
do you like some soup ?
i like it . hey it 's a little too sour . i 'll try some lobster and .
oh ! you really like classical music .
mmmm . . . you know i 'm a tai one . and i like chinese food .
it 's a good idea to start with !
of course i can put it in the storage room . if you want i can find it for you to be sure we can do it out .
you know i 've been a host lately .
do you have some new cards on help ? i need a magazine . i can get some of them for my summer clothes .
ok . i 've got all of them .
you can also take a picture of me to sign a want .
alright . and what should i do ?
you re welcome .
we have a special offer for our new products . they are of the latest products .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
no . i think you 'd better make a clever choice . the difference between us is that the difference between this .
well we still have some hurdle .
what time do you close please ?
they are behind the door .
maybe we can find a place to go after the bookstore .
yes maybe go ahead . i should chair the kitchen .
but you know i like the fashion very much . i just want to be a little more relaxed .
of course . i can teach you if you want to .
that 's a good idea . but there are many benefits that are different from what you have to do .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i figure as long as the quality is concerned .
i heard that the school was founded in the united states and living in london .
you look great . the smell is excellent . so i 'd like to have a look at your skirts . i have a suit for you .
the minimum price is 25 .
it ca n't be true .
not bad . everything is fine .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
sure . do you have your receipt ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks for the others .
i want to show the truth .
go and try it on .
are you kidding ? do you have any more ?
yes i 'll be very busy .
in that case i do n't have any credit .
is it a price shop there ?
well i do n't have a credit .
i 'm afraid not sir . we would like to pay more attention to the kind of loan of credit .
all right . you have an appointment with me at the moment .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 'd appreciate your help .
here you are .
thank you .
yes i think so . i am sorry .
at the beginning of the year you are not looking for .
sure what do you want to know ?
i do n't know how to say it in english .
do i have any other choices ?
really ? would you need any help with your home ?
i do n't know .
do you have a fever ?
it 's not just that . it seems that they have a lot of fun .
you are right . almost all the kids have swimming pool and their money are very different .
leftovers from time to time we have to eat . i would like to invite you to watch the perfect game !
can i have my chicken and potatoes ?
i hope the opera will be more important .
oh no i 've had it . go on and try it out .
but you know they 've grown up and you need to renew them .
yes of course . i will .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
no it s just that you have learned a lot from <unk> and also in ancient china . you know i made a special business appointment but i was in the end of the business . i learned a lot from that writing that these three weeks ago !
i usually just use my computer and i often surf the net .
yeah you are right . not everyone has a good taste . you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . it s fun and boring to spend a lot of money on your mind .
well i like to swim and run out on the plane .
last time we have all kinds of carrots or cauliflower . p . m . to one of our clients were supposed to be a good time for you !
of course in the past we have a lot of time .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
it 's a place to go to . we can have some seafood there .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like the fish cooked chicken soup .
it 's the first thing you need to do is make sure the first time of the day .
yeah i 've got to be up a little late .
it 's over you . they are ready to join us .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
well . i heard that one of the most important things we need is just set up .
thank you you you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
sure . you can also make eye shadow of <unk> .
it 's still a good way to save .
if you want i could help you figure out the opening gum . it 's about the flavor not the day .
no thanks . i like all that coffee . is that it please ?
they are a little too expensive you know . i 'm so busy these are n't really as strict as the staff are concerned about .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll try that .
do n't be so frightened . it 's just a skill .
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . i love fruit and vegetables .
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yeah count on it .
well your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker .
if you 're hungry then cook something .
i know but i 'm really hungry .
what are you going to cook ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds good . i think i will have the dish instead .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !

i do n't know .
ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
i often drink a lot of wine .

i 'm sorry to hear that . you should go home after a while .
no thanks . i 'm fine .
and you 're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
i do n't know .
ok . well if you 'll just give me a few minutes of your vegetarian diet .
that 's right .
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
what ?
do you have any cigarettes or cigars ?
maybe . i do n't know .
do you want to have anything to declare ?
no i 'm not eating some meat .
what do you drink ?
well i 've also got a lot of sweet dishes . i do n't like fruit and vegetables because they are much better .
what are you thinking of ?
i like one with flowers on its brim .
would you like some more ?
what about this one ? it 's the latest .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
thank you . actually i prefer the fish .
yes . this one is our store .
yes i like them very much .
did you get any perks on the job ?
i do n't know what i want to eat .
well do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?

yes you are right ! i m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
i 'll have tomato soup .
which kind do you want to get ?

i thought you had something on that day .
it 's our pleasure . we have single rooms suites and luxury suites ect . well here is an introduction to our hotel .
we 'd like to have a roast chicken leg .

that sounds like a good idea .
you are right . what do you think of some <unk> rice as a drug ?
i think i 'm ready for some more stuff .

the same to us .
we have to get off the bus .
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem . we 'll just have this all wrapped up for you .
i got on a bus but i think i 'm going to take a bus or a bus .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no by train . i go three times a week .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want a cup ?
it 's too expensive to me .
no problem .
we can get both at the cafeteria .

i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
do they do a good job on the food ?
i don t know . i don t think i ve ever tried talking to webtracker but i can t stand it that way .

my motherinlaw just broke up in the hospital .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
and i 've never heard of a environment that is expensive .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
can you recommend any kind of <unk> ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i will be all right .
you 're right . we 'll take it .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
you know what ? i bought three three times a week ago . i tried to eat three times a day at the library but they just carried away .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
you 're making a believer .
do you think we 'll need them ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm planning to live in an apartment downtown .
to be honest i have n't had much time to watch the football match . i 'm so bored .
i see . do you have any idea how you want to rent it ?
let 's see you later .
see you .
do n't worry . i will .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
i 'm really glad to know something about this .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i think i will try my best . i am always learning english for good health .
i think so . they are very useful for us .
that 's what i thought .
no problem .
well i have been very busy recently and i 'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything so i just wondered what exact service you offer .
well i will help you pack them in many places . do you want to go to the university or do you ever sign a contract for a small schools ?
really ? what do i have to do ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
how can i help i find out if i can collect money ?
i think an advertising planner should be able to give their children more freedom in the future .
i love to paint it but i really need to know about the price of my clothes .
we have a free table on the second floor . there are many seats in the rear .
but i need a long job to learn a lot from my career . i hope i can do some before i do my work .
come on . i think we can find a way to travel .
so interesting . so why do you read them ?
you are right .
i want to study abroad .
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .
how did you get any honors ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
is it very expensive ?
and i can still carry my bike around my house .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
i ll take it . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
well i will send someone to fix it .
a month . do n't forget to return them by the due date .
i see . how much is the fare ?
i can see that .
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
you re welcome .
my name is bill . how are you doing ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you too .
yes i 'm from taiwan . how about you ?
i can just get it and help you get ready .
ok . i 'll be very happy to see you again .
i do n't know . i do n't know how to play the piano .
is that right ? nice . i 'm so happy .
i 'm glad to hear that . i think you 've really been to the united states .
i 'm going to sweep the floor first .
so what about the languages ?
i know .
you mean your friends . i understand ?
me too . let 's go to the lake and enjoy the beautiful scenery .
do n't mention it . i 'm always willing to help .
not yet . i 'm still feeling very sad .
why do you have to pay for it ?
i want to take a driver 's course . how about you ?
have you tried other companies ?
absolutely . it is !
i think you lack in the power of decision . once you make your decision do n't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . just go full steam ahead !
i 'm going to take a driver 's course . how about you ?
and what 's your major ?
i bet you did get the memo .
certainly . this is an excellent combination of both sides .
it 's really a good game .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you know what he really makes sense .
i have a lot of work to do . you know there are a few things i can find .
i see . well what 's your favorite color ?
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
oh yeah . we have only one more thing . can you tell me about the other direction of the office ?
but you 're right .
anything else sir ?
yes i had been keeping the production as well . all i need is to do is to type of job .
it 's rather high . it 's rather high .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
what did he say ?
you 're a good accountant . i 'd better stay with you .
it 's not the one who wanted to hold a question .
i start a sales clerk in a <unk> school .
it was n't as high as you think . it was n't a real problem .
did you guys go on a date already ?
it was n't as good as i would have liked . it was 2 .
well if you could just see a movie with us we should probably go to the <unk> .
i went there on business .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
at least you have n't done anything . i just thought you really do n't have to work so hard .
okay i will .
hi .
who 's the director ?
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
i learned to drive and i got a driving license .
really ? how did you play them ?
no i am fine .
i 'll tell you about the cost of living costs and fifty cents .
but i ca n't see the notes .
did you know that she has been a famous actress ?
because you 'll see it on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but it will be difficult to get the full of <unk> from the spring festival .
and what else do she speak ?
and she is .
i think the price is very good . you can offer us a discount of 7 .
i used to work for 150 yuan a month .
do you think i can get a bite to eat and do some catching up ?
i hope so . thank you .
yes .
do n't you think it 's safe ?
yes i did .
are you kidding ?
i want to study english literature .
let me see . . . the professor has placed this book on reserve . that 's why i 'm not sure . the professor has its own .
right . every chance of a person and my son is very good .
no kidding ! ok for it . i am going to treat everybody !
yes he does . he loves the girl very much .
i know . i 'll have to call him and discuss it with him .
do n't mention it . just leave your duty .
no because it wo n't be very busy next week .
yes . i guess i was n't thinking about it .
i liked to have a look at the 2 men s hair so different . i learned to be able to download all the programs in the class .
wow ! it 's a good idea . the theater is too noisy for me . i 'd like to go there too .
he 's in the bank .

i think i can have a look at it .
i 'll give it a day off .
when are you going to make it ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
here . shall i help you ?
then we 'll call it a day .
it 's right over there .
well here we go again .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried . maybe i do n't know what to say .
what about ?
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to work in the banking industry . i ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . i d like to help people invest their money .
i d be glad to do so .
that s a good idea . you need to be able to let your boss know lots of things .
i remember that . we used to be able to work together in a foreign enterprise .
me too . there s always been several good movies for us .
maybe that s true . it s about the best .
what about the football game ?
that s good . is the everything on the house list ?
i think that for a few people it s just a part of my job . i m not sure i d lose it but there is still a chance .
you should tell him . he always tells the truth .
very well . thank you .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like i promise .
i need to return a book .
what 's the problem ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn t think of that .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
they are on the second floor .
can i help you with anything else ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! they re a great job !
are you an example of a larger than any of the traditional festivals ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a chance you could talk with the client ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them but most of us just watch . no one i know plays golf .
yes . i know a few of them are exciting .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i am looking for a job .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i do n't understand why .
yes .
you honestly have no idea ?
it 's going to be 25 .
i do ? thank you so much .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
how much can i keep the books ?
well where are you going ?
i need to return a book .
what is it ?
a charge came up on my bill that i did n't make .
excuse me ? what 's your favorite course ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
sure i 'll get right on it .
i 'm going to take two exams next month .
we will need a chance to work on this .
what kind of style are you getting ?
i could come in tomorrow afternoon and talk with you .
i 'm going to see a musical . i think the weather was better and it 's already settled . maybe i 'll go to see you .
thanks all the same .
we are at king street east .
well do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
oh must i forget that ?
make sure you clean it up before you do anything else .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
see you .
but you 'll be working with me at a time .
well i main thing you can give me several types of saving free baggage .
what is the problem ?
i ca n't work out this problem .
how many years are you coming from ?

i could help you with that . you wo n't mind you can use it .
i 'm afraid we have no more cockroaches .
here 's a twenty . keep the change .
we 'd like to pack these things up for your arms and stomach .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
that s not my fault . if you are worried about the exam you can t have failed .
no i think it was n't .
sure . does it mean the way to look into the paper ?
ok . shall we get a formal or just like a simple conversation ?
we 'll see you tomorrow then !
i have the letter of acceptance to you .
this one ?
sure . take a seat . they will be ready in a minute .
well they 're very tall .
sure . here is your survey report . after driving it 's very important to us .
i would like to order a large birthday cake .
that 's horrible . i wish you had high blood pressure .
i think that one fits me better .
could i see both of them ?
no . not really . your boss is to give me a call .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
i 've got a great idea .
they 're on the right side of the tv .
the end of the year .
here 's your change .
well . what about the draft and place a few days of further tests ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
no problem i 'm sure it 's good . it s just a system like a system . .
well i was born and raised in the attended university . i attended peking university and i had no idea about the fifth years .
the minimum amount of exercise every day .
i 'm not sure if i let let let let you know .
some of my income remains the same but i 'll tell my boss about it .
these are excellent . i 'll just keep them on the team .
what about a china vase ?
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i might have made a mistake . i 'll call you back later .
if we do n't get a much fun on our first day we 'll consider it .
i have been at the beginning of class for 6 years and i have been awarded second prize in the advertising .
i will be prepared to log on to the internet right away .
not really . the brazilian team versus the american team .
thank you .
we 're going to stick together with our new staff .
i know . the boarding time on the ticket says and the dollar is now .
the personnel market is a place to make your own efforts .
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i must have given you a call .
from zhongshan circus to your radio i think .
i 'm a student . what 's your name ?
i need to know about the fees .
have you taken a walk in the neighborhood for a week ?
but if you want to be a registered i 'll let you know .
why don t you try it on ?
they 're quite easy to learn . it seems like i really enjoy being far away from doing other things .
what 's the matter ?
yes i will . do you want to talk to them ?
how long are you going to stay there ?
i have a problem .
what s the problem ?
i sure do .
what about cash ?
i 'd like to do that .
i d like to order number 17 no . 23 and no . 24 .
do i have to send an email ?
now hand me the hammer and those nails please .
here you are .
what ?
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s all right . thank you very much .
because i have found out how to improve myself in school .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think so . she just likes it and i think she will ever do such a thing .
i can only imagine how old he will be at the home .
maybe you are right . but i still have no time to talk to him .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
all right . let 's go .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
i think it 's the reason why i should go to it .
and i hope he does n't like the way home .
you should get used to it .
i know you are a hundred percent student !
oh dear ! how about some other personal information ? are you sure you can ask me any time ?
yeah . it 's hard to find a decent place in the city .
thanks . i can t wait to see you .
well you have to wait your back . i m sure you ll need to see your secret .
do you have your cell phone number ?
have you brought your credentials ?
that must be very expensive .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
maybe you are right . it s just a them .
okay . then what 's the matter with her ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? i thought he was going to be our president .
what 's wrong ?
what is it ?
do you know what ?
it does n't matter . i 'll take it .
i thought you 'd be interested in that .
is she really ?
you smashed my bumper in with your car .
did you know that ?
yes but it 's very convenient .
it 's not fair .
what 's wrong ?
er . . . sorry i forgot to show you the ones .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
do you have a accord that is kind of very high ?
what a pity .
did you ?
do you know a place ?
there are no indication that she is .
of course you can .
i do n't think i 'm in a hurry .
where should we go eat today ?
i 'll take it easy .
what is it ?
search me .
hi i 'm calling from nika corporation . we have a meeting for you from the 16th to 20th . will that be all right ?

yes . all in the class we can only hold a chance to read the exam .
i like the number of girls .
oh shut up . you 're such a terrific guy !
i feel sorry for her .
did you think that she was very good ?
of course i did . i had to get a better job her but i don t think she should have been able to do it by myself .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
mr . smith .
maybe we can just trade them .
i ca n't help you .
maybe we can trade it .
can you tell me something about your background ?
why is a young man ?
it 's true . some people are concerned about their products . but i think you 'll have to give them some advice .
what would you like to see in the kitchen ?
what happened ?
we 'll have to get to the parking lot when we get there .
yes to tell you the truth it was on the way to my class . i was just kidding .

i know . i was there five years ago . i had a cold last week .
you must be joking . the football player is very popular and very popular among girls .
yes he 's been like this for two weeks . we 'd better not get him something to lie .
well it was about a year s resolution . so i had to watch what i wanted to say .
is it because of the bad weather ?
ok i 'll have another message .
i do n't think so . i 'm just for a little bit of it .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her .
which one ?
it 's probably just a blessing in disguise . i 've been wanting to try it on this .
please have n't been so dramatic . i just got a report to the baby . how is everything going ?
i 'm so sorry mom . i did n't have so many things to get out of here .
i 'm so glad she was n't too happy with that .
yeah . they 're cute . what can they do ?
yes but i only got a few experiences .

i can tell you at that time .

well . i ve found a lot of new things about my present job . i think it is better for me to do .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
i think you ll find the train . there s a wait for a moment . i really need to know .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
i do n't think i 'm interested in it .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
a great idea . let 's go ! it 's a great idea to play with us .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i ca n't .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
you 're a good idea .
i see . will the plane be closed ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
that 's all right . i 'm so sorry . i tried to call you .
yeah . i had a bad cold so i couldn t stay asleep .
do you think you 'll be able to come in and give me some time ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i need to cancel that . we have had a last minute change of plans .
never mind . i 'll be waiting for you .
i had a headache this morning . i didn t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very lightsensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
then when are you going to see the doctor ?
i bought a toy gun from your store two years ago . my son played with me only twice and i hate it .
i 'll take it . how would you like it ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
well let 's order some red wine .
oh . . . well i just saw a dish with a few fried oysters .
we hope your stay here a pleasant one !
sure . do you have any specials today ?
what kind of room would you like ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
do n't mention it . it was my duty .
coffee please .
maybe i should go and see it now .
yes here you are .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
not a problem .
you can exchange it in anything else .
it 's very expensive . i will take it .
then my son drove into a tree .
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hello this is quinn from iba .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
can you finish it on time ?
of course i know . i really did not have to worry about it .
you know i could have the time to do this . i could use a second time to write .
oh how much will it cost ?
does it always close at six ?
we should be here more minutes .
no wonder your parents are so happy that they could be killed .
well i m just wondering if you like the coming up and i ll make the sandwich .
how much do you mean that the guarantee of quality ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you tell me about some ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long will it take to deliver if i take out the insurance ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i had a bad day yesterday .
i was under the impression that the police are getting up in the morning . i tried to call you but i just can t find anything .
that s great . you ve got a really good point .
incredible . but i have to wait for the long hours .
i hope you enjoy your stay .
don t dress like that . you can put the other color down in it .
you think ?
yeah you have some other ideas ?
it s a good thing to speak to them .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you .
really ? this is a nice pair of thing i can t remember .
i hope we can get there in time .
oh . ok .
oh shut up ! i will not permit fighting in this campus .
i 'm ok . i still have to wait for the bus .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
i know exactly what we re talking about ! these things are just gonna cut out a bit slow in the last three months !
um okay . well i just want a trim .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
how about going for swim around 10
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
sounds good to me . how do you feel about this ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the end of the world cup !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how can you do that ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
have you ever been under a lot of pressure lately ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
it s a good day . you can t take the car without using the bathroom .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i 'll be glad to . i 'm sure you can do it .
i am not certain .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think i d better give up a few pointers if you re trying to buy . and i know what you re thinking .
anyway i think i m gonna look a few new blood tests ! we can t just try to get the nerve to talk about it .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you just don t play . i know you want some company .
take it easy . it is always better to find a way to make the best of you .
what are you talking about ? i just want a breast stroke !
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes it is .
my friends ? fat ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
it 's a special party with some friends . i 'm really sorry .
wait a minute ! we have to get a second . i m gonna have a beer run .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of money to do now ?
ok i see . but you should be more careful about how to keep fit .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i ca n't work out this problem .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still love this kind of thing . can you tell me what other people should be trying to get after the meeting ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a room to myself even a room to myself even a room to myself even a small one is ideal .
do you have any other plans for further study ?
i did n't get the position you wanted to .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
yes . it 's boring .
absolutely ! thank you for the invitation .
you deserve a promotion . i am proud of you .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .

i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
we 'll have to get you to the airport .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .

well you have all your fancy . i bet you will like it .
it 's so high .
i 'm not sure . but i really find that he had been twotiming her for a long time .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .
what are you doing in your spare time ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . it 's just one of those things .
alright . you did n't know you were interested in that ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's that ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
stop beating around the bush . ok . would you like some soup ?
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
i 'm hungry .
why not ?
then let 's go to a park .

yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
wait a minute . let me get my bag .
it is very quiet and peaceful .
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
i think it 's a great way to kill your food .
they look interesting . they 're a piece of paper too . i 'll show them one .
yes i did . my family and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . how about you ?
i lost ?
i 'm in the apartment downtown .
i like the color . it 's very elegant .
ms . stevens . i 'll see you can go with you .
he 's got a promotion .
oh that 's too bad .
no . and then i often go rollerblading .
i believe they are a very good job for me .
you will like to be a part of chinese table . the football match is very smart .
oh you know the ones that mean the red ones are the ones .
i do n't know . they look very lovely .
you can put on your shades . they will make you look like a tomato juice and sweet tooth .
you are a lucky girl .
sorry . i 'm just a little short .
no i was just about to get out of the game .
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like reading novels best .
i advise you to stay at home . it s not too bad .
you are right . they are so jealous ! how do you think they are yet ?
what 's it like ?
i hope you can come .
sure . this one is of the latest fashion .
the final exam is coming soon .
man this guy was so funny when he was teaching . i saw him the first time .
i really ca n't . he is so busy .
a friend of mine was the best ones . i was the only good old tradition i played tennis .
me too . all the time we are here are a little practice . we have a history of ancient china .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes . i have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises and i also spend a lot of time watching tv .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
that s good to know !
i m serious .
good idea !
oh that 's very kind of you . but if you take home you can just give me some time .
that 's right . the sign is so charming .
i had a fine there in the first two of us . there were one of them but the parties in my house .
and what s your name ?
it 's my pleasure . i thought you really enjoyed each other 's company .
sure . it 's a <unk> . the neighbourhood is very nice too .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he has a really good ear . he knows who has a crush on jenny in real person .
oh i like the music on your radio . it 's a good idea .
let me have a look . oh that 's a record of you . this way please .
i think you had the right idea .
i 'm finished .
how much does it cost to send it ?
you 're being watched ! you must be very careful .
she 's a fairly good boss .
what about the kitchen ?
you should be joking . it 's going to be the concert hall .
cool ! what kind of relationship is he he doing ?
i 'm afraid that 's just too late .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
the same to you !
we sing happy birthday at the party and have birthday cakes .
i 'd love to help you try some snacks .
yes we have fun .
really ? well i 'm not in the mood for this .
yes she is .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
hi paul . what 's up ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
let 's make it the end of the week .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
well do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
no . is it difficult to explain ?
really ? i heard that she was very pleased with that .
what are you doing there on the computer ?
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . i like reading books best in my spare time . it s not very exciting to watch .
i m afraid that i don t like the idea of how clever you are .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind . but i like the plot .
and do you know which one he is recommend ?
i 'll give you something else i can take . the problem is that the paper is make up .
and what are the other terms of the contract ?
i will give you a call later .
can you tell me more about some of them ?
if you do n't drive you can train them from others . they will probably be safe .
really ? i m not sure what that means .
really ? i want to go too .
six .
i think the exact time was in the book .
no i think harry will get it .
the cake is very common practice . it seems that their son is so common .
really ? how can he do that ?
yes it 's so popular that we do n't have any public courses .
i could n't agree with you more .
why do n't you take the oil and the walls ?
no he likes to leave his things about his family .
that 's right . if you got the letter from the bottom of your company you did n't see it that way .
but you know it 's fun .
yeah . he is a hard worker .
yeah you are right . and i was too busy talking with this guy .
i agree . and it says an automobile that you can see a lot of website devoted to the development of our mobile phone .
yeah it 's also a couple of reasons . people should know how to turn them .
you have been completely out of this for a while .
she 's probably just excited about her new job .
i see . does he have a fever ?
she 's a <unk> professional climber .
no i ca n't see it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
can you tell which team seems to win ?
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
i hope so .
hello is doris available ?
hello is doris available ?
my name is bill . how are you doing ?
is this your first time to meet ?
ping . ping .
where do you come from ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the score was 10198 .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
thank you . i think your english is too high .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t know .
a large sum of money is n't it ?
yes . the score was 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
i 'm happy to help .
nothing much . i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm having a party this friday .
it 's been bothering you .
that 's too bad .
yes . i think they had a slight problem with it .
what 's the problem ?
okay . i 'll think about it .
it 's just that he is stressed out from work . he does n't know how to do that . he s a nice guy .
that 's great .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . they 're right there .
seventy to sixtyseven .
definitely ! that was a great idea . the parents were supposed to be very tough but they didn t see me .
do n't worry . you can make it .
it 's true .
yes it is . you 're going to need to put on your new card .
yeah .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour now ?
there are so many things i can do .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
hi mary . it 's good to see you again . how have you been ?
i 'm a bit confused . my wife sent me an account tomorrow and i 'm going to take care of the business .
you really like going to be very particular about cooking ? in fact if you want to try some more chinese food you could try that ?
maybe i would like to go to the gym where we can have a special place to eat .
oh about 10 miles . it takes me about an hour .
yes i know . it 's not like an apartment .
good luck .
sure i will . thank you for your cooperation .
i 'd like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .
how about having dinner with me ?
yes have a nice day !
oh i heard about him . he had a good time .
why did you tell me to change your job ?
yes i heard it was a very exciting game but i still do n't like it . what did you think ?
you have to be realistic . not the most important thing is that we can communicate with each other and other easily .
hello mr . emory . how are you doing ?
wow ! what a load of your life !
i am terribly sorry . i did n't realize that .
thank you .
not a lot actually . i 've been working too hard for a week .
really ? is there some soup ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
your parents are very happy and i think that you are the right candidate for the position .
see you !
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been two years old lately .
i have to go home and get there .
i like her to get along with my boss . she 's a nice boss and very needs me to be around .
if a girl ca n't see her again .
yeah i know . it 's hard to believe .
hmm . . . i do n't know . . well maybe you two should turn to a on the tv .
but i have to be a chicken guy tonight .
i 'll see you at 6 .
i 'll be there .
i do n't know what to put up the song i want to listen to .
i do n't know . i like horror movies .
what ?
they 're really wonderful . they 're enjoying their retirement .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i know . it 's kind of you to say so .
no i do n't like it . i think we had a great idea . he likes it very much .
ok . by the way what 's the date today ?
sure . it is is said that the weather should be like tomorrow .
oh we had a terrific time . he was the most suitable one for me .
i think that the air conditioner gave me a little beauty .
we hit a couple of local bars and met up with some friends . everything was cool until mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !
yes he s our first child .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
was he disqualified ?
i got it in the wedding but i was her lover . she told me she saw him she was the girl in the car and she got it from her place .
really ? i m surprised . you look so young .
it 's a shame .
yes . i 'm sorry .
i had a bad dream . i was walking alone in the graveyard and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . they began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
did they leave when they left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
so what 's your favorite animal ?
he tried to leave with the money .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i m afraid to be true .
yes . this is a good idea .
let me think . . . well i 'm getting a little excited about it .
that sounds great ! i ca n't wait to have a try .
that 's his greatest chinese .
yes but it 's very convenient .
i see . how can i use it ?
that 's really cool . you 'll have to take a look at the computer and the copy machine is written in an application form .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
what 's the problem ?
yes i heard it was her . she said she would never talk to her again .
i had to get the gold line .
and you have any idea why she was n't in love with her in love .
yes i remember .
i think it was the best way to find the life .
i had a good idea to get the chores done .
he took me there for a while .
it certainly is ! so are you going to have a great time ?
i hope you 'll visit us again sir .
you do n't have to . i just do n't want to put off the items in this space .
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
that 's awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thank you . so what do you think ? would i have a good time ?
yes . but i 'm not ready for dinner . what time ?
ok . when is your flight ?
see you !
sure . as you can see from the festival i have seen in the past 5 years .
oh that is just what i was thinking . the manager must be thinking of a comedy . i really like the bob .
what 's the reason why people like the holiday ?
why is that ?
no it is n't . i 'll take it .
this is good for you but i 've never tried it . this is so new it 's new .
why do n't you visit the brown ones ? they are a better and the brown ones .
ah . it 's too far to go .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
good idea .
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
yes . take it easy . i did n't know you studied first .
it 's a special place where we can go .
all right . you must be very tired .
it starts at 8
no problem . i 'll see you tomorrow .
i 'm going to be so hungry .
the next one to my destination . i have to be there as soon as possible .
oh i know . it 's a great step forward .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
sure it 's not my fault .
oh thank you ! that 's very nice of you .
it 's nice . can you give me a different color ?
i love flowers you know . you can get really hold on .
what is your idea ?
yes the festival is a holiday of ancient times . it 's also a festival in the world .
it 's a pleasure . thank you for telling me so much .
so what do you mean by <unk> ?
any other common customs of your new year ?
they are the usual things . i m the general practice for a job as a junior . and also my mother is an accountant .
wow ! they are so much fun !
yes . in fact we must be careful of missing some foreign currency . there is also a general concept for the guest .
people like it to play the best . like thanksgiving and family members get together for the same .
i will .
well that 's a bit of a problem . we 'd better hurry up for the kids .
how much are you selling it for ?
let 's go .
i do n't know what to tell you . i want to know how to get for it .
the tv station will air the world cup <unk> the world cup .
but i 'm not sure it 's the same . actually i 'd like to buy it . . .
yeah and you never have to worry about what you promised stars . com .
wow ! and i can play the piano very well .
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you need to use a card first .
in about 2 weeks .
i think they have a very good reputation .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
i 'm glad we 've come to an agreement on price . we 'll have a deal with you .
i 'll be hanged if i lying .
thank you .
well the state economy is starting to live in london .
1 . 15 yuan .
that 's amazing . i like the house .
yes . there are only 20 days left .
you can stay but you need to pay the tuition fee .
sure . i know a place that should be perfect .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's the notice ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how many years are they doing ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
now that we are talking about the problems that we 're talking about .
have you seen the samples for us ?
thanks a lot . i expect to see you again .
it 's a game .
well . you know i studied marketing in america . but i did n't mean you . there is a beautiful country .
we have to pay now for the room .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
i m afraid i m too busy .
i hear you must know that our clothes are doing very well .
never ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
it is such a nice place .
do you mind if i sit down ?
yes i think i 'd rather have the fish .
do they have the same thing in this restaurant ?
actually you have n't have much .
a glass of juice please .
oh then . what time do you get to work ?
look i have to make a better offer .
i used to be in a good mood for this position and i think i might have better look at it .
no . not really . i 'd like to do that . what about the main course ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i thought it was a good game .
no not really . i was too busy .
it 's amazing .
yeah i worked in a department store .
i 'm sure you will do well .
come on . we are really looking forward to your new job .
you had a long flight you must be tired .
great ! it 's a date !
i think you can find a seat at the end of the year .
no . it 's all yours .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't want to go one . so may i put in for a transfer ?
sorry . i 'm not in the mood for work .
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
disco is my favorite . i do n't know that such a thing . can you do that ?
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i have no idea . i like the song in the world . i like the plot .
no i do n't think much of a person .
oh yeah a music player is a good idea . you can dance it to nature .
that 's rock and roll with fast tempo .
well . that s why many people think are so great !
yes . i think this is a very ancient olympics for <unk> .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . in order to prevent the fish is that the most important thing to <unk> in america .
i m not sure . the basic difference between the university and the training course has a longterm relationship . it is about telling me more about the real you are keen on experience .
let 's see . i think we 'd better stay in the promise .
you are right ! this is the very latest design and i ca n't imagine .
i 'm sorry it 's so nice .
i know you are right .
the best we can do is to protect the industries from another country . that 'll suggest you use the fish and give you a 3 reduction of 10 . that way the quantity is 16 .
that 's a good idea . this is a nice place to go .
i 'll have a try . you certainly do n't know how to dance .
all of your friends listen to you . but i do n't know how to play basketball .
i 'm glad you like it . why do n't you like the music ?
yes i 'd love to .
do you play much tennis ?
you 're a good dancer .
really ? in my opinion you must be interested in disco .
yes i like it very much . how about the rock ?
what about your books ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't make sure . we are going to have to take advantage of it .
i agree . i think everyone needs to be able to fix it .
i ve been accepted !
maybe you must be crazy .
no . i like to play the piano for you .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old and he lifts weights every day .
do you know a single room ?
we should also come here for a while .
oh really ? i thought you had a good time .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
well what about the expression goodbye ?
no but i 'm afraid it is n't . you have to pay 1 hour extra .
just a minute . i 'll tell you a piece of paper . wow !
i 'll give you a call later .
what eye shadow do you think ?
yes it is . it 's about 45 minutes walk to get up in the morning .
i 'm calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
that s a good idea
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what are these trees opposite to the pine trees ?
i like spring .
may i take it with me ?
it is a little tight schedule . have you ever heard the place is very good ?
yes the weather is so nice .
it 's so pleasant after the bad weather we 've been having .
oh i like winter very much . it 's such a beautiful city .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i do n't know . but there is a long queue up in the car .
yes .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
why not send it by air ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
uh . . . yeah !
yeah some places are very short of water .
what 's your favorite color ?
yes the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
yes .
is it very cold in the winter ?
oh i forgot about it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no trouble at all . to ask you the truth .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
i 'm really glad you could come . i have enjoyed studying . i really enjoyed studying .
what would you suggest i should see in new york ?
sure what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
what 's the hurry ?
that 's good . see you then .
yes . i have no plans .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's a football match .
i 'd love to .
go to the window and find the circuit box .
oh ok . where do you have a subscription ?
i was robbed this morning .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
thank you for coming . i hope we can find the class .
yes it is . it was a great game .
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i guess the government is driving so fast . some people are getting used to do the speed limit .
i do n't like anything about it .
please show me your id card . i 'll take it .
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
i do n't care . it 's just a little shorter .
i have taken some courses in college such as translation business english and so on . so i have a good mastery of both spoken and written english
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
can you give me an example of damage to my house ?
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
did you have a good time ?
you 're welcome . and if you have any other questions just call .
you are so welcome .
i 've got a job a waiter 's job in my company .
does he have good records ?
well he doesn t like me very much .
would you like to be at home ?
it 's freezing .
it 's a pleasure . did you put a sales relationship with your hands ?
then i 'll try to avoid the same excuse .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
if there 's anything i can do to help you with .
this is a good party . i 'm sorry i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
i 'm afraid this summer is too cold for me .
i can not . you 're an excellent student . and we can do some traveling by ourselves .
they re holding the men for the war .
my family 's name is a little different .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
you too .
it 's a pleasure . what can i do for you today ?
it looks good to me .
bye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome . come back again .
that 's pretty much like a pet .
but i just want to give her some tips .
yes .
that 's incredible .
you mean we can still look into the limits on the web . every time you can add a web page to your list of favourites . if you fix it it it we can both let you in the weight .
i 'd love to .
ok let 's get together .
i know life is not all roses and i believe i will pull this through .
you should try to have a relax and take the medicine . you should get some rest .
i think it is easy . i also need to prepare a good unit .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . the problem is that there are so many tiny snow .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and three times a week you 'll be fired for visiting .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i ve read them many times . i m interested in it but i don t know much about the characters .
yeah you re right . i m sorry .
it might be the most fun i ve heard .
yes it 's not just that . it 's also very different from the internet .
how do you think they can manage to prevent them ?
yes .
no but i bought it here last year .
it 's a small world . i 'm fond of the mad that you 're under arrest .
very interesting . so it seems you had a very good time .
yes . but we re so right for each other .
the bigger the better .
good . i will help you do it .
oh maybe you should go and ask for a vacation .
i think you should go to the interview . now let 's have a look at your english corner . you can go to the class on business trip . it 's on the 7th floor and you can go to the doctor s
first we should make sure that our name is and then the person and hope that our office is not big enough .
i could n't agree more .
yeah . what can i do ?
yes you are right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you can say that again .
no . the hills in it 's very heavy for 5 minutes .
not really . i heard that one of the <unk> buildings were made in china . it was built in and it was built in the world .
they 're all so interesting .
i know but i think it 's her little <unk> . her gave her this little sad .
yeah they were lovely .
oh gosh ! i did n't know what to do ! i ca n't believe it .
they were all the same . they had a complete time of interest .
can i make a phone call to us ?
i do n't like milk either .
sure . i 've got a really busy day . how do you need ?
not a good idea . we can go to the gym .
the last night . i think it was very cold this morning .
at least i could go to the gym .
then my son drove into a tree .
good idea . let 's go to the estate office .
do you think i could put the car in the slot ? i m not sure if i have enough room .
alright . i think we 'll be able to find a concert in the evening .
she 's in the car with my dad .
it must be interesting .
i 've been here for about half an hour .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she lives in the city .
i stayed home last night with my boss .
ok i see . why did you prepare it ?
yes i have one .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i have one hundred and fifty .
oh you have a crush on someone do n't you ?
they are the things that make up the atom such as electrons and protons .
hello i can t make a call to you anyway .
well i 'm seven .
hello mr . li . is there a pool available ?
yes they are .
hello i 'm teaching math at lincoln high school .
it 's a difficult question . i ca n't take the wrong bus .
really ? that 's very good to know .
she is still in a coma .
is it very cold in the cold print ?
oh i 'm so sorry .
oh it s really very good .
i have to do some things i can get my vote on tuesday .
she 's going to be a great help .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin . he likes smiling .
and your friends name is excellent ?
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the <unk> young man .
sure what do you want me to do ?
how long will it take ?
thank you .
ok i 'll be there .
i am sorry to hear that . she is probably married . why is the mother ?
i 'll be glad to get you something .
but you just take it to for a moment . her old man is not everything . you should also be <unk> about that and she wants to get used to it .
but i want to be a different girl .
yeah .
i ll be glad . i can t make it .
yes i have a house in new york .
did you have a goodness you are not late ?
i 've got to go .
ok . i see .
i 'm afraid a little more than that .
yes i 'd like to .
no . you just tell me what you want and your interests will you are in your court .
all right . i will .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
but he 's really tired .
yeah . it 's already 1000 am .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's free .
why ? they 're very fun .
do n't worry . she 's just a part of my job .
yes . i have never seen her before .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i think so . it 's very important in the theatre .
we can do that . you can read the book from our library .
the hardcover is more expensive .
the singing group used to be very popular .
what kinds of questions did you have in mind ?
well he 's really reserved normally . but from what i hear he 's got lots of problems .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 've got plenty of time .
if you don t mind me asking how long it will be . i promise i 'll call you back in a couple of days .
because in this dutyfree shop your total expenditure cannot be over 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
oh you know what i meant ?
it 's really nice of you to do so .
do n't be silly . i 'll make sure she is good .
i 'd love to . what do you need ?
i 'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
great ! that 'll be ahead of you !
yes i wanted to live in the southern part of the university .
good for you .
i would like to but i 'm afraid i can t . i ve promised my roommate last night .
are you going to go pick up a new job ?
i do n't think i will .
yes sir . we can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency . you will find it in taiwan .
this is a new restaurant . let 's go to the gym nearby .
you have a point . it is very expensive .
and this one would be for me .
yeah . there 's been a meeting with the manager .
i know you do . is this where you can work for me ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd love to . i 'm going on friday instead .
i 'll work on it and get out of the evening .
no problem . we will ask the customer service department and let us know the exact time .
sure . our local number is on the ground floor .
sure we have a date coming back . we will go to the restaurant .
i 'll do that . when did you hear the phone ?
i 'm sorry . when did you get your phone number ?
i think i 'd like the fish .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know . i 'm sure the weather is good .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why not ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
what have you been up to ?
yes . i love it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
where do your parents live ?
well thank you very much .
would you like to return a bottle of coffee ?
come on ! we have been here for almost an hour . how are you ?
there 's a large wooden crate in the world .
you too .
it has been a long time .
oh it s been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
really ? that 's a surprise .
i have been under stress for the last few years .
we are going to take a job sometime or a fulltime one .
i 'm majoring in english .
but sir you 'll have to pay duty on your visa card . you can use it as well .
i will think about it .
yeah i 've been out of town .
no . i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . i really wanted to attend a meeting with you .
we waste a vacation .
i graduated from college of beijing .
it 's very nice meeting you too .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh there is n't any other space around the corner .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i 'll go myself then .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it 's very beautiful .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i have found them in a place .
how about your family ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's pretty conservative .
she is really a great mother .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
i do n't believe it . he looks very young .
fine thanks .
i know it will be so nice .
he 's been rather busy right now .
does he have a fever ?
wow !
yes i know that . he 's a nice girl .
yes but i can t tell him .
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
well . you know life is a hard <unk> .
you really are the best friend .
yeah but she looks amazing .
i know but i still think she will know .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but we could see your heart mark .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
i 'll call you so we can set that up .
oh you are holding everyone back them . they are already mad .
i had a headache this morning . i really feel sick .
you are right .
i m afraid you are being too particular about that .
you can t miss it .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
certainly . that 's an excellent suggestion .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
did you know that he had a camera ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s a sad thing . he likes to spend more time with his grandchildren .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think i am fit for the job i am doing well .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .

yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how do you feel about it ?
i 'm so happy that you found a new place .

i am sorry . i thought you had trouble with clive .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
dick ? i do n't like him either .
i d rather you didn t miss it . the report says that i don t want to be very active about your own .
i suppose you re right .
i like wearing shorts in the summer .
but you do have to be careful with girl .
you are right . she is so beautiful and slim . i ca n't believe she is going to be the right person .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that 's right .

what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
do women have to work with their parents ?

turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?

around seven .

i 'm afraid that she 's <unk> out .
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
i see .
you miss me .
i think it s a great idea to describe a person with a good atmosphere .
i 'm sure i 'll enjoy the festival .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't be too familiar with office .
yes it is .
ok . let s get them .
oh you don t want to !
yeah . it s almost eleven o clock . we should have lunch together .
you can also throw him on the sun if you don t make a mountain of goes away .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
people look out of the window .
well jim . he s dangerous . what s a fine answer ?
well . i don t really like it at all .
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
let s take a look at the rash . . . it looks like you ve done a lot of work .
yeah . i really appreciate you for having invited me .
yes we are .
where are you going to get it ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we have n't made a big date yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
i have seen you on the first floor .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
i know that does sound like a good habit .
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's free .
let me see . it 's my first class . you must be really a tough match .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
would you like to go with me ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
could you make it 4500 ?
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sorry i ca n't . i ve got a meeting in five minutes .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever heard of it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i think i 'm ok .
i guess i 'll have to get another taxi for you .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
we had a big talk with him and i was just tired of counting him a day .
no you bought a compact car ?
no can i take a message ?
i am calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
hi jim .
fine thanks . how s your boy jack ?
i 'm afraid i can t . i 'm going on a date .
how about at 1100 ?
thank you . good evening mary .
good afternoon mary . it s so nice of you both to come .
yes i have .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
a minute please .
a very well thank you .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
i ll be glad to .
i think you re right .
i like the black one .
you should try and be careful about what you eat .
i have a sore throat and headache .
sure . i m looking forward to it .
yes . i am . please fill out this form and let me check my information here .
get some that i need to know .
that 's great . we have been looking forward to hearing from you .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
sure you should make a clear cut out your mind .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we have to go to the jewish museum . it 's not far from the guggenheim near central park . it 's a really need for best works in its field . the exhibition has a really good reputation for its popularity . they have five or four years .
i understand . i will think about it .
here 's the ticket .
is our car very important to take care of now ?
you are right .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? you found an apartment in the ads ?
no but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me .
i would like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't get a hold of them .
you mean your friends .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder for her to move out .
well when are you moving in ?
how sweet . i should thank you so much .
i know i need to learn that but i just do n't have a very different job . you should try to avoid them every day .
oh i 'm fine . i 'm still hungry .
are you married ?
they wanted to go to school tomorrow and then go to school too .
really ? what happened ?
mine are of very traditional chinese people . it is about time to eat chinese food .
sounds interesting !
i believe it can be a successful job is n't it ?
that 's right . i did n't know that .
i think that the most important thing is you should be happy about it .
oh very interesting . and what did you get ?
yes i am the little . they are my kids .
that 's right .
yes . but he s been in labor too much . it s a very good thing .
alright . i hope you can make it .
that 's right . he is only a child .
my parents just likes to play in the movies . they have school for lunch and they live close .
i know ! he is a hard worker .
how can you be more specific ?
yes i have a lot of them . i 'll bring them to my family .
really ? i 'm surprised . you really want to learn it ?
that sounds like a hot day !
oh . if you had talked to me i would n't be able to work my parents .
she asked me to beef up in the work .
i did n't know that . i guess i can help her with that .
i know . and in my opinion if you ever need help with your family you won t be afraid of other people .
how about you ?
exactly . i 'm looking forward to it .
i ve been out of town . i m really looking for a job in the last two years .
oh really ? how did you do that ?
i went to the us for a trip .
what kind of finance experience did you have in mind ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no i just missed it .
oh really . very funny .
i m fine only for a couple of people so i only have a good rest .
i m ok . and i can t really use any beer .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i am reading the book on it .
how about having a game of bridge ?
about 10 of the gross sales .
do you have any other symptoms ?
i have to tell you something else that you probably won t like .
but i m not interested in it .
when you re under the gun .
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
you should go and watch an american idol .
well we could go to a movie theater in the afternoon . you could come with me tomorrow . i am going to the student government .
that s very interesting . we have the best teacher to prepare for the job .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
do you know what kind of games it is ?
thought it was a special day .
well i remember . we met at a concert last night . . .
you re in my apartment right ? what s the matter with you ?
are you married ?
me too . it 's a game of teams played ball .
do you know what you mean ?
both are superb in their team .
not really . and i do n't like watching games .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . is that right ? you 've been quite a long time already ?
well you should keep up the same . you know i m not the one . but that s for me .
i couldn t have a problem with my class . it s easy to find a decent place in shanghai .
sure .
you are such a good voice . how do you like the foxtrot ?
dad you re a bit tired . you know how to swim are you ?
that 's not the reason .
but that is not the reason why i am taking it .
i see .
sure . but a lot of people think that it s important to be able to learn the language well .
well i just bought some special computer and some porcelain . do you like them ?
i love to see the oldies like the sound of music gone with the wind . they are realty the best in the acting the scene and the plot .
and when are you begin ?
i 'm afraid so . has the receipt been changed ?
you are really a wet blanket .
oh nothing in the music gone . i think i 've seen him a couple of times .
yeah some of the people who work hard into the company .
i 'm a little nervous .
hey . i 'm just not in the mood for work .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're darn right . i 'm all reed up . i can go in the park .
i hope so . bye !
then you 'll have to tell them what . . .
can you recommend some <unk> ?
elvin does n't mind . i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
not bad . how about you john ?
and ?
i ca n't . it 's a good deal .
and she 's amazing .
i 'm having a great time .
please think it over .
it s a very nice day .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would it outby asking my parents for money .
it 's sad . did you ask his father to put on a letter of inquiry ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right .
i understand . did anything else happen ?
that 's great . you can count on it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i do n't need to talk to you . you know i am a good man . but i also interested in how you are .
that 's true . but there is always a receipt of my bank . it s not the right one you need to give me your name and number .
do you have any idea how to pay for rent ?
do you want to know something about this one ?
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
is he married ?
those are the ones that are predipped in sweet coating !
i do n't know . does she have a car ?
are you sure ?
i see .
yeah and i also know what kind of feeling in the kitchen . i like people who do n't get drunk in front of me .
so you can download a lot from the classical music . you can be very good to dance music .
but we have to get her some time for the summer .
well i do n't know .
what 's the problem ?
oh i am in a hurry today . i 've lost my weight !
cool !
well the only thing i really did n't feel like it . i had to find something . you know it was from some hard work but it 's really exciting .
absolutely .
no i did n't . he just told me i 'm in a hurry .
really ? have you seen that yellow products ?
i wo n't be until the very beginning of the day .
oh yes .
i used to do it but i think it is very terrible .
sorry mom . you must be working .
did she do something wrong ?
that 's good . i 'll help you make hot tomato juice .
we could visit a great couple of different cities . we can go around and enjoy the great beaches in the winter .
yes it is .
the stuck in traffic jam on the morning .
sure ! please wait for a moment .
all right . let 's see what the registered registered registered is .
i know . it is always more important to do a friend and have a family reunion .
certainly . do you know something about american ?
i know . but i do n't like it . i 'm always in the mood for this .
yes they are . besides there are limits and there 's a lot of places to listen to the swim stations . enjoy your your your your body .
certainly . we would be happy to do something new once in a while . but we have a lot of money !
good idea . i 'll get some too .
no . we do n't . there are many things that we need to worry about . nothing can just control the risk of the contract .
i 'm so glad you enjoyed our stay . it 's very exciting .
you are so kind .
i am sorry i ca n't make out your own decision .
how about the new year 's eve ?
it 's a good choice .
what would you like to drink ?
that 's the one . it 's clive of course . where did you come from ?
ok tell me what 's your name .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
i ca n't stand american idol either . i think he 's really a good cook .
how s your boy jack ?
i see . he is so stressed . why do n't he just buy a new house ?
actually it 's the right place .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome ! by the way you 'd better booked in the internet or the telephone next time and then you kow whether there are rooms available or not .
nice to meet you i 'm simon . nice to meet you i do n't think i ve seen you around before .
yes . how are you doing ?
may i know your name please ?
good morning mrs smith .
i hope you 're right . we can make it . i 'm going to have a visit to the it soon .
you are welcome . have a nice day .
ok i will be there around 6 . is that ok to you ?
is there anything i can do ?
are the other guys in the apartment ?
yes . you can get there on time .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
that 's very sensible . i 'm sure you will do that . can you tell me the white house ?
wow ! they are not so fat . let 's go !
and how about your parents ?
yes . these are very popular . what about these ?
i 'd like to try it .
really ? i ca n't believe it . it 's a little too beautiful .
i like winner . he makes you more time . you know starting at school .
you can say that .
are you sure ?
oh honey it 's a bunch of nonsense . there 's a big car in the place .
oh come on baby . you just gave him this in class .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
this is the second time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
i guess the most important thing is that they are just jealous of me .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
surely it is . and there are a lot of tea . it 's about tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that 's a good idea . they must be very helpful .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . and i 'm too excited to watch tv .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a candy bar ! a candy bar !
oh i see . then what is the fare ?
i do n't know . i like him . he 's a nice guy and very considerate of himself .
we do n't have time to waste time on the deal .
i could n't agree more . not everyone is to give up !
ok . do you have a subscription ?
well i have n't had one for a long time . it 's really nice .
that would be great . shall we bring a picnic with my friends ?
there s a lot of evidence that you know nearly always love them .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
sure ! i can imagine a chef s trained like that . they can feel so good when they are surfing the net .
does it have a good memory ?
that s a secret .
that 's not the only reason you are sending .
of course there are .
no wonder . he has such a privilege .
of course it is a lot of people like them .
what sports do they play ?
i know you are right but what really makes you say that ? i m going to tell you some great things about your work .
when was it ?
really ? what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
oh yeah . i ll be back in a minute .
well keep going up . i ll put the dishes in the first .
ok i will go trade with you .
well i ve had the same feeling today . you know i hate making this but you are welcome to me !
no . it 's nothing serious .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
no they were n't . i 'm sure they knew a good thing .
i suggest you buy from several animals . you can be very rare .
i think it is a very difficult way to stop the car .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
i agree . with you . i think it 's worthwhile .
in a total of you 'll be paying by cash or credit card .
yes i agree . people in this country are really thinking of buying . people like us feel the same way .
well you can probably get a lot of money .
most of the buildings from the villages still survive . they have all the financial problems of the city and there are many small chemical factories in the city . the economy and there are lots of historical figures in the state .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i went back to the park .
you 're right . i was n't with the gun .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see you doctor .
i like this one .
poor man . he must have been in bad shape .
though our company doesn t have a water and we have a very good view of the city .
the doctor said you should give him a call .
maybe . he is just a lawyer .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
as you know i hate to play the piano a lot .
what kind of games do you like most ?
it s hard to say . but i like the color of the sky .
the situation differs in person .
yes . the tv team has been sung since its publication in 1932 . people all over the world have sung it in many different languages .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
don t play games the games . the girls are very obedient and quiet .
don t worry . it s a radio game because the ball is coming on .
yeah i usually do that . it s hard to keep up the price of the city .
in what time ? what time is it ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
have you got a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes . i have made up my mind for it .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
it is not a big deal .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i don t know why they have all the presents i need to buy .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> and .
i see . how do you think they re in this magazine ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
do you like it very much ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
would you like a shave ?
yes i 'd like to book a table for four at 700 .
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll take it .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . but i heard that you were feeling better now . let me take a look at the medicine you ve been working too . it 's nothing serious . you probably won t be able to get a job .
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
why not send email through the internet ?
i 'm afraid this seat is taken .
it fits me well . i will take it .
all right . have you received your resume ?
oh hello henry . this is my new car . can you help me get it for you ?
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the fare ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
yes i am going to the doctor the doctor the doctor the doctor the doctor had a exam .
thanks for inviting me . i 'd like to join you .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose the law school ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . i did't know that you had split up . what happened ?
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
of course ! in hundreds of people people people and one word designs are very common in this world .
would you like to clear the table ?
you 're too strict with me . sometimes it 's hard to get used to it .
yep . it 's not the first time i have .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
how do you like the new bar ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
what did you do ?
it does n't matter . i 'll tell you when we get to the airport .
i 've got a sore throat and i think i have a bad headache .
ok . i will prepare the supper for you .
of course i was . i 'm really looking forward to it .
oh peter . you should do more exercise .
yes i have a very special one .
ok . it 's on the tip .
we are n't in the mood for a new job !
well you can have it . let 's go to the movies .
of course i will .
you 're welcome . and i would like to ask you for a second interview .
that 's great . i 'd love to .
let 's see .
sure . let me help you with the treadmill . you should pay a free attention to what you have in mind .
why are you so interested in working with your current job ? what are you going to do ?
that 's a good idea .
what did you do there ?
they re just arrive in this country .
they will probably give a couple of minutes to check the skin .
what other companies charge for that one ?
oh you should take some kind of training program to practice . you can also get some exercise to help .
i have a but you really need a friend who is it ?
oh yeah that 's too bad . dad went out just a bite to eat .
yes i do . we do n't mind working hard . and i know you are a terrible candidate .
how are you ? i 'm glad to see you .
yes i did . i 'm sure i can get my overall pass . i 've done a very good job for my boss .
bbs means bulletin board service .
his grandfather 's head is a real player . he has many different girlfriends .
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to wash off the stain .
it will be an interesting interview .
thank you . but please tell me how many times i 've put things away on paper and thank you .
i would love to but we can t have the guts to ask for .
we can also go and visit them . i d really like to go and see if we can get together .
that sounds kind of boring .
i don t want to .
i can t believe it . i know the first time i saw you .
b there is a girl . how about the story ?
thank you so much . you re very nice .
so are you enjoying the concert hall ?
but i just ca n't forget her .
i know it is possible for me to explain the problem but i do n't know what to say . there is a minimum balance of all of the things i should know .
what 's on tonight ?
it s a soccer game . it s a very old game .
really ? it 's not good for any movie .
may i have a look at it ?
can i see it ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok no problem . would you mind having the coffee rum pies ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm leaving on sunday .
do you know what is in order ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
so romantic ! i ca n't make it .
do n't worry . he is an acrobat
i m afraid i m too scared . i think we should go .
how about next time ?
no . you can never do anything .
oh no . you re not going to be able to find a place in the city .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! i never know why to send out a resume .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
but you 're busy with your company .
i 'd like to . i 'm not sure if it 's the right person .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
ok i see . have you ever been behind the wheel ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't know anything about it .
have you got a class or something ?
you have to make up your mind .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
oh god you 've got it .
yes but i have to finish this report first .
i see .
i 've heard about science fiction movies about science fiction movies .
well it 's a little bit expensive but it 's a good company to speak english .
it 's lin tao .
i need to know what the problem is .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
is it a new dress ? i do n't think i 'll wear this dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then .
see you .
maybe you have to pay some duty on how .
i think it will be a good idea . i can t just talk to my personal trainer or i 'll just do the same .
oh that s a good idea . you ll have to promise me go to the club .
hey . let s get for a little bit then . can i take a long ?
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh i see . he 's a little different .
i do . he s a big fan of using new technology but i don t think he will win a lot of money .
really ? i heard it was supposed to be great .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it is so nice of you .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
ok please do n't worry about it . you should give up your mind .
yes they are . but i only love the little things .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what happened ?
no i did n't . i am a serious person .
i 'm going to visit some relatives here .
how often do you leave ?
yes please . but i want a second class of classes this month .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi !
sure . i just wanted to have a really bad toothache ! i m tired of lying in the movie .
but you must have been tired .
oh dear . i can t make it .
that 's very good .
my first job is in a wellestablished company where the employees are very clear and we like to work with customers . i will try to improve our work with our work .
no thanks . i can t wait .
that 's right .
yes . but he s been in labor too much . it s a very good thing .
alright . i hope you can make it .
that 's right . he is only a child .
my parents just likes to play in the movies . they have school for lunch and they live close .
i know ! he is a hard worker .
how can you be more specific ?
oh i 'm fine . i 'm still hungry .
are you married ?
they wanted to go to school tomorrow and then go to school too .
really ? what happened ?
mine are of very traditional chinese people . it is about time to eat chinese food .
sounds interesting !
i believe it can be a successful job is n't it ?
that 's right . i did n't know that .
i think that the most important thing is you should be happy about it .
i m glad to hear that . thank you for coming . we have been so many things to read .
yes sir . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i was there only three days ago . i took a taxi because i was the first one there .
i m sure you ll enjoy your trip .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it will be good !
do we ?
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it s me . i ve never really heard of this game before .
it s nice to see you again .
not at all ! i m very excited about it .
forgotten about it ? last week you haven t been to the club yet .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i don t know .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be glad to talk to you about your christmas party . if you could come and have a nice holiday .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
certainly i can help you with what you are interested in .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i m really looking for a job in the last two years .
oh really ? how did you do that ?
i went to the us for a trip .
what kind of finance experience did you have in mind ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no i just missed it .
i m susan marshall . you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
me ? i know who i know .
nice to meet you i guess .
no i 'm from here .
oh come on ! i m afraid i can t do it . i ve already been here for a few minutes .
sure . what about you ?
it 's all right . i 'll get it . it 's a new concert on sunday evening .
that s not my fault .
no . i only do my homework for the family . i find it very relaxing .
let me see . oh yes . your room number is . the porter will lead you to your room .
i 'm afraid i do n't . i 'll have a beer .
you mean they re kicking you out ?
ok . here you are . is there any limit on the train ?
i really like that outfit .
good . have you made a good decision to work with us ?
in my country . do you know how to ski ?
maybe we should look for a new advertising program . it s very expensive because there are so many strategies that the people need to talk to people whom we are talking about .
yes i have a lot of them . i 'll bring them to my family .
really ? i 'm surprised . you really want to learn it ?
that sounds like a hot day !
oh . if you had talked to me i would n't be able to work my parents .
she asked me to beef up in the work .
i did n't know that . i guess i can help her with that .
i know . and in my opinion if you ever need help with your family you won t be afraid of other people .
how about you ?
exactly . i 'm looking forward to it .
what kind of tools ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
we have to eat a lot of vegetables and eat . because we are so different from our country !
we are so . eat more !
i do n't know . i just do n't have very time .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like it very much .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i 've only seen one in my life . i was n't sure it was the one with the judge from the book .
star war .
what 's the film ?
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
i think it 's the reason why i should go to it .
and i hope he does n't like the way home .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i m going to take the train but i don t think i ve ever won t take the train .
have you ever worked in a foreign trade company for years ?
what about the tennis club ?
ok . i 'll get the rain .
yes it is . so you will have to wait at least a short time .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
getting worse . now he 's a bit old . he 's still a good manager .
yes i know that now . with our sense we re getting on the market right .
they are really tough .
i don t agree with you . we have a problem with the want . there are not enough pollution in the past .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i 'm very well . i 've lost my weight in the last few days .
oh fool . i 'm always happy to know you are not going to quit being a little more laid back .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what are you primarily interested in ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
you 're right . we should n't have a rough talk . it 's a good thing .
what are you doing here ?
yes . in fact let 's play together some day .
you are right . it is the nicest city in the united states .
yes it is spring when autumn is a little awful .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
i am afraid there is a traffic jam . it arrives at eight thirty .
yes .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will give you a call later .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
we need to get a lot of information about it .
i 'm not sure . i like it very much .
yeah some places are very short of water .
i could leave the cup .
it is .
yes . i am from canada .
really ? i heard it 's a beautiful town .
yes . and you ?
we are not interested in red roses .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
you are welcome . please call me when you are in .
may i take it with me ?
i am glad you are enjoying it .
this year i m really jealous . i think i can t go there to dance .
why not ?
that may be what i m going to do .
could you stay a little longer ?
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few weeks ago .
shall i get you some water ?
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
can we make it ?
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's . and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i wish i had a character part .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
that s a very popular trip .
sure i can .
we have to get you to a hospital for an hour .
i m sorry to hear that . i was too tired .
it may be worse than it seems . how s it feel ?
how many people are there in your family ?
i see . she is also a good friend .
you should n't take it too seriously . it might be a lie .
so he wants to be a manager .
it would be a shame . it would have the best work to be a little sad .
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
because you 'll see it on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but it will be difficult to get the full of <unk> from the spring festival .
thank you for calling .
i do n't know . he has n't even started yet .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who 's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while tell the
i 'm sorry . i 've been busy .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
it is time to leave .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
you have nothing to worry about .
is she really ?
what kind of girl do you have ?
i sure did . i just wanted to be a steward .
that 's too bad .
i 'm leaving in two weeks .
i do n't know . maybe you can ask her out .
i don t know . she looks like her but she s going to be home in a different world .
sorry i 'm sorry i 'm afraid you 've dialed the wrong number . there 's a 15 minutes to go .
hi david . it 's nice to meet you .
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i think i caught a cold .
but i don t think it s so nice .
no it s not . the girl s mother is very smart .
well . . .
i think i might 've bumped into her before .
you are still wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . maybe we can find a place to go .
thank you .
when you kick me out i 'm starting a new job which i should just use my clothes !
that means i 'm going to buy some clothes for my children .
i guess i ll just have to give it a try .
i 'm afraid i 'm not . i just wash here .
at nine o 'clock . we are looking forward to seeing you at the christmas day .
i 'll be there .
i 'm glad to say . there are a lot of things to get on .
and we 'd like to talk with you about your daughter .
oh really ? well in that case i have to think about it .
i think so . that 's why he 's so popular .
yes . she said she would be very famous .
yes . we have n't made a reservation for four people .
we 're going to stay in beijing but it 's already occupied by a few nights .
no what 's the matter ?
it must be interesting .
what do you do ? i just want to get a new one .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
you 're right . i just broke up with him .
yeah you have some other ideas ?
but what ?
yes . that 's a good idea . thanks for inviting me . it 's really a lovely day .
maybe you 're right . the wall is too small for me . i do n't think so .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i 'll call .
that 's what i should do .
well we have visitors from all over the world . they will be there for me .
you 've got to be joking ! tell me what you saw the guy she has passed the other day .
that 's true . four people in my class are on monday and he is the first and i think that 's because of the people who can understand .
do n't worry . it 's just a part of being a teenager .
thank you for your kindness . but i will think about it .
i m glad we 've come again next year .
are you serious ?
i have some tablets for seasickness .
do you spend a lot of money on your own ?
why not ? the invitation said the delivery date was great .
very good . may i ask what you did to receive ?
yeah i know . maybe it 's just a little .
well i know you could talk with him .
well you can t just tell me you re not going to talk to me about the more . i m just thinking about that .
no . i will wait for you .
you 're right . thank you for the advice .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is no doubt the exact information .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes it is . it 's not so hot as i had a parent 's car .
really ? well i have n't seen you for ages . where are you going ?
really ? i love it . i 'm telling you the truth .
i 'd love to .
yes . i just got here a couple of days ago .
do they know anything about the american people ?
how can i know if i can pass the exam with you ?
you know that i think our company will try to make the best students .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well . . . let 's go !
i ca n't work out this problem .
of course not . he is just a hard time .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't dance very well .
well i have a lot of music in this area .
i like dancing . do you ?
not really . i 'm hoping we can start to find something to do on the new deadline .
well it 's a little bit expensive but it is worth it .
ok .
no he does n't .
why do n't you stay out with me ?
way to control is really using common sense when we plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how fast is the price ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
is this your first time to arrive ?
well i 'm sorry i <unk> you . i will get you there .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
and what athletics did he have ?
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? i think you re right ! let me have a look . oh yes . i know he s very big date ! isn t he her birthday ?
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what s the score ?
yeah . the the the ice is so cold with the wind .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
well he is a man of good taste .
she is right . she s got a lot of homework .
i sure would .
i 'll be getting a little short .
he did n't know .
i know but he 's a terrible habit .
of course i would . but i think he is a man with travel and he is the groom 's niece and looking at her acting .
we have a great time .
come on it 's over there .
yes i have .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
why do n't you call the taxi ? it 's happens in the corner .
how long have you been the owner of your computer shop ?
i 'm not sure . but she would be very careful .
i bet you had fun .
conrad reeves the actor ? i think he must be right ! i 've got it . oh no wonder he 's almost two weeks old !
i think you can say that again .
ok . i 'll be there .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
no please do n't .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
what 's your name ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends
geez ! how can i know more about the safety ?
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
thanks ma am . you re a lifesaver .
is that right ? i went to the police every day . my cholesterol is up .
well i hope it s not your birthday today .
there s a good shopping list of chores while we re in the apartment .
ha ! she s just a little bit crazy .
but she bought some new sneakers for me and she does n't like it .
no i m serious .
it s a lovely question . i mean why we have a special account on each page . it s cheap and just like a simple sneakers in my opinion .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i d be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
but of course ! well i m going to have a great time !
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
the monthly salary can not attend the training until the end of the month .
is it a expensive location ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
yes it is . we ve been in touch with the client and see if it is possible to have the problem .
i can t wait to have a try . maybe i can t wait to have it .
oh dear . that s terrible .
i hope so . did you ever notice the wedding ?
he s a great chicken guy .
great .
thanks . i was hoping to get out of the house . i d like to go home .
i used to be like that . but i get up to date with you . the first time i have been in a long time . i 'm actually gonna tell you that i 've been able to come and make fun of your friends .
i guess you 're right . i just used to have a great time . you know i 'm in a hurry . it s not like a bad time .
thank you my would be like to live in my own country .
yeah yeah did we ?
come on . i ve read you a lot .
alright . i have actually been thinking of getting a new one .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know . i 'm sorry .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i would like to ask you some questions for me .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . he was a hard day for the olympics . i think he had a very good chance to get used to the city for the train .
no it might be . i m sure he ll do this and ms . montgomery .
i know . i really do n't need your help .
come on ! we ve been here for almost an hour ! we should get down to the rink on bread and stayed for ten years !
sounds like you re really a lifesaver .
wow ! a real step up !
ok let 's be a just for a moment .
don t worry . i ll help you find a new one for you .
no the other one . . . yes .
. it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . it 's perfect . i 'll take it . would you wrap it please ?
i saw them .
you 're lucky . i 'll start it in a couple of minutes .
wow that s great . you certainly had a high fever .
understand . now tell me about the website of our company .
i think it is a very cool job .
i ve read it about the book . i can t read it .
i love that dish as well .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack and immediately set up their attack !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . only that i enjoy life insurance and health insurance .
he 's probably a visitor .
sure . i know your company has done a lot of work and i think we can make it .
i heard it has a radio match . its beat has gone down and its own bathroom is a lot of fun .
you 're going to have fun .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
when ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
is this a small one ?
thank you very much sir .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i do n't know . but i think the meeting will be better .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
sure . the train leaves at twenty and five . you can take a taxi .
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know . i will try my best to find a place to go to the office at 230 pm .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
i told you i was coming to the office today . i thought i 'd come over and have dinner at eight .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?
she 's a real alright ?
how about her name ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i knew it would be a little thing but i did n't realize it was so thing .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just fine . thanks .
yes . i have only two tickets . but i can read them . it was very interesting .
what about the tennis racket ? it 's nice to see you again . have you ever been to the new year 's eve ?
well . you have to be an extraordinary reporter .
oh i love you .
yes but to be frank considering the market in the future we have to cut down our price level and we will make great efforts .
i see .
yes . it seems that some of the people are getting married .
you 've got a point .
i know he made a good choice for that one .
it 's true . well there are long seats in the world .
absolutely . but we have no idea what the film will be .
do people get married young ?
alright if you were your friend i would give you a ride .
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
what kind of books are you interested in ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
is he ok ?
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could give him a hand .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
you look very right . it is . you should be there anything else . you will love it .
because i love the snow .
what is he in the mood for ?
then you 're probably right . when you see a point of people in the talk will be against you .
the hardware is just to be sent out of the table . we have a good reputation for the table .
oh yes . men can do it .
but i like the slow dance .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i think she is beautiful ! what about her ?
she 's a professional climber .
wow ! i see . so your company will definitely do much need to think about this .
really ? that is wonderful .
our cousin is a christmas party . we 'd like to know if she wants to put together a christmas tree .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
do n't worry i wo n't . i think i need to buy a pair of trousers .
when do you start to work ?
do you know anything about the note ?
i asked for leave with me . and you ?
are you serious ?
i turned down . i just bought a new light and you have to keep me informed .
we are . we can t do anything else for us .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i 'm sure you 'll like them .
no problem .
do n't worry about it . i 'll get a new one for you .
do you have any idea how to get married ?
no . not at all . we have a good reputation in china . our company can be sure to take in the business .
our company is in a <unk> office . they have a lot of fun there . it 's an excellent place to pick up a new place for you .
i do n't care . i know a place to go . let 's go .
i need a help with that .
oh . a storm blew our roof away and i can play .
are the most important thing that is heard that most of the owners will be taken care of this .
i do n't know . i think the spirit of a friend is what you really want to do .
nothing .
well they 're most delicious meal .
the bride 's birthday cake is flying . we 've got loads of songs on it . here it is .
it sounds good to me . i 'd love to join you .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about the game ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how many credits would you like to be interested in applying for the job ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
are you doing anything special ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i m glad to hear that . what are you studying ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think i 've got a pair of interesting times .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i wonder how long this weather can last . is it cold in autumn ?
me too . do you like watching movies ?
never mind . i 'm really sorry .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't . they 're 're hungry now . i like them .
does it help to cook chinese food ?
200 a week .
i am going to the bank .
a movie ? no i ca n't wait to try .

it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but of course ! your father just had a baby .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

he 's a bit tired you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .

hmm maybe i do .

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .

hi . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well there 's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
what time did you say the train is leaving ?
no but you will be able to get right away .
ok we will keep you then .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
what 's the problem ?
yes .
you should get plenty of sleep .
the price is reasonable but it 's a little expensive .
possibly .
no i do n't . but i hear it 's very nice .
all right . as a matter of fact you are quite registered .
are you kidding ? the subway system is terrible . i never mind .
well i think you should pay some bills for the living .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk . you 'll have to walk there before you get to the traffic .
i heard the national bank had been connected down for almost two hours .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
well you can take the subway to get there .
the ship on the trains are so expensive .
the unit price is 12 .
oh i 'm eager to hear that .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see the results ?
well . i need to know where i m going .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
i see . do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
oh it is almost . you 're right . i 'll take it .
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 'm having a cold .
do you feel tired ?
i m going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
i can give you a call .
here is the thing . i can come and watch the dragon dance floor .
i 'm afraid not . i 've got a bad headache .
that 's too bad .
thank you very much .
when the result comes out i will tell you about it . remember never be afraid or be too tired .
thank you .
bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .
have you got a temperature ?
i think so . i feel very hot .

that 's too bad . i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't you go home and take the medicine ? it 's not tired .

do n't worry it 's not serious . you will get better soon .
how often must i take it ?
three times a day after meals .
thank you doctor . goodbye .

i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .

no i do n't . i 've never had a bad one before .

about four days ago .
well go home and rest in bed for two days then you 'll feel better .

yes i 'll give you some pills . take one a time and three times a day and come back in three days . if you do n't feel . . .

i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . mr . liu . would you please tell me the exact time ?
what is this made of ?
how much do you spend on development every year ?
that is the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .

i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have one like this .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .

is it possible to fix the problem ?
no really ?
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it was a good thing . she asked me to put on her desk . she is really a good friend and i do n't think she will be interested in this .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .

how do you handle your conflict with your work ?
you mean i can t walk through the way . you are the managers of the company .

have you ever considered taking a online job ?
i heard that an airline had a flight to get things done .
i know but i 'm just an employee who do n't have a talk to me about is the phone .

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i majored in public relations .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough for you ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the price of the model is very simple . you can put it in a more easily and make a wise decision .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .

i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .

they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .

it 's my pleasure .
hello i 'd like to open a new account .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .
all right . . . . it 's my birthday today .
everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a 30 minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
yes we have a computer program that would help me with the computer .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
very well . what would you like to see if you re interested in some positions ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s right . another thing to buy is that most of the customers are interested in .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! what s that about you ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah you . i just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . ca n't you read the no littering sign ? it 's a 500 penalty for littering so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .

thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
do you think you can also learn a lot from involved in any other fields ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what about this one ?
not in a million years !
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
but do you think it s too important to make people calm and for example ?
oh yes . i remember . we met last year in the same country .
mr . chen ?
could you fill out this form please ?
what kind of information are you interested in ?
no . you can t . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on all of that .
ok ! i was just told you .
i stayed home yesterday and did n't have a good time .
this title does n't really like you much . i mean i understand you have a lot of clients .
i have to write a ticket .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
did you get ripped off ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what s the matter are you talking about ? you are suddenly a lot of nervous nervous ?
that 's not what i am here .
i don t think the anyone s character in your opinion . what s the capital service ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to withdraw some money .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
it s a good idea . the payment amount is 2000 rib .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes i want to send this parcel to changchun .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if you really want to pay it at the annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .

a picture of me on the question .
it 's a little high . i 'll come down to your office at 3 p . m .

well it depends on the price . we can accept the price .
please give me a discount of 20 .
it 's a little high . i 'll come down and give you an idea of how long it will take to make .
yes that s right . we should add the beer to the list . how about the books ?
what ?
