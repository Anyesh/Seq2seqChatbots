i would like to check in .
how did your husband 's son ?
i am perfect for my help .
try a singer . it has lime juice and over ice .
i 'm afraid we have some on your mind .
an ordinary one we have a fair price of 12 . 50 for our skirts it goes well with a complexion .
your total comes to 7 .
i think that one fits you . what 's the price ?
that is very kind of you .
of course . it s on the arm now .
sure . it 's on the 7th floor .
is the price negotiable ?
one thousand .
i 'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings .
would you like some ice cream ?

is this to go or to eat here ?
can i also get extra souvenirs in the supermarket ?
yes you can . we need a few things for the picnic right away .

ok i 'll have apple pie with ice cream .
yes i 'll have a glass of mineral water .
how would you like your coffee ?
no but i need it tomorrow morning .

well . first i do n't think we have enough time to steam the city . there 's a certain way you know .
could i reserve a table for saturday september 16th at 8 00 p . m . ?
i 'm mr . johnson .
what brand ?
oh no .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
do you like olives ? or would you prefer crisps ?
thank you .
well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
oh it 's too expensive . ca n't you make it any cheaper ?
thank you .
sure . . .
oh yes . i was n't there .
sure . but we can make a bet there is an interesting one .
sure . i think it 's enough for people to stop getting away from live with nature .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
and have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it was n't that loud .
i need to help you .
i 'll wait .
hi .
what s so great about it ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
all right . i 'll send a larger to see it .
maybe you can find a parttime job or a small one .
i will . thanks for your help .
i 'm sorry . but it 's not allowed .
thank you . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes you have a camera .

i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
yes . your light and full coverage will be three .
how many nights a week is it ?
let me see . . . it 's a secret .
can i pay by card ?
i can try at the moment .
it was n't that loud .
i need to help you .
ok . well after you dial 9 on the keypad you should hear the tone change .
thanks very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
sure . here you are .
i 'd like to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?
well . we recommend going to be happy with our special sauce . it 's quite popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a different view of different rooms .
it 's not very cheap . i think it 's better to get used to it .
orange juice please .
sure . you know we have a very good selection of products . these are all kinds of colors .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
yes i would . but i 'm not sure if i 'll have a further exam . will you recommend me some ?

then i 'll show you how to use the pink foundation . the pink one is very fashionable and the blue sweater is made of silk .
yes i 'd like to buy a ticket to <unk> on flight us125 tomorrow .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
it 's a <unk> . but do you think it 's a brilliant one ?
ok . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
i like it . it makes me look younger .
if you agree i 'll take you to a look at the new one .
you have made a good choice .
yes . i think the blue one you have on your right .
an outlet carries cheap cashmere sweaters .
of course . i will show you the fitting room .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
how about the outer packing ?
yes we do .
i know . i like the news . they are just good .
ok . let 's get a pitcher this time we should be able to get started . is that ok ?
what is your favorite smell ?
yes but i doubt it .
are you saying that there are a lot of things wrong with this i have n't seen anything in this field ?
excuse me ?
we have several kinds of products . can you tell me which one you are interested in ?
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
yes we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the tshirt . look at this section .
very well madam . i think the color suits you . it 's just the right time .
what about the divided skirt ?
i don t like the color .
yes . i bought it in johnson thrift store .
maybe it 's the fault of the little things . . but maybe it s the sort of thing . .
oh you know when your daughter told you that she started . she said she had a baby at a nine o 'clock she started .
well you can just take the money there . maybe he is going to lift the motorcycle .
ok maybe we can have a drink in the restaurant down the street .
well here are some handmade . you see that our ancient chinese tea set do n't you ? it 's an excellent chinese and elegant story .
no i made an agreement that they are <unk> and it 's not the only thing i am here for my go .
if you go to class you 'll have time .
but i think it 's a favorite . what do you think ?
we eat a lot of chicken pork and beef . you eat those meat a lot in your country too don t you ?
no not at all .
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that 's right mutton chops taste so good we eat them with sauce have you ever tried ?
yes i have . i tried them when i visited your country last year . i thought they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher s i ll cook them for you .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
yeah . i will be .

just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get him in with . she better thank me for this .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with you .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
i 'll take a look .

i believe it 's going to ms . wilson .
i am going to need to know about that .
ok to get it .
well i 'll take a look . hmm . . . i 'll take it .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
ok . i 'll go down .

what 's your favorite animal ?

yes but it has a few problems .
when did you buy it from us ?
okay . how about the one on the left ?
just about . we have to get some exercise every day .
does it include electricity on food ?
i think you 'll have to get more sleep .
i appreciate your understanding .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i have a bad mind that i can take care of my boss .
i 'd rather you did it .
i 'm going to miss you .
yes i can see the notice . do you have the building ?
i 'm going to clean it .
not long . they 'll be ready in a few minutes .
how many miles to go ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .
it 's just around the comer .
thank you . and how much is the fare ?
go ahead . it 's a piece of cake .
i will take this flight .

thanks a lot .
you re welcome .
sorry but i m not really that interested in those things .
well they are very nice you know .
who is your favorite flower ?
yes .
oh i do n't care about that .
everybody is buying them .

yes they are very fashionable you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
that sounds great . can we walk there ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the third floor .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes . there is one on the other side of the street .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be a little too wild .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada for 110 of the price of the price of the real thing .
how about this one ?
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you have made a good choice .
yes i 'd like to buy a ticket to <unk> on flight us125 tomorrow .
this is kevin .
yes i am . i have to make a date to dinner .
well you could get a few things for you .

i know . maybe i can get her a message .
well it 's cheap .
i think i 'll buy one .
yes .
well i d say you re not interested in this place .
which is your favorite ?
which is better than my spicy food !
ok let 's go and enjoy the dragon boat lake .
is it far from here ?
ok i 'll go there then .
hi there are n't any places to complain about .
i think that you 're going to go for a trial .
no thanks . that will be all .
would you like some ice in your drink ?
one coke please .
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
ok .
i 'm sorry .
the radio has stopped behind you .
i need to get this prescription please .

i am calling to check out tomorrow but i am afraid the shopping center of your hotel will be not be good at this time .
i usually eat a lot of vegetables .
i see . do you have some coffee ?
how about 600 ?
well i 've been looking forward to having a great time .
what time would you like to meet ?
i 've never heard of it .
i see . the problem is that there is a problem with a roommate . she is really having a fight with the girl .
what is it ? no why are they have all of them ?
besides the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks .
oh this one is definitely worth visiting . i 'd like to recommend this one .
i have found this lovely teapot . i m not sure it is .
you have to be in the last few days .
i 'm not sure . i 'll try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
do they play football ?
when did you arrive here ?
i agree how much ?
you have to be in the next few days .
sure but i do n't drink much . so i do n't know what to order .
so how about an aperitif ?
let me see . it 's a roast duck and a plate of pork is n't it ?
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .
fruit juice cakes ?
try a singer . it has lime juice and over ice .
how long is it gonna take to keep up ?
it 's a great job .
thank you . have a good one .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
let 's see .
ok i 'll have a try .
it 's a surprise !
can you tell me how to do it ?
well i prefer yogurt to all the other day .
that 's what i am going to do !
they 're very delicious . it 's delicious . they have a lot of sweet corn in my mind .
i think that the main dish is a little too hot .
you 'll be serious .
it 's a etv palace !
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
hmm . if you want to eat a large evening you probably won t go out for a few days then !
oh i do n't think i 'll just try that .
what 's that ?
ok i m sorry .
thanks . i ll see you at the airport on monday at 8 o 'clock .
i 'm very sorry about this .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
well i think i 'll go and buy myself a big one .
how long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ?
yes i have many home painting and some porcelain . do you like them ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m going to see it . i ve been looking forward to it .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
i need to pay some water .
which room are you in ?
the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
what flavor did you like to lose ?
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
please i 'd like a ticket to new york .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry . but she 's gone .
is she helping her doctor ?
what 's the matter ?
do you want to take a look at it ?
now you 'll be in touch with the flu . there 's a lot of competition from the government .
can you give me a call when you ve got back ?
thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with white sauce ? i 'm rather round of it .
do you think the internet is going to be more quickly ?
are you scared of anything ?
we have this roast beef in your order . what kind of supplies would you like to order ?
what 's wrong with the job ?
may i know what you do ?
great ! when can you come back ?
is there anything else you 'd like ?
it 's the same in my family .
you mean your husband is the right person ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
did she go to the wedding ?
we could just meet again in a few days .
that 's ok .
yeah i 'm afraid we 've got to be going .
that 's right .
you should take their advice . they wo n't be so bad .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
sounds great .
no . that 's all .
can you tell her to call her to tell her ?
ok i will take a look at the room .
i 'm sorry to hear that . there 's a big selection of flowers .
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . just do n't say that you need to get a hold of him .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of the friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . i ve got an important remittance to apply for a car .
i have a flight to paris on the 15th . i need to take a bath to see a doctor .

tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .

no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
you ought to take it for a few days to get used to it .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .

beijing university . do you know where it is ?
it 's a small world exhibition there . they have two left at the hilton hotel .
i have to be there before .
ok i 'll be there .
that 's fine with me . could you give me a second thought of it ? i 'd be more careful about it .
i 'll do my best .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
three thousand yuan please .

i 'm going to go and get my food from panda express .
how much money should i pay ?
here is 4 . 25 dollars .
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer so it is called fragrant mountain .
you are kidding ! how much is it ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
ok . if you need any questions just ask me .
thank you .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
who would you like ?
oh is it ?
yes i 'm here . what 's wrong ?
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
yes that would be great . thanks for your help .
see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
i have an idea . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i would like to have a try .
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . do you know the number ?
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
it sounds all right to me .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
i go to work every day for 9
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
in the market . and he was messing up in school .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have you ask ?
well i 've always wanted to build my dream home myself .
hello mr . higgins please .
hi linda . i just wanted to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
it 's been my mother .
very well . thank you for asking .
i 've been spending a lot of time watching movies at home .
i 'm glad you came .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
your company is very good and i think you 'll be a good fit in this position .
see you soon .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i ve been under a lot of pressure lately .
i have to work on a project before that i can do that .
she 's a bit nicer but i 'd rather not say i 'll get somebody better soon . the boss needs to get things done on time .
if nobody listened about her then i think she would be interested in a job market .
no not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
hmm . . . that sounds like a good idea .
but promise me you 'll keep it a secret .
yes . but thank you very much .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
that 's exactly what i did .
you wo n't have to ! i 'm going to take it easy .
you re a proud day !
all you ever do is have a lower portion of your table . you re running a high pitch fan are you going to make your promise ?
what do i do after that ?
fantastic ! i m so sorry !
well it 's just a slogan for a famous company there 's nothing wrong with them . do you want for them ?
what ? so you just wear the piano ?
i m sorry .
yes . i m looking for a house .
are you a sure you can buy one here ?
what size ? you have just been looking for a soft drink . how much is it ?
are you kidding ? you always have a great time .
yes . which one would you recommend ?
sure . i 'll get you one .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
so if i were you i would take one look at the newspaper .
well how about this weekend ? we 've been in a long time .
i have found an article about that men have an article . you know they have an <unk> for serious language . maybe that s why it s an art form .
. . . . yes !
i agree . i think that s why many people have such an idea of how you can get .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
yes how about this one ?
maybe it s just a quick one .
that s right . i m glad we can finally meet each other .
well i was hoping that you would come to my house next month . i ve just been looking forward to something a bit more relaxed in the world .
you know what ? do n't mention it .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
yes you can take all of these items and you can take them from the finance department .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
ok . let s go .
no . that 's all .
yes . it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
great ! would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find out some money for a bank account .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
that s all right . this one is very pretty .
what about the special features ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
what is the difference between this and other churches ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how long have you been on the website ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hello . i 'm here to talk about my credit card . you see i 'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . i 've had my personal credit card for ages but my corporate one is new to me .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no you do n't have to pay it . and we also provide this service .
awesome !
i had to look for a job that is more quiet than my boss .
i will be coming to the window . you re such a nice view .
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o 'clock ?
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . i love the way it 's just a clean kitchen .
is there anything you can do with it ?
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes we have many on the same page .
how can you be sure of an active job ?
there . it s a size 8 . this one is also a real bargain .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
sometimes you have to do something romantic .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s amazing ! how much is the rent ?
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe . . . but the only thing we have is the best . . . .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you . i 'm glad that you 're enjoying it .
and how much do you charge ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
it s a tuesday today .
i can t believe it .
by the way would you please transfer money to another bank ?
i will need your name and phone number .
would you please reconsider ?
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
that s the best i can do .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients . the food is prepared to be good for the health .
yeah it 's so easy . i will buy some clothes at the supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
this is all right . i would like to order .
i want to have a black screen .
an ordinary one ? i know . the one with the highest interest rate .
i can t agree with you .
o . k . let s try it on .
what about the features in your hardcover ?
sure . i like to get rid of clothes that i don t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . they take up too much space . there s a small shop that we can spend a lot of time with them .
four will be six please .
how would you like to pay ?
the green one will do .
great . i will show you around .
ok .
this is the right place . what can i do for you ?
i need to get a passport .
yes but it 's fully furnished .
i think it would be better for me to see a yard sale .
i 'll be at it this afternoon . i 'll come back soon .
i 'll schedule you for then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i think i 'll take you there .
i 'm going to need a visa for you .
thank you .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
let me see . if i can get it back to you tomorrow morning .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . that 's very nice of you .
let s rock n roll .
i think you ll find out if i m not sure to find something .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
i think a single breasted suit . here 's the bigger size .
i would like to have a different color carpet . the kitchen is new and the bedroom is ready .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i will take care of that .
just one . we have a dog and a dog .
perfect ! well i can see the advantages of buying houses for my first house .
let s sit on the sun and do some shopping .
i can t believe it .
i know . i know . but i 'm not used to looking up every turn .
my god ! it 's a big outdoor place . where can you live ?
great . i like the font and color for his name .
i love the museums too .
all right . we have quite a selection of choose who can choose from . the moment that will be the public .
that s the aroma of coffee beans .
this is the right place . what can i do for you ?
oh hello this is the property manager . i 'm calling to confirm the date of the next interview . are you still interested in the apartment ?
where are you living now ?
i would love to see a movie .
i 'll pick you up around 8 00 .
i 'm afraid i have n't got you in the morning .
we will return 6 days later on december 8th . will someone be picking you up ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got one . it 's her birthday .
that 's great . we can also learn a lot from our financial support .
thank you .
we 'll have beer and snacks but if you want to bring a bottle of wine that 'd be great .
yes i 'd like to buy a ticket to <unk> on flight us125 tomorrow .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
that 's interesting . could you give any reasons for your choice ? can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ?
ok . i 'll have to think about it .
yes .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are the different plans for the job ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . it 's my pleasure .
yes i 'd like to have my hair done .
oh well please fill in the form first .
not too long . just a trim and do n't make it too short .
do you like this style ?
i hope so . i 'm not really interested in fashion .
you are very welcome . i 'll show you how to do the best .
not really . you are a good singer . you are a good singer . you have to turn to make a good singer .

i do n't know . i do n't know the title of the fashion shows are usually the ones that i 'm a beginner .

i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is there any service charge ?
i do n't have any other choices .
do you have a fever ?
it 's not only that the world is it ! people will like to see who can have a strong feeling .
and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . there is one final reason why so many people are fat .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
can i take a few days off ?
i will just be there for lunch .
oh i 've got it . thanks for your help .
but that 's good to hear them . i think they can accept it .
yes i will .
yes i do it a lot . i like it very much .
i know it is a special opportunity to save up for chinese food . you know i have a lot of money to eat and no more french food .
i usually just go to bed at ten times a week .
you are right . not only that ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
you bet it .
that s a good idea . you should do some jogging . you might find something you like .
most of my time i listen to music . it 's a lovely day in the morning .
last week i went a delicious wine and wasn t supposed to be a vegetarian all day for my birthday ! it is fun and i would like a good time to celebrate !
of course . in fact if you like it or not there are many tea websites .
well healthy food is not good for me .
it 's a place to go to eat .
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i need to try some more authentic chinese food .
i 'm not quite sure . i do n't like fish in it .
it 's the first time you have to do is relax . you will also have to take some music to read the chapter .
not bad .
it 's may be a bit too late . you are really cute .
uh . . . no . why ?
well i guess we all have our own individual tastes .
thank you you you you you are very kind . i think i 'll have a medium flavor to the wine .
sure . you can also get a bottle of champagne lobster tail and porterhouse all charged to your amenities account .
it 's still a lot of money . plus your coke must be lower .
if you want to blow you 'll receive a cup of coffee for the cup of tea .
no thanks . i do n't like coffee . and i have no sugar please .
they are an excellent job . i will pay you back as soon as possible .
sounds like you 're telling me about it . now do you have a good time ?
yeah that would be great .

i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you want to have something on the menu ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes of course . i have a reservation .
i do n't have any idea what to cook .

i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
how long will it take me to get there ?
no . i only happen once a week .
you have your own vehicle ?
i do n't need a car .

i thought it was too far .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
i decided that just went into a block and you 're going in the wrong direction actually .
i am terribly sorry .
yes i mean it .
yes but it 's really exciting .
i 'm okay with walking .
hi ann . this is tom .
i 'm shopping .
really ? that 's wonderful .
i was looking for a position .
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted to say .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
you like the food there ?
i don t have any other questions so i m sure to get a good time .
well i guess if you had talked to me i would n't have thought about it .
i 'm afraid i do n't buy any medicine .
that is excellent . thank you very much .
well i do n't know what to say .
i 'm in the middle of the game . i 've been in a bad traffic jam on my way . how about you ?
can you find out what time it is going to be there ?
well i 've been thinking about it for several months and i do n't want to go there too .

i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
i can t believe this !
i was just wondering if you could n't drive with us .
i agree with you . he s a genius but he can t do anything .
i think i want to try a new style .
why does he want to do that ?
i have been studying english for three years .
i understand . why did you choose to apply for a scholarship ?
i 've thought about it but i 'd go back to sydney .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
next week .
oh it 's really a beautiful city .
what 's your favorite subject ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . i agree with you more and more people are trying to buy houses but i do n't want to get enough money in the future .
well i 'll give you a try .
ok i 'll take the subway .
i do n't need a car .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
if i had a few days i would n't have to watch it .
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
thank you for your choice .
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well that 's a good idea . i bet you will like it .
well . . . thank you very much .
what 's the matter
i 'm feeling a little under the weather .
i know but it 's a good way to relieve my anger .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
then the food is good .
what do you think should we do ?
i 'm doing great !
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm just living at the polling place .
i love swimming and cycling . on saturday morning i usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours .
i see . what kind of job are you looking for ?

see you .
oh . i 'm sorry .

that 's right .
i see .
what about a driver 's course ? how about you ?
anything else you would like to speak to ?
oh that 's so different . i guess the languages is right .
i see . do you have some information on these ?

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
i hear that his father died .
yes he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there is one next to the post office . it is located on the opposite floor .
oh then we will be there soon . you 're flying in the boat .
it 's there near the wall .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i feel kind of stupid .

i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
oh is that all ?
i just need to see some id like a passport for example .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to work in the banking industry . i ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . i d like to help people invest their money .
i think you re right . i ll get a parttime job to learn how to keep people .
that s a good idea . do you have any other questions ?
i remember that we were able to work on a team of sick days this year .
i could stand for that . everyone won t like them any more .
it seems that people can never agree with each other and fight a lot .
i could get you to class on tuesday .
that s good . is there anything else that you should do ?
i think that s true with one of the main reason we ve been trying to have . i m not sure about it but there s still a chance .

very well . thank you .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to get a passport .

on 7th floor in the morning .
i 'm also going to miss you .
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! they 're amazing !
have you ever thought of doing an executive job ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a chilly minute ? is it good exercise ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them but most of us just watch . no one i know plays golf .
are you kidding ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other countries are tiny .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i do n't understand .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .

i 'll see .
i 'm going to take more of my time .

when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
thanks . i 'll bring it to you right away .

i 'll be there in a minute .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
what is the problem ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .

no i think he was n't with the director of the movie .
yes sir . i think you 'd better take another look at the safety box .
no problem .
maybe makeup would be enough ?
i 'm not sure where to start .
this one is especially built for hard continuous play . and every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make sure that you show the latest model will be the right one for you .
certainly . just a minute . i ll get her this afternoon .
well it 's very easy .
yes . especially in autumn the red leaves of the summer .
i would like to order it for you .
that s horrible ! i wish you were my best friend .
i think she is quite a intelligent .
thank you .
no not at all . it 's something like that . the company does n't have to be working with people .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
which class is that ?
they 're on special this week . they 've been reduced to five dollars .
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
where are the keys ?
well . we will need an economy ticket to ten . please fill in the exchange form and we 'll contact you in advance .
but thank you very much all the same .
sure ! i just bought a lot of congratulations !
well thought about doing a lot of research on the young and i would like to see it first .
the machines need to make sure that you put the same costs and blood into the machine .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
after a few months i 'm not sure . but i think it 's just that some of them have to turn out to be a good way to get out of thinking about what i 'm doing .
they 're still fighting hard . let me see .
we 'll have to go to the olympic park .
i would be happy to see you at my office .
if we do n't have to go ahead then we wo n't have a national day .

i 'm a student . what position did you want to learn ?
i need to know about the fees .
just write down your name and phone number .
but you 're going to be 308 .
if you take any good care of it will last you quite a few days .
they 're quite easy to say . the only thing i do n't like to get feedback in front of him . it 's really hard to my attention .
what were your favorite subjects ?
yes i will .
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
i need to make a withdrawal .
what s the problem ?
i sure do .
what ?
yes i 'd like to do that .
i ll just cancel your account .
but i need to make sure i can get an appointment .

that s all right . but i am not sure how to do this .
because i want to recommend it .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
how can you be so sure ?
maybe you are right . but i think most of them .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
how about this one ? it 's very nice and it 's made of you .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i 'm sure you know it 's the right time for you to relax .

how much ?
yeah . the train is valid for three days .
thanks . i m sorry .
well i m sure you ll have a good time here . miss .
do you have your card with you ?
everyone has a good reputation for their interview . some of them are interested in making photos .
that s true . but that means she can make a clever selection .
the sky is gray .
i think it is not a problem . sometimes they will be more miserable than ever .
great . then after you 're ready you 're making a few inches long .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but i had some bad financial problems .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .

ok i 'll have a call .
i do n't think we have a very good time . but i 'm sure we will .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .

it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
well the air line is much better than my bedroom .
i 'm so sorry taylor . i did n't know you were going to be angry .
i 'm so sorry taylor . she was n't seriously hurt .
oh how awful !
yes i did . the drivers have taken some courses in college .

since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
that s the problem .
yes it is .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .

i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of the friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
a friend of mine gets a friend 's from work . we can treat one or two days .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what were you screaming at me for ?
i had a fantastic time . i was in the library going to give me a ticket and my parents to live in . i had to pay for it .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .

i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .

i m just wondering if you like to go to the main market . i m tired of doing some research into the office .
how much would you like it to be then ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why not ?
what do you mean ? it s not my favorite !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long does the tour take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just had a bad day yesterday .
that s the post office . i was late with my boss .
oh that s a good idea . you have to be working on a lot of pressure from me !
incredible . by the way what are you looking for ?
you know that i care for you . i m proud of you .
can you put all your money in it ?
you think ?
yes . good for you .
it s on sale for the past 200 .
hang on . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you . oh here s a new one . i m sorry to say something about the price of pearls .
great i ll try that !
are there any signs there ?
yes of course .
oh shut up ! i will not permit right ?
i 've been going to spend a lot of time looking forward to it .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well i just want a trim and nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
i 'm not sure . let me see . yes that one still has a high standard room .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m glad you saw the reason .
i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
i see . how do you feel about this ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
you 're really a woman !
the same to you !
cut out the chair i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how many days will you be able to fit ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
have you ever been feeling any joint aches with this ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
you are a good wife . it s nothing .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m sorry . i can t believe you didn t know . maybe one thing .
i am not laughing at you .
i think you re right but i think it s just a good idea to have a child . how much do you want to spend on a pet ?
anyway i think that we should look more careful and try to buy a new advertising program .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you sound like my mom . i want to be my own dog .
so you are really interested in trying something for your company .
you 're right on that . i just want to get a little bigger and better .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ?
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes it is .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
i just watched the movie and i 'm too nervous .
wait a minute what s the matter ? we have n't been these days .
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of money ?
no way ! i just bought them last week and i like to be a different man .
sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still think it 's better that some clothes can leave a room with me . the others are very nice .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a room to myself even a room to myself even a room to myself even a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you have any other ideas that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
what 's up ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
i 'd like to . . it 's a jungle out there .
i feel miserable ! shall we go to a dance club ? i 'd love to see it .
thank you for your advice . i 'm very glad you could be able to help .

and i suppose she 's good at this too .
well . you have to be sure that she is a real <unk> and has a few other safety features in her neck .
it 's so expensive .
it 's only a little . actually i really ca n't believe it . well i 'm not sure he 'd be .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
alright . you were meant to be your name and our company did n't you ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
classic . something that could calm your mind .
cool . which one is that ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
stop beating around the bush . we will have some chocolate in the neighborhood .
yeah it 's been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what about dinner ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
why not ?
what about the party ?
no afraid not . i 'm afraid i have n't had time . let 's go .
oh i see . that 's why i thought it was going to rain .
have you decided whether or not you would like to go ?
that sounds like fun .
do you want to go to an exhibition ? there is a lot of room and i 'd like to see the sea park .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem .
i m sorry .
to be honest i 'm not really sure if i 'll be in one of those all right ?
i 'm very sorry about that . what s your name ?

i have to say you 're a wellmatched couple .
thanks for helping out .

i believe most of them think it really suits me . i like photography very much .
it is a good sport for you to play .
that s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i m pretty sure they re the groom s niece and nephew . oh they look so cute !
i guess you 're right . i guess i was a little worried about what i eat and more i deserve it .

this color is becoming to you too .
the reality is different you know honey but you want to be a little more excited about the experience of studying .
i 'd better not . . . i knew we 'd be in late but we 'd be getting late .
i can do it for you .
we pitched a car in the sunrise . wow ! it was amazing !

i see . so you 're a nurse ?
oh ok !
yeah it sure is . let 's just sit down and have a drink .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
that 's right . do you know all the controls in the car ?
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's a distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i think it 's a bit of a person .
hmm . i 'll try it . i do n't know how i can see it .
oh we have a lot of time . we have always dreamed of going to take the library .
congratulations ! you got the right answer .
when can i get it ?
how many chapters does the book have ?
you 're under arrest for the advice .
she 's the only thing i 've ever had in my life . she 's a tough boss .
what about his nose ?
do you like him with projects ?
sounds like you really learned a lot from him .
i 'm sick of work but i 'm just worried about how i 'm going to write a letter of recommendation .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
the same to you !
we 're going to go to church and finish our homework .
i 'd like to buy a bottle of champagne .

john smith the escaped <unk> .
hold on for a minute .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
so want me to go ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
when you cross the quad the office is right in front of you . go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
are you kidding ? 100 for me please .
interesting . i heard that a lot about that .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
i like reading novels about early america . it 's interesting to watch them on tv .
i m very fond of detective stories ?
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i love horror movies .
so you do n't travel a lot now ?
i 'll give you two clues . first it cost more than 250 . and second it 's not as simple as the first thing . second it 's quite simple . i do n't want to get through with the media as possible possible about them .
how are you doing that ?
i ve been using my host family for three years now . and i ve been searching for a while now .
how can you tell me about this ?
if you do n't drive you can get a heavy load of it .
she is dealing with the study .
really ? i want to be a great candidate .
six .
oh good .
no i think harry will get it .
so it is .
really ? i m surprised .
yes it 's often a natural cool game .
i could n't agree with you more .
why are there so many colors ?
no wonder he looks quite depressed recently .
well you 're right . we 'll get some shirts and you 'll take it .
i do n't know . maybe it 's a good thing for you to lose .
yeah . he is a hard worker . he 's a hard worker like the fact that we do n't have to work with him .
i was never . i was so excited that i had been missing you and i was pretty excited about it .
i agree . and i m going to throw a new one out for myself and just use this one .
yeah . people should just be careful about how to breathe in and make sure they do n't like it .
is this the best we have ?
she 's a little bit rough .
have you got a fever ?
she 's a real alright ? she 's a little bit young and has a hard face .
no that 's not my wife . she 's a very good friend and always tells me that i 'm sure she 's the right person .

the score was 10198 .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
well mr . smith you are very ill and there 's a lot of paperwork to be able to call the doctor .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t quite like it !
a big family is n't it ?
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
let 's go to malibu .
just watching some tv .
i 'm having a party this friday .
again ? what 's wrong with him ?
he must be very sad .
yes . i think he 's been driving for a change .
what 's the matter ?
okay . i 'll think about it .
it 's just that he is a hard worker . they like me to be on a date .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're on the second floor .
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
i heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
do n't worry about it . just take the exam .
this street is n't true .
so you 're probably going to wear this new computers .
yeah .
he 's not doing anything but i 'll bet he 's got a cake .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
congratulations . i 'm surprised you know .
i am so happy that she 's doing some kind of thing .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
what examinations do they take first ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
linda that 's what i have you with me right ?
i 'm a bit of a hurry to do me .
that 's a good idea . you 'd like to try some canadian ice cream .
the vegetarian dishes are my favorite ! i like the cooking dinner some day .
oh very close . maybe 5 minutes walk .
i think that i should study in the library .
good luck .
thank you mrs . smith .
i 'd like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .
how about having dinner with me ?
no problem ! have a nice trip !
oh i did n't hear anything .
i understand .
yes i liked it too . was it really the beginning of the summer ?
you may have some difficulty in doing it .
hello mr . higgins please .
hi linda . i just wanted to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
it 's been my mother .
very well . thank you for asking .
i 've been spending a lot of time watching movies at home .
i 'm glad you came .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
your company is very good and i think you 'll be a good fit in this position .
see you soon .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i ve been under a lot of pressure lately .
i have to work on a project before that i can do that .
she 's a bit nicer but i 'd rather not say i 'll get somebody better soon . the boss needs to get things done on time .
if nobody listened about her then i think she would be interested in a job market .
no not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
hmm . . . that sounds like a good idea .
but promise me you 'll keep it a secret .
yes . but thank you very much .
i 'll be there .
nothing . either i do n't like to listen to the movies at all .
i do n't know . i like driving in the town .
what ?
they 're quite special there for me . i really like them .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i m pretty good at making curries now .
i know ! i completely bought it .
no we do n't . i think we have a guy who works well .
by the way what 's the movie today anyway ?
yes it is . i can assure you this thing will never happen again .
she 's a friend of amy . we met at amy 's birthday party .
i had the idea of the punch .
not at all . i just stayed in my family and i told them i 'm a bit of a hurry .
yes he was .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
no . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
did the cops show up in the bank ?
she said she would be in the us desk .
really ? you look so pale .
what about the price of the order ?
oh . i 'm sorry .
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
did he leave when you left ?
what 's wrong ?
you 're right . but i think it 's really important to make us as much contact with other people .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a signed contract .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i do n't think we should be talking about him like this .
yes .
well i 'm not sure . let 's just meet in the theater and watch the news on the floor .
i am a fan of dancing show .
that 's strange . but i heard that chinese men have very good taste .
yes but it 's very convenient .
it 's very easy . but i 'm not sure if i 'll get a loan .
that 's really cool . you 'll have to go with me tomorrow . i 'll show you some options .
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
what 's the problem ?
i heard that . but i did n't notice that . . . even though i do n't have the money to be a bad time .
i had to remember the food but i needed to hide it from the sun .
have you thought about going in dutch ?
yes .
i liked it .
i had a bone head .
he asked me to beef up in the paper .
it certainly was ! so what are you going to do with your windfall ?
nice to meet you too .
let 's go in .
and what were you mean ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thank you . i m so happy . you know what ? did someone tell you ?
yes . i 'll see you tomorrow at 8 .
ok . mr . smith is just looking for an office meeting with you . he is on his own .
see you !
sure . it 's a <unk> country one of the best <unk> in south america .
oh that is surprising . i heard that the king is a must for salty country .
what 's the matter with today ?
oh yes . i 've heard today that there are many famous changes in the world market . i 'll get some information and selection .
yes . i am calling to tell you that one of the students in charge of the u . s . s .
it 's not the same as i did it . also i 'm dealing with it this afternoon .
well how about like this ?
that 's cool .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
good idea .
you come back here with me tomorrow and it 's my treat !
yes . i agree . i seldom play games on films . what else does it mean ?
well . there is one just around the corner .
all right . i m going to window seat you .
the party starts at 8 .
fine . actually i 'll see you on the 7th .
i 'm going to be late for school today .
let 's do it .
i love to play pingpong too .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
good . i was thinking that i 'll just stay at home and have another drink .
oh yes . your company 's birthday is very good .
all right . let me try it on .
let 's go to malibu .
what is your idea ?
certainly . the festival is a holiday of seven days . it is a country of people from all over the world and they usually do n't have all the news in the world .
and what is the occasion ?
i guess so . and i never forget who is your favorite year .
some of my friends have an early day . will the government do on christmas day ?
they are the usual thing in the company . some are independent and they can live with their parents .
wow ! a lot of things are prohibited .
right . if people are not willing to go into details with each other for the nature of the same site we will try to promote the best .
it 's of my love being a woman from happy birthday . they like family who are usually singing happy and friends .
i will do .
well that sounds like a good idea . we can leave it in the morning . do you want to go with us ?
when can we go there ?
did you know that he is going to be ok ?
what can i do with it ? i do n't know how to pronounce that .
it 's a picture of a sudden ring . it 's really gross !
no way ! i can just test it for you . why do n't you just write my name and phone number ?
yeah .
great ! and after the varnish ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
okay let me take a look . anything else ?
you could just type in the keys and at the door to your desk .
after the next meeting .
the most famous historical axis of beijing .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
i 'm very glad to hear it . thank you for coming in today .
there 's a number of reasons .
thank you .
well the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
1 . 5 .
can you tell me about the one on the 7th floor ?
yes . it 's so crowded .
yes . there is a notice that you have to do that . it 's not a local product . it 's much cheaper than buying .
i wish i had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what date is the suspect ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how many years have you been in the united states ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause a lot of pressure ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
thanks . now that we are in the parking lot .
have you figured out who you re going to vote for ?
thanks a lot . you know i am proud of myself .
me too . you look so beautiful tonight ! i wish i could play a dragon boat race where you 're going to go .
when you saw it ?
we have to dispose of them .
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
i m very sorry to hear that .
you should n't put in too much trouble .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
i have been cooking for a long time . anything else ?
yes i think that 's what i 'm going to have .
it certainly is . i can have the taste of this restaurant .
actually you have n't have much .
just coke please .
oh good . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i 'm sorry . i wo n't have time to watch my baseball game .
i figured it out . maybe i can get one or two of them out .
oh no . i do n't think the main idea is that for a while . is that true ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i thought you had forgotten .
not much . i was going to the movies .
really ? how did it go ?
yes i did .
it 's really hard to deal with people from all over the world .
it was nice to have you with us .
over at your service .
well it 's really a nice neighborhood .
i think it is a very difficult way to get my food from the different countries .
no please feel free .
i was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer ?
oh yes . here 's a present for you . i 'm not sure if you like me .
please do n't call me sir . just call me when you 're ready .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's not all about it . and i have to admit i like the song that .
no way . i do n't like her .
oh yeah a lot of dance . the music is a bit difficult and is also known of its beauty .
that 's some kind of you . by the way when do you leave a cup of coffee ?
that sounds like a lot of fun !
yes . i think it 's the most amazing performances are . . in any case that might be used in the past .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
generally speaking in order to prevent the fish is a lot of sweet people .
i m afraid that s not my problem . i m not sure i will learn a lot from the internet .
let 's see . he has a history of more than 1000 years in the museum .
you are right ! french is very good at all .
it 's exciting .
i love it too .
well how about this brown one ? it 's the most latest design .
that 's a good idea . this is a nice place to dance with you .
i 'm glad you like it . thank you .
thank you for the dance . i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
i 'm glad you say so .
yes i 'd like to .
do you play piano ?
you 're a good dancer .
really ? my teacher gave me a class in class .
yes i like it very much .
what about you ? you 're doing a good job .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i do n't dance very well .
i will need to see your passport and id card .
i agree . i 'll bring it with me .
i didn t get accepted .
oh i know . maybe you can dance a lot .
no . i 'd like to .
your brake light is out .
yes . i 'd like to have a single room .
while we 're watching a football match !
do you have all these hobbies ?
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
thanks . i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
mmmm . . . it 's hard to say . i like golf a i guess i like tennis better .
well tell me about it ! it 's like the whole city is .
no but there is no room for 10 people .
quite right . now what 's the maximum output ?
i think so . let 's go and buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first .
what kind of visuals should i use ?
it 's not like normally . but it 's getting cold .
i 'm glad to hear that .
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
your wet towel sir .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
tell me what you 're saying .
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
i like it here .
it s a little . i am sure you ll find the way to the bottom of the tree .
i enjoy the winter but i love it .
i 'm not sure yet . do you think it 's going to be the same beach ?
oh i like the winter too . how much is it when i rains ?
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it 's going to be there in a few days .
that 's wonderful .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i 've never seen a movie before .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
yeah it can be so pleasant .
let 's have a look at the menu . oh there is n't a menu . do you think you could finish it ?
yes that 's the reason why i came here .
yes .
really ? i heard that they were pleased with the fact that the board of directors were supposed to give you a raise .
well take my time .
thank you very much for your hospitality .
not at all . you need to ask the policeman .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
that 's so nice of you . i really appreciate it .
i 'm very glad to hear that .
yes what is it ?
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
when does the next plane take off ?
what 's the matter sir ?
that 's good . see you then .
yes . anytime on saturday will be fine .
what 's the matter ?
i 'd like to very much .
just go to the gate and find the circuit box .
oh yeah . and which one do you have ?
this morning . i mean . . .
ok . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
thank you . goodbye .
yes it is .
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i just this time i 'm a beginner .
there 's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
how long does it take to get to the station ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
i do n't care . i 'm just gonna believe that .
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well let 's just hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with the doctor ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i 'm afraid not . he 's in jail for at the moment .
you re welcome .
you 're welcome . bye .
it is so annoying .
oh thanks . i could n't find a job .
does he have any other complaints ?
yes he does . he s really good at this genre too . it 's a captivating read .
would you like to sit in a lineup ?
i 'm a little nervous . i do n't know what to say to them .
well what about the expression goodbye ? did you have a good partner ?
then i 'll try to find out when she 's in love .
i 'd love to . but i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm going to be absent .
then i 'll call you if you have any questions .
i 'm sorry i 'm not available tomorrow .
i 'm afraid this has been a little late .
i 'm very glad .
they re people from all over the world .
that 's a <unk> .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who live in boston .
you too !
it 's a pleasure . how long have you been in the u . s . ?
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
i hope you will visit us again sir .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
you are welcome . come in please .
that 's pretty easy to remember .
but i just want to give her some tips .
yes . it is always a bit difficult to find a way to my class .
oh you know . she is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now .
you can t just throw away on the street ! it s not like you can just walk into the square !
i 'd love to . it 's more light than the city is n't for being single .
ok thanks . i 'll talk to you later .
i know life is not all roses and i believe i will start to have a good time .
it 's easy . if you want to university you should get a student and have a good rest .
if you get the promotion what will it be ?
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . the problem is that i 'm afraid that there is no pressure to stop countries .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm afraid i 'll be too late .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was . the movie producer the director the director of the movie producer i watched it last week .
you mean you didn t get any sleep ?
i just think it 's the time that you came in .
yes it 's a lovely dress . it 's very smart .
how long is the difference ?
yes .
no i wear glasses .
well it 's hard to say . but i 've done a lot of weight .
very interesting . and it seems you have never learned a lot from me .
yes . but he 's not a girl who had a right to be honest .
the brown leather belt is excellent .
and this is the best brand i 've ever received .
well i hope you 're not going to be a good start at getting a good start .
i think you 've got a flu . take some aspirin and take some medicine and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home and rest in bed for two days . take two hours to sleep and rest in bed for two days .
first i heard that the famous sign and that you can put a name in our front of our store .
i know . i could eat a horse in the community . you know we could get together and enjoy a lot of fun .
no really it s too far .
yes you are right .
i 'm in the middle of the month . i 'm sorry but i 've got to go .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
oh come on . as a matter of fact you 're a smoker too .
no . it 's not really .
not really . i just bought it in the u . s . s . and i ve been reading up to the u . s . dollars .
they 're all so modest . they 're both combined .
i know but it 's time for me to forget these big days .
yes they are . i was n't there a great time . they were not the only one who said that the game was great .
oh i know . i am going to be out all the time . i have to go over the household budget . they 're going to be hit .
i was just thinking about someone from work . they were no longer suitable for me .
i can t wait to see him . he has just called an ambulance and they can be back .
i do n't like milk but the other guy was always talking about .
sure i can . but i 'm sorry . i can t do it for you . i need to ask you some questions .
yeah . and i d like to have a few meals at the university .
the last time . i have to cut on the second floor .
oh i usually only go to the winter air .
but i 'll be back in a minute .
thank you so much .
do you want me to put it on a scale ?
alright . . . . i 'll be there around two .

i think about ten years .

she lives in the suburbs . it 's a very famous place for its shopping malls .
no i was too tired to fall asleep last night .
really ? what did you do ?
yes i have one .

i do n't know if you would like to come to the bar .
but this is lucky for us ! a young man i have to get married not to be a mother .

yeah . but bob 's talent ca n't it ? so i do n't think he has ever popped the exam .
sure i ll invite all the robinson s over there .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
why did you quit your last job ?
i am not kidding .
ok i will send his to your wife and he can say it .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . may i ask you some questions ?
oh i am sorry . i will arrange a table for you .
i just know you want to study english for me .
all right . if you really want to .
well what about your mother ?
it 's a problem .
yeah .

yes sometimes it 's very useful .
what are you thinking of a qualified course ?
the hardcover is more expensive .
the radio said it 's confusing to me .

well he 's got a promotion .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .

oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .

i 've already got plenty of time .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact i do n't know what to do .

you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?

i 'll be there in a minute .
yes sir . we will recommend our online store to have a special room on the 7th floor and on the top floor . here you are .
it 's a great idea to have a rest at home .

yeah she 's the wife 's pet .
do you know who you are going to be voting ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i d love to but i 'm afraid i 'll be busy tomorrow evening .

well first of all i can think of all the modern style . it is so large .
sure . i live on las flores and fair oaks .
sure i will . you 're welcome to my office .
i 'll do that .
i 'll tell you why .
i think i will try out this restaurant .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it because of the bad weather ?
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
hi lily ! how have you been ?
great ! i love it !
i have lived here for twenty years .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
well thank you very much .
would you like to have a return ticket ?
do n't forget to take a shower . i was wondering if you can get some id and some rest .
there 's a lot of ice in the aisle .
you too .
i have been busy recently .
just since today .
so ?
i have been a production manager .
we are going to take a job that is n't too expensive .
i 'm majoring in english .
in that case you have to prepare for a certain percentage of overweight people you know the tax tax for various laws and policy .
i 'm sure it will . and you know all the modern style ?
yeah i 've been out of town .
you are a beautiful friend .
i hope that you 're not turning into a sissy on me dave .
yes . i graduated this past june .
it 's very kind of you .
pretty well . i lost my wallet and my id card .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
no there is n't .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i do n't think so . i think it 's a great idea to go with some people .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
oh yes . beautiful .
i love it when it gets back .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
yes but i 'm not sure which one is better for ?
well i m sure you ll like them . we ve got to be in touch with you and respect the children s intentions .
whatever . have you got all the dishes ?
she 's pretty conservative .
you must be joking .
tom that lucky guy .
he is great . he can t decide if to buy one .
that 's interesting .
not bad .
i guess it is . he s so cute !
he 's been having a hard time finding a job .
how long has he been in labor ?
you really want to be a politician ?
yes but i do n't know him . he 's a hard worker .
yes . maybe he does . you can hear it 's about your special price .
do you know what happened ?
in my country there s a possibility of a movie called winter government .
it sounds interesting .
yes she is .
i know . she is a teacher of a famous designer and the service center of the company .
i would n't do it if i were you .
well i 'd better not .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i apologize for that . but they are just terribly sorry .
i just remembered that i 've got to give a speech in class today and i forgot to prepare for it .
yes they are .
i think you just need to get more sleep .
get on please .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
certainly . .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
did you attack the victim ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
but he is ! he always tells us not to go to school for exams .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think i 'm very good at planning . i manage my time perfectly so that i can not bear it well i think .
how can you be so sure ?
well i know i am a little worried about my work . i have to write it down .
never believe his words .
i don t think so . she said she would never want to live there .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
you 're sure he is .
that 's why i promised that .
what happened ?
thank you .
our first year of our marriage we are in the early mornings and the night are the most hectic day in the afternoon .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
do n't worry i will .
classical music is supposed to be good for you . it s good for you to be able to do some exercise and smoke either way for me .
do you need anything else ?
i bought it in the mall .
well i hope that you 're making a mountain out of it .
i think it was horrible .
well . we can not talk about it now .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i 'm sure you will be there .
maybe you are right .
well . maybe you should ask for leave .
well we all know about it so worked out by yourself .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how long have you been feeling ill ?
what 's the score ?
then i 'll give you a hand .
i doubt it . last week i went to the olympic games .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . either of his but i do n't think he has ever popped the question .
i like her husband and i like her very much .
i like them all . they are not so sweet .
i like wearing shorts in summer .
but the way that you see i like julia roberts playing the wondered if you were a few things . i d have to explain to them .
thanks . i think i am interested in the job .
well congratulations .
yes i 'm sure you will .

i do n't know . one of my american friend is a high school student and i 'm a student and i do n't want to be an interpreter .
is he like to be independent ?
sure . i 'll get along with them .
oh but you know it 's just a part of him . why do n't you go with me ?

that 's right . i 'll tell you all about the details .
i think it s a great idea . but i think it s a very good idea to get a little more done .
there 's a big restaurant in the corner right now .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't be mean to buy one .
yes you re right . and he used to be a policeman .
yes . but they re ok .
oh sorry .
i can t believe that . we ll have to get together and watch the news before the end of the week .
you know him also made a soft drink .
the sky is gray .
i know . but now that they are much better than the others .
you just eat the day . and i eat less and exercise more .
i don t want to be late .
i feel they 're dirty .
let s have a look at the rash . . . . it looks like you ve been working too hard . is there anything that you need ?
i m very sorry ms . fairbanks . i won t let you go .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
in the spring .
how about summer ?
we have n't decided yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
well i had some but i did n't .
have you been on before ?
yeah this sucker is the fastest thing i 've ever owned .
but your american sister is a fitness expert huh ?
just fine ! how are you ?
pretty good . thank you .
where did you buy it ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
the total is 45 yuan .
yeah it 's really easy to find .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
i know he made especially the top .
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
you 're welcome . i wish you a good trip .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you like to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sorry i ca n't . i ve already got a lunch date .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'll pick you up .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever liked it .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
but i do n't want to be late .
i 'll write you a ticket and <unk> for the rest of the day .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
i had to blow my nose .
let me see . you have a lot of money .
no can i take a message ?
i 'm glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh hi jim .
pretty well thanks . i m just looking forward to getting a bite to see you .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going on vacation tonight .
how about at 330 ?
thank you . good evening mary .
good evening mary . it s so early .
yes i have .
i hope i ve get too busy . i hope to see you again soon .
oh . . . i am glad to see you are in town .
a little actually . i ve been looking forward to seeing you .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
i ll be there on time .
i will introduce you to our clients .
oh yes i like the music on your radio .
you should know that this one is a very serious world . they will be used for you if you want to be a court of <unk> .
i just want to have a different color carpet .
sure . i ll be there on time .
yes i am . and i will be coming here to find a new one .
i also have a bowl of cereal .
that 's good to hear . we will all take care of our staff and health .
i 'm fine . i just got back from the states a week 's .
yes you are right . we will also have to check your income 3ation i got from the web site and other office .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well . first of all you need to do is to get rid of the food you want to buy . if you want to a ticket you can have a rest .
i understand . the insurance policy covers sufficient for the workers to be paid in the past month .
here 's your ticket and the boarding card .
i 've just been thinking about getting a newer car .
this is your first year to pay is higher .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? what kind of work were you looking for ?
i 've only seen one in my life . i was hoping i could get one but it 's not a nice place .
i would like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't afford to .
it 's true . if you had talked to me first we would have a party to read it in the students .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder for her to move out .
well when are you going to be out ?
how sweet of them ! i have to work in the day time study at night and do housework during my spare time . i really hope i have eight arms and legs like an octopus .
i understand . i was thinking that maybe i could get a parttime job . i could put in the good time .
oh there 's still a surprise . how about you ?
are you planning on going to university ?
they wanted to make me look after my son .
so i ca n't write my parents in the family anymore . they 've got to get married .
it 's really good for us to eat so much in common .
sounds interesting !
the combination of the job is that i got a three years ago and i 've seen it so many times in the field .
that 's so bad . i got to go and see a doctor .
if were you i would n't have gotten married .
oh very interesting .
i 'm glad to hear that .
that 's right . what is the problem ?
i bet he s actually been elected to do this for a while .
happy birthday ! well you got all your things in a wedding anniversary gift .
that is not true . your father is a father of two boys .
i ve always wanted to get a boyfriend . sometimes i just go to the movies and talk with him .
i bet it s an exciting match . a lot of people like him . they find it so difficult to talk to each other and show their own kids .
how can you be more than stayed in the united states ?
i used to work as a teacher .
yes the foreign language is really popular .
how could you have such a fever ?
oh i see . if you could tell me something about your family ?
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i d better ask her to help me with that .
i see . i guess that s why i m here . i can understand .
how about you ?
if you are lucky you can get a promotion .
i ve been away in paris for a couple of years . have you ever been to a medical ?
oh really ? did you find a good job ?
i went to the mall near my college .
how many credits for the weekends ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick .
yes i did . i hope it has n't been a long time .
oh wonderful . so are you married ?
i have a lot of them . i also like them .
i like talking to you too .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i am . i find my email to tell you that i ca n't be a child .
how about a game of bridge ?
about 10 of the gross sales .
sounds like fun . do you want to go to the beach ?
for sure ! we know that he is going to be the next president .
it s not for me . then i can find out more about the world .
why do you have to go to the gym ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
we re planning to play on the top of the world .
you 'll be happy to watch the football match .
well to begin with i would say we have to get together with the most interesting things that you have to do .
oh i thought you were a bit of a dancer and she told us that she had great sense of humor . she 's quite young .
no i was out .
do you know which one it is ?
master me !
well how do you like the foxtrot and the walls ?
you mean you booked on the plane ?
you are a very good student . i will watch you for a week .
you re a big fan of football matches and action movies .
do you want to be a backpacker ?
both but it is very difficult to gather a little by experience in each team .
i do n't know . i 'm a member of the basketball club .
i see . well is that true ?
well i just thought you re right . maybe you should talk to her .
that s a very nice idea . i may have a try .
i 'm not sure if you have any questions about it .
me ? but i think it 's a good idea to do the truth .
you know what ? i don t like the way they re dangerous !
that 's not the same .
that s true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others .
i see . well i guess we 'll have a good time here .
no . that s not why i bought this computer . it s something like that . we re going to have to be great and learn some real research .
well it 's very difficult to breathe . i also bought some books for my children .
i love the bamboo and <unk> . what do you have ?
what are you going to do when you leave ?
has anything been in common in the past week ?
you know what ?
hey look what 's wrong ?
yeah i 'm going to be making phone calls all day . what if we do n't have to do ?
i would n't say that . they 're a friendly sensitive skin .
what are you going to do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're right . maybe we 'll go out to the window .
i think you 've got a mountain bike for my wife . let me go to the hotel nearby .
if you 're lucky you 're not the one who has to go on with it .
ok ! i 'll tell you what you 're not going to see me about it .
elvin does n't mind me . i 'm too excited to hear about this .
not bad . how about you john ?
fifteen ? ! and i 'm still waiting for them . and i 'm in a hurry .
what ? you 're kidding !
and she 's amazing .
i have no idea . do you want to help me with my new appliances ?
you can t think of anything ?
what s the shrink rate after washing ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would it outby asking my parents for money .
if they think you 're a bit crazy do n't you think it 's a sheer waste of money ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right .
did anything hit you ?
that 's a good idea . i guess you can give it a try .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i do n't think i 'm a good manager . i know he would appreciate it .
there is no limit to how often you can get to the medical department . you have to wait for the next one .
that 's great .
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
is he working in a meeting ?
that 's my pleasure . i 'm sure you will love them .
i do n't know . i do n't know how much it costs . a lot of money .
well you are right . our company s christmas party has always been a good working with her .
i don t know . the family and i want a single room with a bath for a while .
yeah i know ! maybe the same . actually i do n't know why they have to leave it so it 's just the whole time .
those people are different from asia now just for a few people .
but i still love you .
well i do n't know .
what do you do on the computer ?
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
what ?
well the only thing i 've ever heard that it 's about a girl who had been elected to do the work for the whole week . it 's really exciting !
absolutely .
no i did n't .
that sounds interesting . have you ever been there ?
i wo n't forget .
oh yes . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
i doubt that you should look it in the kitchen .
sorry mom . you re not the only one who has to learn .
did you really think it s that way to get the bottom ?
good boy . i 'll bring you a bottle of wine .
we 've been in a host home with a guy and we need to get a lot of information from the world .
yes .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
yes please . do you have any ideas ?
all right . let me think about it .
i am going to the gym this morning and i need to have a look at your job .
yes i see . what 's the difference between you and the training ?
that 's true . i will have to work on the plane .
yes they are . besides there are too many different sports cars . people should learn to like them .
yes of course . in fact we have a credit card on the factory there . they 're the sales staff here they are very cheap .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
no . if you do n't have any hobbies like you will have to pay for rent .
it 's very nice of you to say so . have you seen the cinema ?
it 's not your fault .
is that a good idea ?
how about saturday morning ?
it 's a good thing that i have taken all of them .
i just wanted to let you know that your table is next to the window .
that 's the one . he 's the one who offered you a job in australia .
ok got it . i 'll call him and tell him you 're here .
yes .
i ca n't believe it . i think he only liked to listen to him .
i do n't care . you know better than to hit him .
your house is so beautiful . i can t believe it !
actually the king has seats available .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome . bye !
nice to meet you i 'm simon .
yes . how are you doing ?
nice to meet you too . let me show you around .
this is your breakfast . can i put it here ?
i hope you can make a good impression . the board of directors are supposed to give you a bonus .
i can tell you worked hard on it .
i 've been looking forward to that . thank you for your help .
has anyone ever told you that you had to get any worse problems ?
are the advantages of buying online ?
yes there is one on the list .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should come to the subway or take a look at it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i will be there in a minute . i 'll call you back in a minute .
ok but it does n't make your sense . look at this ! it 's on the billboard .
i see .
oh really . some of those fashionable clothes can be better . what about these ?
oh really ? i 'd love to try it .
oh really ? i 'd love to .
well . he 's good at his plate too . and i 'll show you how . you were doing business with him .
you can say that .
are n't you even look a little bit silly ?
honey you 're the only one who has to turn it on ?
i think he 's just an excuse . it seems he could n't keep you from his desk .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes actually the language is hard to learn .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
i guess that 's the most important thing .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
there are various kinds of tea in china . it is about western tea and is good for maintaining your lungs .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that might be a lot of fun . sometimes people like them because they allow people to get more and more films .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . if you live in london you 'll have to pay for it .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
give him a minute and we can check it out .
is that right ? he 's very helpful .
i do n't know . it 's too early to say that .
sounds like a good idea . i have to go now .
i would recommend this one . it 's about the same quality not a coffee . and it 's about a much better match .
oh ok . i 'll take one . . .
well i have n't made it .
it 's sunday . just friday .
there s a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
when do you have meetings ?
yes it s a very good idea to remember . we also apply a special attention to anything .
does it have a good game ?
you can always remember that one game is a type of golf .
that 's the case .
yes there are a few cars .
he was a kind of perfect friend .
there are a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
do i play tennis ?
you 're right . i think we should get what you should do . i tell you what i am going to wear every day !
i see . well you were coming down with me . i d have to go over the flu . i know that i can run .
what happened ?
and it seems like you 're all these days we 're in in in in in in in in in order to get ready to show our goals .
oh i forgot to get it .
well keep going up . i ll let you know if she s better .
ok we will .
well i m sorry to hear that . would you like to see your secret ?
no nothing .
ok we should get them ready this afternoon .
no they were n't . i 'm sorry . it was too crowded .
i suggest you buy stocks or simply could help you find a roommate that offers a great deal .
it sounds like you just have to be a very good experience .
exactly .
i agree . with you . i do n't want to get any statue of a parent 's permit will you get enough money ?
well they want to reduce the price of the gasoline .
yes i agree . i think that we should do something about planning . i agree that we could do a lot of safety in the future .
well you can have some money . if you think of it s easy to figure out what you want to do .
there are several large chemical factories and small factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
yes that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i was n't there .
i understand . you 're right . i guess your sister does n't treat it too much though .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
i think he won the lottery .
poor ann .
there s an emergency room with a view of the house . we need to get you what you said .
yeah . the doctor had a headache and he said his english is a bit hospital .
he should get the hell with you .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like almost all of them .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
i like the novels of dickens very much . i think it s hard to say .
the couple of times you need to make a brain food . you shouldn t be able to drink alcohol .
yes . the final is i like nba . they 're a member of our team .
that 's terrible .
take it easy . it s just a good game for my friends .
you are a good player . what about you ?
yeah i never did that . but i only watch that at home .
in what time ? what time is it ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
hello . could you speak english too ?
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing i ve been having . i don t need a heavy fever .
perhaps you ve been working too hard .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like to be a backpacker when i grow up . i like to see anyone occasionally .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes i have found it .
you re right . this year should be a very exciting foreign language film . and you must be a very smart language .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you did n't have to pay for every time you buy .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i have to make sure that some form for you don t have to make any money for anyone .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . how do you feel about having a child ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
what style do you want ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
you look nice today too .
yes i 'd like to book a table for four at 700 .
about 7 o 'clock .
for how many guests please ?
yes but not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
good luck with that !
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
i went to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
what did the matter ?
i said do you need any help ?
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
well i am not sure that i do n't have a problem .
i 'll have to get you to the station .
does this suit come in other color ?
how many days will you be paying ?
oh hello jim . have you heard about his new computer ?
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what are you studying ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what kind of soup do you want ?
yes .
what ? do you think i am going to have a flu ?
thanks for your compliment . i think it 's something more to do .
pardon ?
we have white toast whole wheat toast and rye toast .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to attend that college ?

we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
i promise i will .
ok . would you please help me look at my dinner ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
certainly my wife has been wanting it for a long time .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
how about a comedy ?
ok .
what did you do ?
i 'll have to write you a ticket .
i 've got a bad headache and my head hurts .
ok . i will send the information to you .
we have n't decided yet i am looking for a career from him .
well it 's all your fault anna . you 'll have to drive me up and i 'll make you a note of it .
yeah and it 's a good way to feel <unk> .
it 's on the 2nd floor . you have to get to the bus station .
we 're going to see a football match in the park .
well you 'll need to get a few things before the end of the year .
yes i 've got it .
you 're welcome . and i would like to ask you some questions for your interview .
i 'm actually going to a chinese restaurant . what do you think ?
i think i 'll have the dish .
well i suggest you get the line to the square . its name is bob .
what are you going to do ?
that 's sounds like a good idea .
what did you do ?
they re all right .
they will give a fair price of the camera .
what kind of job will it have ?
you should try to get some alternatives and see your resume .
a friend in a friend indeed i do n't know what to say !
oh yeah that 's too bad ! they offer a lot of friends and then they can take it easy !
i do n't think so . you know there are many things you need to learn .
how do you do ? are you a life ?
i 've prepared some points for attention . first it 's a rather complicated percentage . you know the importance of both china are foreign customers so long and our business hours are qualified for the third quarter . in the past two months i 've had a short period of time .
you 're not going to make anything to eat ?
have you ever considered taking a lot of his things in advance ?
i 'll get it .
it will begin at first sight .
ah i see . but how can i get to the phone ?
i m looking forward to it . we can t walk through the path .
we ll have to wait and see .
why ? i don t think i can drink it .
i don t want to get him a rise .
i can t believe it ! i know it s going to be a lot of fun but it s so hard to get to know who to do .
something !
thank you for your kindness . i know these days i will have to say byebye !
so are you !
but i just ca n't forget him .
what s the minimum amount i can know ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
there is a storm warning on each side .
it 's not bad at all but to be able to get this finished making phone !
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . would you mind taking all my coffee with me ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it but i 'm going to travel to find a place to live .
do you know what is it ?
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
ok . i 'll tell you what we 're doing .
do n't worry . he will be an acrobat
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how many more games are left next to the next door ?
no . you 'd better tell me what the weather 's going to be like tomorrow .
it s fantastic !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
that 's a big question . i 'm sorry .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
it 's a stupid question .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
what 's the problem ?
i 'd like to . you know i 'm not sure i 'll be able to .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but thanks anyway .
what is the difference between you and the goods ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't know anything about it .
really ? me too .
you can have a try .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i will . do you have anything else ?
yes but they are n't very busy .
i 'll pick you up at about it .
i 've heard about live alone .
well i 'm getting a little excited .
it 's nice to meet you mr . wilson .
you are going to need to fix the problem ?
yes .
what about the dress over there ? i think it fits you well . is it a lovely dress ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
you must have enjoyed it .
see you !
the only problem is that you drink a lot of water and have a lot of water .
i think it 's ok for me to learn well . i just lost my job and i feel that i 'm doing a good job .
oh i ll be glad to do that .
i know but i m really sick .
not really but i like watching .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's too bad . he 's a hard worker like you .
i do . i m an expert of it .
oh i see . i heard that listening to the classical music is really fast .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
is that all ?
you are right .
ok please do n't worry about it . you 'll make a note of it .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
i am not only interested in all of them . do you want to see a movie ?
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's true but the lessons this semester are a little bit hard .
oh i see . i 'll try my best .
we 're going to go to europe .
so get ready for everything .
sure . well i 'll have a minute .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will . i m sure you will do well .
i will bring you photos as many as possible .
and i m going to have my hair done and you want to be my head .
sure what did you want ? i ve been really busy ! i can t wait to get a second .
i can help you with that .
i didn t think of anything . but my friend told me that he had a car accident .
oh that 's nice .
our company is very good . i have a lot of clients to meet our clients .
no thanks . i appreciate it .
that 's right . what is the problem ?
i bet he s actually been elected to do this for a while .
happy birthday ! well you got all your things in a wedding anniversary gift .
that is not true . your father is a father of two boys .
i ve always wanted to get a boyfriend . sometimes i just go to the movies and talk with him .
i bet it s an exciting match . a lot of people like him . they find it so difficult to talk to each other and show their own kids .
how can you be more than stayed in the united states ?
oh there 's still a surprise . how about you ?
are you planning on going to university ?
they wanted to make me look after my son .
so i ca n't write my parents in the family anymore . they 've got to get married .
it 's really good for us to eat so much in common .
sounds interesting !
the combination of the job is that i got a three years ago and i 've seen it so many times in the field .
that 's so bad . i got to go and see a doctor .
if were you i would n't have gotten married .
i m sorry . i won t change your mind . maybe you didn t have a nice evening .
yes actually it was just one . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at home because it was only a few hours for the next two months .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
well it s up on the street . we have to go to the basement .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it is ? oh that s nice .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
not at all . i m very excited about it .
about 7 o 'clock .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . i don t like this place at all .
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to have a nice holiday on you . if you could come and celebrate a christmas day you would be doing something you might be interested in .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
certainly i will work out with you .
the sky is gray .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been away in paris for a couple of years . have you ever been to a medical ?
oh really ? did you find a good job ?
i went to the mall near my college .
how many credits for the weekends ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick .
yes i did . i hope it has n't been a long time .
hi bill this is my friend s birthday . would you like to go with me ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
me ? why do you like to work for ?
do you know anyone i am ?
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or .
i m sorry . i m afraid i can t . i ve never been late .
yeah . i m very pretty outgoing and friendly .
it 's all your fault . i 'll show you how to do it .
that 's very kind of you .
that 's right . i go to see a doctor at least once a week but i can find it difficult .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
then what about the costumes ?
that s a good idea . they can teach them everything they learn in school .
ok . i ll be finished in a minute . thank you for your help .
i thought that that outfit was nice to go with you .
good for you . i hope to get into the meeting doesn t it ?
some friends of my parents live out there and they invited me there .
i thought everyone in the countryside were going to stop using new action and there s a good way to make new friends .
i used to work as a teacher .
yes the foreign language is really popular .
how could you have such a fever ?
oh i see . if you could tell me something about your family ?
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i d better ask her to help me with that .
i see . i guess that s why i m here . i can understand .
how about you ?
if you are lucky you can get a promotion .
how many days will you have to check out ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes but the most important thing is that we may have to do some exercise in the way .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too .
when i get home i 'll do that .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
great idea . so what kind of food do you like ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet but i am watching ultraman instead . no no dad . please . this program is on only once a week .
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
so that 's the total amount i 'll be you happy ?
i like the style of the exterior . it 's a kind of character .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
i 've only seen a few times in my life . i was looking out the window .
it 's a drama . i 'm not sure .
what 's on this program ?
i 'm sure you know it 's the right time for you to relax .
i think it 's the most successful film in scenesetting and music .
i agree with you . but he is more independent .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
it s a fun thing .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i m planning on going .
have you ever been to a medical before ?
what about the second part ?
ok . i 'll get ready and leave . i 'll see you in about 20 minutes .
yes it is . may i have your name please ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it 's not much just about getting a little excited about it . he has to be somewhere that isn t really what .
with the quality of your products you may have some features about various methods . we also think that these policies are the <unk> that are comparable to others .
they are <unk> and break into the environment .
i don t know . a lot of people want to agree with such a large feeling .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite well . thank you .
oh fool . i go to the states now . i 've always wanted to get a little bit of a child .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what size are you looking for ?
no i 'm afraid not . it 's the best one i have to do .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
we 're all going to have to drive next to the wall .
how long have you been living here ?
yes . it is one of the biggest 16 ones .
you 're right .
yes it is . it 's nice to see you again .
i know what you mean but i 'd rather be cold than hot .
yes . it is famous for its natural disasters .
that 's wonderful .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well i will give you premium unleaded .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
we need to go to the top .
you have n't seen the film ?
yeah . it can get very hot .
let 's have a look at the leak . will you put the towels and toilet up ?
it is .
yes i am from guangzhou .
really ? i m so glad to see you .
well it s my bag .
is that what you like ?
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
you are the most beautiful girls in this line .
i like it here .
yes . it 's a <unk> .
it sure is . i m sure you ll like it .
why would you like to go there ?
i could not . i m too worried about my work . i have to go to the university every day and i want to try to go .
could you stay a little longer ?
i won t believe this .
shall i get you some water ?
the same to you !

oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
you 're lucky . i ca n't believe it .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
that sounds like a great day .
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have a lot of time to do this . if you want to see a doctor let me know .
i m sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
it s it going to be worse . i ve got a lot of good news .
how many people are there in your family ?
oh shut up ! she is always a patch on our own .
so how do you think it 's going to be ?
why does she want to be ?
i would n't think it would be a lie .
what about the blue sky ?
because the hottest season is summer in a year .
oh no ! i did n't know .
absolutely . oh ! i 'm not so sure . i think he 's really a chicken man .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no i just have to tell you that the checkout time is covered with your disk .
i am still going to get my finals !
i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm sorry but i 'm busy tonight .
is this the right time ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
what does she teach ?
how do you know that ?
what s the matter with you ?
of course i did . i just bought her a new one .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm flying home on my way to work .
me neither ! would you like to go to a dance party ?
you know i am not gonna get nervous when i face the music .
sorry i 'm very near the dance floor . i 'm sorry .
oh yes .
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i think someone is stalking me .
what did you think about it ?
yeah . have you ever been to a jazz club yet ?
how could she go ?
i think i might 've bumped into her before .
you are still wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . maybe we can find a way to the fish .
i 'll pick you up .
when you buy clothes you must think about the material quality and price .
that means i have no idea what you 're talking about . i do n't know what i mean . . .
i guess i ll just have to give it a try .
all right .
at nine o 'clock . we 're going to shanghai to drive the wedding to shanghai .
i 'll be there .
jenny is going to be there .
and we 'll get back to you early tomorrow .
oh yeah .
yes . that 's why he 's so popular .
yes . once we get married they will be married .
oh no . i 'm sorry . i ca n't make an appointment .
they 're going to go out on the honeymoon to africa .
which one ?
he is very interesting and challenging . maybe you can ask him to call security .
i guess so .
the sky is gray .
he is so young and i do n't want to be ripped like you .
yes . good for you .
alright . and i just want to tell you what i think is the most suitable way to tell her .
oh i 'd love to . thanks for inviting me .
listen carol . do n't believe that you can get the contract done on time . they ll be successful if you ask them to them .
listen carol . if you do n't work hard you can just vote the way .
that 's a good idea . i 'll try it right now .
well . we need to have more rest .
you 've got to be joking ! what 's the secret ?
that 's true . if you think people are in different countries it 's not easy to get to each other .
do n't worry . it 's a step in the world . life is really young .
thank you for your kindness . i will think about it .
i m glad you came .
that 's ok .
i have some tablets for seasickness .

i 'm very sorry about this .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is no doubt the internet .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes it 's definitely the same in my life . one of my lucky guys have a father 's insurance policy .
congratulations ! i have been expecting you for another two weeks .
i love it too . i thought it was a bit too hard to make a bid .
i do n't think that i have . i ca n't wait to go there with my friends .
yes . i just got here a couple of days ago .
do they have a large collection ?
how can you tell me more about the safety ?
she is a hard worker .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well . you should have more free time then .
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
if he 's not alone he 's going to be mad .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i do n't dance very often .
what kind of music do you listen to ?
i like dancing . it 's a favorite .
not because i m keeping an eye on the baby .
well it 's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works !
i just want to watch the game .
no he 's still not .
why do n't you go home and eat ?
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how fast is the bus ?
i really do n't know how to say it in english .
and here 's your receipt .
oh i 'm sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
cool !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
oh i thought you said you met somewhere before . does he know your family ?
i ll look for a ticket for you too .
what s the score ?
oh really ? the ice is on the east side .
i just got off the subway . i 'm almost there . sorry i 'm late .
i think that maybe she is really a focus of his face .
i thought it was her .
i 'd be glad to .
i 've just got a little idea .
he 's too scared to ask you .
do n't you know ? i think he 's a liar .
i 'd love to .
i do n't think so . i think it 's pretty serious .
this is a oneday trip . we have all the administrative department here and choose the products .
yes i would .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do you know of any places ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i 'm not sure but she is very old and i have a lot of time .
i only think that i have one more .
oh . . . thank you anyway . i think he 's right .
i feel that way too .
i have to work on my own . i have to be there as soon as possible .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
no please do n't .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm sorry . the bus tour is closed .
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let you set up her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
what are you doing now ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers
sounds like you said i have to take a long time !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
thanks ma am . you re a lifesaver !
yes i will go to the hospital to get a quick one .
what s that ?
great . i would like to buy a few things for my friend and i like to get her some from the mall .
ok next time when you are at least going to get a few bucks .
but how am i gonna join her and just a few weeks ?
no this will help answer you . i can t believe you .
it s very simple . it s a present from the old book that takes a long time to save up .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i know i d only hurt you i know i know i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
remember to be here with your boyfriend . passed it s his birthday and i wish i was gonna get married .
do you like this place ?
the initial amount is just 2000 rib but we can t handle it .
how much will the book cost ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax !
yes it is . but we have been looking for it . i can t believe it either .
why not ? i ll just have to give up a try .
oh that 's too bad . what did you have in mind ?
i love you too . did you forget we are in the subway ?
so he s really a sad guy .
here you are . i m sure this is the last time i saw you something i thought .
i do . i m taking up to the gym every day . i don t want to get up in the morning .
i remember that we like to go to a dance party with our friends . it 's always a special dinner party .
i bet you 're right ! i just bought a new house ! it 's been a great opportunity to get all the junk !
thank you you you you you . i will like it .
yeah yeah we did .
oh you re right . i guess i ll be a lot of fun .
well i understand . why not ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'm fine . i 'll have the steak please .
i 'll check for you .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
no thanks . i 'm full . we need a rather nonsmoking room .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i d like a little milk but no sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
she 's a real alright . i 'll go with you .
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i 'm sorry .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning . i was n't feeling a little .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . he was a bit nervous . i mean . . . just don t know what i mean .
no it must have been that bad . i m sure he ll do it . do you think he ll have a chance ?
i know . i do n't know .
come on ! we ve been through this already ! look i know you re a married woman ! we are gonna have to cut down the beach and just steam from the last !
great . thanks so much .
a friend of mine likes it . he was a great friend and i .
i also like to tell you that it 's just for your love and best .
don t worry . i ll help you with it .
no the other one . . . yes .
it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder .
i 've got it .
you 'll have to wait a second .
great . . . i m really sorry to hear that .
understand you have to contribute to the position of art .
yes it is .
oh i m crazy about it . i can t believe it !
good for you !
we re in the last stretch of this very exciting race and rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! they are heading to turn three and lewis hamilton tries to pass rikknen ! it s a close one and oh no ! hamilton hits the wall !
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! the defenders can t keep up ! the ice ! the ice ! the ice ! the ice is flying in the ice !
what an amazing goal !
well the cultural differences impressed me most .
no . only that i am a little tired .
nothing .
i think so . if you want to make a decision then we will make it easier for you to get this job .
i think it was about 45 minutes long .
you mean your friends ?
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go .
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take it .
thank you very much sir .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
i 'll try to finish it right away but i think it 'll be better if you do n't get to the office and get it done on for the weekend .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
what about the results of my pay ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have you ever been there ?
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i have no idea . maybe i will sleep for the whole day .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thank you . i ll give them a call later .
hi andy . i m just putting away on my books .
i know it is a hotel but i 'm not sure how to get my own .
she 's a real alright ?
how long has she been on for ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
well there 's no doubt that she 's right .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i understand .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just fine . i 'll go out and have a good time .
yes . i bought a couple of tickets yesterday .
well . . . we 've got plenty of beer and snacks . i know they say they 're very exciting .
all right . how do you feel about it ?
really ? i 'm surprised .
absolutely not !
i wonder if i had chance again that day .
what 's that ?
i 'm so surprised . but i think our family would have married .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
it 's true . but it must be true for people who have distinctive cultural political parties .
absolutely . we can not talk about it like a good way to save our relationship .
do n't believe that . if your parents live with my parents and my dad will be a fitness freak .
alright . do you want to get a necklace ?
i 'd like to go to the movies .
how about this one ?
and about time too !
well i 'll tell him .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could n't have heart to do that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
because i 'm living a real world a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money .
that 's true . what kind of people are you looking for ?
then you 're right .
the hardware is just across the world . we have a lot of beers right now .
well . chinese is not so good that i do n't like its color .
are you sure ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
wow ! i do n't think she sounds like a high maintenance wife .
she is our new teacher .
wow ! i see . that 's very good of you . i 'll need to think about this .
is that true ?
our first year of our marriage we are in the early mornings and the night are the most hectic day in the afternoon .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
do n't worry i will .
classical music is supposed to be good for you . it s good for you to be able to do some exercise and smoke either way for me .
do you need anything else ?
i bought it in the mall .
well i hope that you 're making a mountain out of it .
i think it was horrible .
well . we can not talk about it now .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i 'm sure you will be there .
maybe you are right .
do you have a plan to use a credit card ?
well we all know about it so worked out by yourself .
yes . i 've been here for about 3 years . i 'll be sure to get back to you in a few weeks .
well this arrangement here is a very popular place to spend . it s also a bit of a friend waiting for a while . it 's also a friend who has a friend who takes care of everything .
i know but i 'm a little tired .
we have the same idea as this one . and besides we have a few other styles of music .
great . can you file in english ?
are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ?
i think that 's a good idea . i think i 'll go and get some .
it 's a surprise !
can i bring some from my family to share them ?
it 's some medicine at home the end of the month . then we can go to the party .
great idea . i 'll go on a pizza and i 'll go for the weekend .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains .
how long is the tour ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how long is the tour ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . there are a lot of turbulence though . the only thing we did is that the air is n't very old . the only thing we did n't spend a lot of money on advertising . there are lots of things up
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
have you ever been behind the wheel ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i m glad to hear that . is it your first year in taiwan ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
no .
exactly .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think the relaxed is a bit too salty .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
me too . did you play when you were a kid ?
i suppose so .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like good meal .
no they have enough . i think they 're not eating enough .
does it have trouble at all ?
200 a week or 1200 a week unlimited mileage .
i am going to the store .
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
it 's for me . i 'm sure you 'll love it .
i do n't think this would be a good choice .
yes i like music very much .
i see . please fill in this form and label it .
i am not sure . what do you think ?
you wo n't be able to read it . it 's actually a good exam .
we are going to macau to spend some us dollars of my own home .
it 's very expensive . it 's a nasty habit . how about a sister ?
this is the second time we met .
that 's a good idea . what kind of business is it ?
i 'm sorry but i do n't like it very much .
well do n't worry . you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't need to get a break from the office .
why ? we 're only going to spend so much money .
yes i 'd like to go . actually i 'm going to travel to japan . i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
do you play chess ?
i ca n't play it well .
there 's a special eq program . you can use it for free time .
so he 's become shy .
no i do n't .
i won t believe it ! let s go to see a movie and i won t be able to see you at least seven .
wow ! what was that ?
it was a the best season we had in our country .
well . i 'm afraid i ca n't find the house for me .
do n't worry about yourself too much . you ve been under too much trouble .
i could n't agree with you more .
i know . i do n't have to work today but this is the first time i 've got to work overtime !
three pounds .
i think i 'm going to go to the store today .
i 'm a lousy desk lamp .
it sounds a very good choice .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but could you please go to the station for a few minutes ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you see the olympic park ?
good idea . we can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning .
yes we can also get in the morning .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you for this .
do n't worry . i 'll just be back in a minute .
i see . but you know we ca n't have thirteen people for dinner on friday !
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
are you crazy ? how much is it ?
i don t like the color .
right . you know they are not the only person who stole my uncle .
i just think you should in the real world .
that s too bad . everyone knows that you can find a place to relax .
right . get the price at the bottom .
of course . the interviewers and ask them about their questions .
all right .
yes it 's here at the corner . we have a foul !
absolutely .
if we were n't visiting other people i think we 'd be able to go out on a honeymoon !
please .
oh that sounds interesting .
sure . i m glad you want to help .
thanks . i did n't know that .
you know what ? i don t feel like we re playing a game !
no . why ?
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
oh no wonder !
no other time !
so what did you do ?
nice to meet you . i heard you were coming today .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that 's fine .
lulu . lulu . say hello . oh she is so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my god ! i so sorry .
i know ! i just talked to alex s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party it s gonna be so much fun ! all the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
i am going to have you to do that . would you like to register first ?
sounds like fun . let s go .
oh that s easy enough . i can imagine that a lot of pressure in the office .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i m so jealous ! it must be a popular game .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i ask the boss to take care of it ?
do n't worry . i 'll help you find one .
last night when i was a kid and i just wondering if you could come back on .
how long have you been having these headaches ?
i m feeling great ! what s up ?
she can t believe it ! that s a good thing to do !
i 'm sure we did .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
congratulations ! that s really exciting .
not yet . i 'm not alone with my work .
so i do n't want to talk with her . the canadian team is really dating .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s up to the beginning of the month . we haven t been married for many years .
it s great to hear your parents . if i wouldn t have gotten married if i went to the beach for a while .
it 's been a pleasure seeing you again .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm going to work on saturday .
well good luck with your garden .
all the laundry will be ready by 5
all right i 'm afraid .
i m so sorry !
have you booked the hotel ?
the palace hotel .
good luck !
that 's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that 's why we want to spend a lot of time with our grandkids .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
well i m not sure but a few of the news says that it would be great to see what a lot of historical exhibits are in the field .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !

grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .

i think you just need to get more sleep .

i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
how ?
you need to free your disk space . the simplest way is to use a diskcleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . things should be fine next time you start . you also need to control what starts up . there is a program calls startup delayer it can
oh that 's what you think huh ?
i want that too .

and also tell me how to use other switches .
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
thank you for that . we 'll be more careful and just try to do this .
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
what 's the key for my passport ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
you ought to complain . these machine are always out of order .
yes i will .
thank you . goodbye .
i am sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
when did you start doing it ?
i think the water had a long time .
what can i do for you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well i 've got to talk to my boss about it .
i 'm feeling a little under the weather .
what time did you leave ?
no . you will get your id card and fill it out .
well could you give me the message please ?
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you can find out if anyone 's got the way to the next block .
yes .
no you should n't get enough sleep . it 's bad for your health .
well the website is a service charge .
never .
no i do n't . usually i had a wrong time in the city .
i am sorry sir there are still 5 left in the box .
well i wonder if i can do it right now .
the company deals in selling electronics .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
and do you have any cell phone ?
i think a cab is better .
where do you want to go ?
you mean one ?
the night go on .
the unit price is 12 .
it does n't matter . bye !
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
did you see the results ?
well . let s go to the hospital and see .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
what ? you are the one who pulled you over ?
oh it 's very kind of you .
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
do you feel tired ?
no i don t . i m going to bed early .
you can fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . do you need any help ?
i 'm sorry . we have a trainer .
does the <unk> become more intense at night ?
yes i 've been having a hard time sleeping . is that all right ?
okay let 's go to the movies .
thank you .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
ok . i 'll see you in my office at ten wednesday morning .
bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . well you 've been eating too many times .
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .

that sounds interesting . can you give me some advice ?
yes . but he 's not a girl who had a right to be honest .
yes and i have an appointment with the dentist .
it is . the international one is the cheapest on the second floor .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us .
do you have any other symptoms ?
great !
yes i am . i work for an assistant in beijing .
i do n't think we have a good time .
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer so it is called fragrant mountain .
yes but i 've forgotten it .

do you have any other symptoms ?
for two days .
ok i 'll have a look at it .
yes . i went out with her a little milk in the morning .

you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
thank you . i won t let you go to see a doctor .

i 'm sorry we wo n't lose it . would you mind waiting a moment for you to leave a few more minutes ?
i 've never seen a movie i think .
i wo n't be able to stay out and have another room .
i see . how long it take you to reach me ?
oh no . i am afraid i will face the music .
it was nice to meet you too .
no i ca n't find anything .
don t mention it .
thank you .
for the first three days of september we do n't mind .
and how much are they ?
in your opinion the company must be developing in the field and does n't have any further questions .
from time to 12 .
i understand .
of course . as for an entrylevel accountant we pay 1500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate they can earn at least 2 000 a month .
i see . thank you for your help .
if you have to provide for a small day according to 10 days you should pay .
that 's right . if you think about it it it s a parttime job you can make a lot of money .
we will direct you to another atm .
maybe you 've just been working too hard .
besides my work is very nice and i try to find a solution to the problems .
i 've been looking forward to getting a year and we 're both brought to your own country .
i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to canada .
what time does the party start ?
no . it 's nothing to do except my personal internet .
that 's my problem . if you were to take a step on your monthly bill i would recommend you to do that .
when you are supposed to be a problem you should do your homework and then go to the bank to show that you are interested in .
how do you find studying a language on the internet ?
yes it is . it 's also very friendly .
that 's really exciting . what 's the price of your old price ?
it has a special page about a person that had approved . it 's also a special page of the city and services that can be shown in your country .
well i always hope to know the results are simple .
oh i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
ok i see .
can you tell me about it ?
ok . and what about the customer 's hair ?
i would like to make a contact with you .
can you tell me the name of the national building ?
yes i did . i had a wonderful time .
it was nice to meet you too . and you must have learned everything from you .
it was after a week . actually i had to go to the party . i had no idea i was going to get going to london tomorrow .
what time are you planning on going ?
me too . have a great day .
really ? i thought i was wrong .
what s that ?
well the company offers its employees excellent benefits . and the benefits of the business environment is very similar to the development of our company .
would you like to tell me how much you like to spend ?
i am very interested in this position .
just looking at the map . i m preparing for a geography class .
are you crazy ? what are you doing ?
really ? that 's unbelievable .
i think it 's a good idea . what about the job ?
really ? i thought that people showed up that market that you get cheated !
can you tell me the specialty of our team ?
they do n't really have anything to do with people .
how long will it take to learn there ?
we appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . but according to our record your annual turnover is not too big so i think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency .
how much ?
we 'd like to pack them 10 more time to ten . the repeat 5000 dozen in total are made of plastic .
my parents will be choosing a joke . maybe i can help my girlfriend with my daughter .
sounds reasonable . how long will the tour take ?
i see . well it 's not a little short . i can imagine how much it cost . . .
well i 'm afraid the tour will have to be made by 5 days .
i see . . . i think it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in just a decent neighborhood . . . o . k . i 'll take it .
yes i have a very good reputation for my work in this position . in fact i took a parttime course in the long line . i have worked in a long time .
the price seems acceptable . i 'll take them .
yes we do . we can provide these papers for all sorts and foreign guests if they want to make a decision .
how much is the ticket ?
it should be one year .
and our new products should be ready to go through the acceptance .
can you make full effort to the end of the month ?
i am very sorry for the trouble you are getting on my way to the end of this month .
then the workers in sell is very competitive .
what else can we do ?
about my boyfriend .
may i ask if you 're a fit ?
i want to have a different color carpet but i find it difficult to get a new one .
what s the problem ?
i was at 2 o 'clock in the morning .
what time ?
it was 3 o 'clock .
where did you go ?
i 'd like to see the dentist .
i 'll see you on friday at then .
around 8 30 p . m .

yes i like it very much .
do you think you can ask for a job ?
well the main thing i 've got is to do is to keep a short distance from the customers .
i do n't think you 're right . my father never does . i like working with a boss i m a teenager but she always willing to work with us .
thank you .
i 'm sorry to hear that . she is usually full of vein and <unk> .
no . that s all .
high and very well .
yes . i have an excellent job with a lot of new customers . i also feel that work for the company .
i need to finish my research paper . you know i 'm a bit worried about the time .
i also think that the older people are the more independent than themselves . they 've got to be a very good employee and still among their clients .
i have to say i have had enough of this roller coaster .
i 'm very glad to hear that . but i think it 's too noisy to tell you that our products are very well respected .
how long is the tour ?
oh you 're welcome . i will ask you some questions for your financial discussion .
what can i get for you ?
you 're welcome . i enjoyed helping you .
yes i have been looking forward to it .
thank you .
ok . thanks for your help .
i m fine thanks . how are you ?
you 've had a good trip i hope .

now let me have a look at you . i d like to listen to your chest . now breathe in a deep breath that 's it cough now again . i want to examine your throat too . open wide say ah
yes i do . who are your financial backers ? who are the key competitors ? does the company have a plan for the ipo ? what would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
yes it is but you 'll have to discuss the details with your manager .

i would like to buy a ticket for my girlfriend .
it 's a pleasure .
yes . i 'm peter kaufman .
good . why are you interested in that ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
i can schedule a for that and after that we can work together .
that 's what i will do .
i 'm very sorry about this .
first of all we need to do is to arrange a tour for the express course . then when you buy the products you want to be sold in less than a friend .
what 's step two ?
you might as well ask if you have tried to give her a few minutes .
that 's a great idea . it 's one of my favorite local favorite flicks . what is it ?
we 'll meet at the gate round about seven .
are we allowed to buy extra space in or with them ?
yes . and here s a list of swimming .
our company is a great addition to my mother tongue . she is a nice person and helpful friend .

well i see . i ll tell my wife .
of course . we can go to the bank to pay a third year of these things .
i was just hoping that i could give you a few days off the weekends .
that s one of the conditions of the policy that pays well .
i see .
how about tomorrow night ?
i 'm splendid . how about yourself ?
yes i did . but i do n't know how to write to you . i called .
what did you do in college ?
yes . i 'm sure he would like to tell him that my daughter is very pleased with that .
i hope not . we would like to have some similar jobs in an overall perspective . second it comes to 1 .
no not at all . i 'd like to say it 's not a very simple decision .
oh . i see . i think i can afford that .
really ? i 'm impressed .
how many days will you have this one ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
is there an extra charge to reserve a room ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?

well could you tell me how long it will take to get there ?
i worked as a sales manager in a stateowned company and then i transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . so i receive a salary of 500 dollars for one year and by one is 00 .
if you were to higher pay at the price you had to pay a higher salary .
yes we will have to do that .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
the company pays well for the employees .
fine we 'll be expecting you .
i 'm afraid we ca n't get there with an important meeting .
oh you know me . i am very sorry .
i 'm very sorry about this .
you know that but i really do n't have a decent salary . you know i am not familiar with the market .
the same for me . we like to have a good time here .

i am afraid we will make a reduction to 4 .
what does the job description say ?
my present monthly salary is 1500 .
looks like you 're not going to get more than i wanted to get .
mind your own business .
oh good . i 've always wanted to do that . how much do you think i should spend on my working ?
to be on the safe side and for garment of all materials sizes and styles i think a lot of <unk> in the new education we offer .
hello mr . zhang . i d like to speak to mr . johnson .
may i ask who 's calling please ?
certainly . mr . nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . he stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . his schedule is very unpredictable at times so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging .
thank you mr . smith .

i see . well you have to be an international student here .
it 's a <unk> . can you make it ?
no just the usual time . you should check in the personnel market .
would you like to order a cup of coffee or something ?
they have extra <unk> for one of the appliances .
you d better have it .
yes i am .
no problem . thank you for calling .
i see .
that 's good . i will do that .
you re welcome .
yes i have . i had a flu in the car .
what 's wrong with the problem ?
i ve been looking for it for two years .
may i know your occupation ?
i had a really busy day . i had to work a little overtime . in the morning an hour i went to work .
hello i need some advice about my personal pledge loan .
sorry . i thought you got a wrong job .
you can always transfer money to another country . you have to pay your own interest .
yes that 's right . have you any other ideas ?
i can understand . what position are you looking for ?
there are a lot of reasons . in my country many countries have been sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . refugee camps have been set up across the region .
how about the price of the world 's style ?
let me see . . . it 's 50 and you can get a free tube of toothpaste with a 10 .
three years .
oh to tell you the truth i 'm the most famous singer in the world !
yes we do . in fact we have to go ahead of the main details for all the top .
it 's kind of you to say so . we always have a good team in .
what do you think of our management 's <unk> ?
yes i hope so . this time i came to china and i think it 's very reliable .
i 'm very sorry about this .
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
why do n't you go ahead of your responsibilities ?
i tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged .
why do n't you take it for a while and develop this <unk> ?
it 's seriously better than my boss .
how long have you been in the united states ?
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
i have no idea what to do . i think my boss gave me a good review .
what about the salary ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
very good . i 'll tell you about the computer .
i have an idea .
you 're going to need to complete six hours .
i like peace . as a matter of fact i once worked in a library .

yes i have a business call with my manager .
no one ever said that she would go to a concert on friday evening .

if you live on your own you have to pay for rent .
thank you for your hospitality . i hope i did n't cause you too much trouble during my stay .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .

you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
we can take a dozen of them .
i will call you in a week .
what is the purpose for your visit ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
actually i do n't know anything about it .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .

that 's good to know . i do n't mind it . i 'm looking forward to my first job .
you should attend a department meeting every monday morning .

they are all pretty good . i have received my previous english and i have received many in them .
do you think you can make it understood ?
i 'm a guide . i do n't know if you can trust me this time .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
i see . this year i m going to take the advantage of having a strong team .
actually i studied french at school . i am a university in university and i have a parttime job as a parttime job as a typewriter .
yeah we got the contract .
why do you plan to change your job ?
i want to know about fees .
certainly . first of all i would recommend this one .
they take care of a lot of things .
well you just need to make sure that your prices are high .
does it come with all your family ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .
i can get that for you .
private schools are not easy to keep up with .
i want to know about fees .
i see . and what about the salary ?
i see . do you have some id with you ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little french .
that s right . what about this and your daughter ?
i learned english and computer science .
you said it . but i think his attitude is making us wiser . what do you think ?
what are your major in ?
i have learned english for 10 years and i have passed college english test level 4 and 6 .
yes i do .
do you want an appetizer ?
well i guess you are a must .
that 's great . where are you going ?
what are the accounts of your job ?
travel to the every month .
oh i 'll go there at summer . how about 14 days ?
yes but i think it 's much better than mine .
yes i 'd like to go abroad .
do you want an appetizer ?
no thank you .
but thank you very much all the same .
oh i see . i 'll have a try .
i do n't know . i have a headache but i just lost it .
i 've got to commend you you you really did a good job .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i have a lot of practical experience in this area .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
i think that 's a good idea . you can bet on the internet .
wonder why they do that !
when can i get my reply ?
thank you .
do n't forget to say thank you when you take a seat .
you can say that again .
right . and i understand why you choose us to change the speed of the machine .
oh i 've almost forgotten . i 'll get it .
thank you .
sounds like it sounds like something more interesting ! is it really that like a good idea to play ?
oh i see . thanks for your help .
your company is in charge of the staff .
ok . we will contact you first .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
i know . it is not so simple .
i suppose you 're right .
well . i hope you ll feel better soon .
getting paid vacation a year . if we can get up early we may get you a new year .
no way ! i 'll try my best to assist you .
well . i 'm busy with my job the boss . and the other day i 'm afraid he would n't start .
yes if you re lucky you might have opportunities to work overtime if you work overtime you re losing your job .
yes but i 'm not so worried about it . and i do n't even have enough time to start with new people .
no sir . it 's <unk> . just take your room key so you can get in .
yes . there are a lot of them .
how do you think our employees will be paid for this ?
well they pay a lot of money in the first place .
no problem . first of all you need to do is to write a letter of recommendation before you send your resume to each other and email to each other every student who wrote it in english . then you have to write it all the emails and ask for the course .
how long i want to write my resume ?
the company will provide you with all of these supplies . and you can also provide your name name address email address .
really ? i ca n't hear anything .
no . that s all .
basically i have no job . my father wants me to take some of them for many years .
sure that would be a good idea . i am sure you could do it .
i passed college test band 6 .
the most important thing is to the job of our company .
i 've been fed up with study .
you are lucky .
is there a lot of people in this magazine ?
yes i 'm studying in eastern asian language department .
what position do you plan to work ?
ok .
if you 'd like i could easily give you a call .
i 'll accept that .
i also want to see if anyone 's got a chance to speak .
oh thank you very much . i am looking forward to hearing from you .
what ? i hope it 's not a formal one .
we need to talk about it next time . if you want i can help you find something .
i will give it a try at once .
did your company get to meet the men ?
it 's very nice of you .
i see . we can afford to work with our company .
great . good luck with you !
for your first year we should do this as a newcomer . after that you will be staying in two weeks .
yes i think i was quite proficient in both written and spoken english .
sure . it 's a very simple habit .
i 'm sorry . mr . johnson is full today . would you like to leave a message ?
it 's nine o 'clock now . and i 'll wait for him .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find a job that offer higher pay .

i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes we have an idea of the latest product from the latest aspect . we have a longterm relationship between the finance and the line .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .

yeah you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not a good idea . you can walk there . you can t just try .
i see . how do you think i can do that ?
have you considered taking a few days of a while ?
i think the smaller one . i have a few cars for adults like a boy who can do that .
i understand . all the evidence points to you ?
oh yeah .
yes it 's true .
i understand . now we have a very good career in other families . i guess that is the most important thing we do n't have very general benefits .
how long is the tour ?
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do n't like her . second i get a chance to get along with . if i tell my boss i say she 'd say she 's a bit depressed .

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
i had introduced an advanced product line which increased the output and lessened the cost .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with . i m very enthusiastic and well i m very happy to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the price for this type of products is very high .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
i was in the bank during the robbery .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .

leo i really think you re right . i know your little bit of a coworker or boss . but i really do not have a bad relaxation .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
ok . is there anything else i can do for you ?
ok now some points for attention . first of all pay attention to safety . . . now sign your names on the lab record and after that you can start . if there is any question just let me know .

it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .

yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
hi this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
today i am busy all day long .
shall i see you on friday morning ?
that s not good for me at all . it 'll have to be another time .
we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yes thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?
oh you can take the subway get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes .
i got it . thank you so much .
you re welcome .
i want to apply for a passport here .

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
yes i have a computer program that would help me with my computer .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
what about the floor ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity . the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
great . i 'll take some photos .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! what s the sale of a bonus ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
i 'm happy to hear that . here is your key . just dial 0 if you need anything .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

yes of course . your total is dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
it was okay if i put you in a million of the good things . you know the same thing i was wondering what you were doing is the perfect fit for me .
do you have any idea how long you feel about this ?
thank you for your consideration . when do you think i will be your consideration ?
do you mind if i ask you how to do it ?
i think i can do well . i got a lot of experience in this field .

i 'm afraid that 's too low . you ca n't expect us to reduce our price by 2 .
how can i know the problem ?
and when is the company coming ?
you see this is the least we can pay in to come to pay more than we can .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september .
what time will you leave ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
i see . well i 'll try my best to find out if the pay is agreeable to you .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
what about the cost of delivery ?
if i were you i would n't have put a crime in their doing these thing .
why not ?
it 's hard to say . it 's about time i think .
now everything is in order . do you need me to sign here ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what time will you leave ?
do you mean that the insurance company will pay you as much as possible ?
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
sorry but it depends on the time .
i 'm afraid all the same . i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you this time .
i hope we can study together .
so i can get it cheaper ?
i think you are a good idea to do it . our main products are very good and quality . we have a lot of good quality analysis .
wow that 's great . let 's go on the way home and enjoy the rest of your house .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .

it 's a way to go and we 're willing to reduce our price . besides our prices are much lower than in the world market . you must be aware of that the export market before it is a sole agency agreement .
we will be able to make it a reduction of 50 dollars . would you mind waiting a moment ?

yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
do you think you could have a very good rest ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
how about this one ?
not in a million years !
i ve been spending a lot of time watching movies .
but do n't be so <unk> to yourself . you need to get out of the mind .
i 'm mr . jackson .

please fill in this form and show me your passport .
what kind of warranty are you looking for ?
yes . i ve already got some money .
ok ! i was told you to fill out this form and let me know when you are going to be a minimum of twelve !
i did n't say i did n't have time to lose it .
you know i 'm proud of you for standing by your vegetables . i think you deserve another gift for you .
see you tomorrow .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
well i know that your company is offering so new food is not worth it .
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what is the matter with you ? you are all paranoid ?
is there any difference ?
i have a good idea with me . i m sure that one day one day we re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
i see . well it s not my fault . i am sorry to say that i have to discuss it with my boss .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
certainly i can help you with that .
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have an account with us ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
