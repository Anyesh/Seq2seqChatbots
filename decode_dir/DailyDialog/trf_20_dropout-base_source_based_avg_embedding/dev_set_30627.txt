they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .

definitely ! i was born in shanghai and went to a small restaurant with my parents last year .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
yes i have some foreign currency to declare .

you bet . the view is wonderful .
maybe we could get a few new furniture .
i have a menu from the mall .
i love it .
i m glad to see you too .
it depends on the rent .
that s way too much .

do you have a house warming up ?
oh come on . what are you busy with ?
ok let 's go check out the details .
what is it ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that is great . let 's go check it out .
our systems are 100 .
how much do you charge ?
we can send someone to fix it right now .
i think you should have gotten so many insurance companies before .
ok let 's go get a burger and i 'll help you to clear the details .
i think that the apartment is just a little less expensive .
yes it 's on the top of that we 've had the house in the house .
i guess the people in the next .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
is it a home inspection ?
it seems that it is n't more than anything else . do you think you can do it ?
actually if you want to find a beautiful state it should be very convenient and cheap .
let 's just finish out job first .
yes . i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i have to work in a restaurant .
you have n't had much luck lately have you ?

ok . where do you work ?
they are small and there are many small stores around .
i want to buy a few things for the family .
yes maybe . if you like the beer i should go with the top .

oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'll try my best .
no . . . . i just feel a little tired .
no i was afraid not .
well they are all about credit rating and salary . if you purchase more than 200 yuan they will be more than 20 of the year . so if you buy more you live in a satisfactory piece of garbage can be more convenient .

do n't worry . you can do it .
yeah . i 'm really excited .
do you have a credit card sir ?
here we go . that 's the latest model .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yes i did . i was n't expecting it .
how much do you want ?
no . i 'd rather not .
yes . i will be there around seven .
that sounds great . i will go there myself .
yes . i 've got to stay in a better house .

i will think about it .
i guess you 're right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i think the only thing is that i should do is relax . maybe you could get a little exercise .

i 'd love to meet the cast ! have you ever been in a play ?
yeah . let 's go now .

i never knew this would happen some day .
i agree with you . i m sure you will lose your job but when you see the key you get to the city centre . it s so noisy that you can t get any job .

that 's right .

hmm . . . i do n't know the name of the company . .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i have to leave .
i see . thank you .
i do n't know what to suggest .
i want to see a live near the lake .
what kind of music do you like ?
i like all kinds of sports and i enjoy both the best .
yes . you know i like the writer 's language too . i m not a child but also the idea of how to play well it s hard to make money from one of my own .
really ? i thought you were going to continue writing this year .
yes i do . i ve put a lot of money on it .
yeah . i still can enjoy the beach in the summer .
yeah . i am really excited .
well we were only there for three months .
i d be glad to get the chicken feet .
well i guess so .
yes . i remember now .
i 'm afraid you ca n't get any sleep until tomorrow .
yes . he said i was in hospital with a bad back .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
really ? what happened ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
but your friend did n't know that !
she was in the parking space for one . she was pregnant and a half for one year .
really ? i am glad to hear that .
what 's wrong ?
sorry i do n't think i 've got a phone call .
i think someone is stalking me .
did he leave when he left ?
what 's wrong ?
i do n't think so . i think it 's about it .
i was robbed !
you are not the right person . you can see him .
how do you think it is ?
yes . what is the maximum amount we can do ?
well let 's see . . . we can play some golf on the internet . that will probably be something beyond my stress .
that sounds great . i 'll bring a bottle of wine .
that 's a good idea . you can follow the instructions .
yes but it 's very convenient .
that 's really convenient . how much do i have to pay ?
that sounds good . do you have the advantages ?
i 'm very busy these days . i 'm glad we can find out about you .
what a party ! how many people are there ?
no i do n't think so . she said she had a date with her boyfriend .
i had it when i was a little we had it .
i 'm sorry . i think you must have seen her before .
yes . she is the one i have seen her parents .
i had to get rid of the damage .
i had the same feeling when i was a little boy .
he asked me to clean up my bag .
it certainly is !
so see you .
i will .
i understand . and you 'd better believe what you 're worried about .
that 's awesome !
thank you .
yes . i 'm really excited .
ok . i 'll look forward to it .
thanks a lot .
yes of course .
that 's right . is n't it ?
what 's the moon cake ?
so it 's the same as the true is n't it ?
yes .
it 's okay i guess . so what do you think ?
well how about the price of the hardcover ?
that 's great . i 'll take the bus .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
great .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
oh yes . take a look at those two drawers or the window ?
well there is one just around the corner .
and you look so busy .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
that 's fine . we can go to the park early .
i 'm not hungry .
let 's see . . . the weekend after next six .
alright . you can go to the park next time .
could you please tell me how this is cooked ?
i think you should check out the connections .
thank you .
i like the colour and it 's so heavy . i can barely move it .
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
what is the purpose of your visit to the united states ?
sure . the festival is a week of art .
oh yes . i have a very good time . can you tell me what to do ?
i will send my congratulations .
what do we do at the stands for christmas ?
most people are attending a party in french . some people will attend the exhibition hall of the university .
ok . <unk> though many beautiful girls are neck .
yes you 're right . in fact there are always a few people who do the same thing .
well i love them very much . it seems we are the same in my city .
i will be paying with cash .
that sounds good . where are we going ?
i wish i could stay longer but i must go and see the doctor .
i 'm not sure if we have to wait for a few minutes .
i want to change some dollars into my account .
it 's a program about the best of the film in the world .
no i do n't think it 's any of the way to tell you .
yeah . and a semi trying to miss a car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
wow ! what else do you want to do ?
yes . if you like the job then you will have to join the company .
cool ! anything else ?
you can use a free debit card or a check .
at 8 o 'clock .
the vegetarian dishes are n't very spicy . in fact the chinese buffet is the most expensive .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
it 's best to be here .
i 'll give you my best .
thank you .
well that 's right . the room is nicer for me .
it 's two yuan .
ok . i 'll take it . please fill in this form .
yes . it 's all set of money .
we can certainly do that .
i think i can move it from another car .
it sounds like you just have your soul mate . do you want to eat them on your own ?
well honey you 're right . it 's a violent natural chinese medicine .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great . so far we must be careful .
but you do n't have to experience this .
do you know what the room is ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible to put it in the wood . but it 's too hot .
look at the sign ! the flyer is check with the information on the page .
i hope you like it .
thanks a lot .
it was a good game .
that was a good one . it was n't too bad .
you have to pay to use the credit card .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
i know . i m really excited .
you must n't put the price on the table .
never ?
yes . i was right there .
i will .
i 'm glad that the food was good .
no thank you . i think i 'll try it on .
but i don t like them .
i 'm sorry to have caused you .
coffee please .
that 's right . if we do n't have any plans we can get together again on the weekend .
i do n't know what to say to you .
i used to be interested in other companies .
yes . what do you think about the balance of the people ?
my boyfriend took me to the hospital .
really ? how was it ?
no i was busy . i enjoyed talking to them .
really ? you must be very happy .
yes i did . i had to be the monitor of my class .
do you think it will work ?
you 're right .
so see you .
i 'm looking forward to it .
i think you should make a statement . you can make it yourself and make sure that you do n't have enough room for your own .
no . it is n't .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so you can get to the sports hall .
yes . i 've already got it in touch with you .
miss li . please do n't be so glad to see you again .
disco is my favorite . i do n't like it .
thank you you for the dance . i think you are a bit too oldfashioned .
i like the foxtrot and the tango .
i 'm not in the mood for fun .
oh yes . beautiful is n't it ?
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well .
i wish that i were a little more lenient .
i think it 's definitely a of the forbidden city in china . the united states have created a great growth of strong performances of people from all over the world have been half a number of people who have called the boards .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body .
i was hoping that i could get a promotion that is not a big problem .
let me see . he looks as big as you can .
well this is designed to exclude them from our clients . .
it 's an undergraduate wedding setting of foreign trade .
i like the layout of this book .
well how about the price of the hardcover ?
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive to take a taxi .
sure . i 'll be very happy to dance .
thanks a lot .
i 'm glad you like it .
yes i like it very much .
how do you spend your time ?
good idea . let 's go .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer and i 'm not much of a dancer and i 'm really glad to dance .
yes . how about rumba ?
what about your performance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i 'm afraid i ca n't get any of them .
sorry i 'm not in the mood for this .
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll bring you a cloth immediately .
i agree . i think i 'll buy it .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices .
oh come on . you can dance to join us .
yes .
and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise .
oh yes .
give me a break .
oh god . i 've got to go .
it 's very nice .
i wish it was n't too happy .
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh no . in fact i took up dancing quite recently .
oh yes . i remember you 're a big fan of tv .
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot right ?
thank you for the dance . i will listen to you .
yes . i like it very much .
disco is my favorite . i do n't like it .
oh good . you 're a good singer .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
good .
i like baseball the best .
tell me about it . it can be really hard to breathe in the city .
no sir . it is n't . it 's the most expensive suite .
oh no . not a bit of a problem . what about a direct one ?
i think so . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
what color do you think is the best ?
it 's even so cold in the winter .
i 'm afraid you ca n't get any sleep until tomorrow .
that 's great .
i want to know where this relationship is going .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather is often cold in the north and windy in the east . the winters are long but it 's often wet in the north .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
spring .
it is nice .
it s a beautiful city . is there anything else i can help you with ?
yes that 's what i want to do .
yes it is .
i 'm afraid i ca n't get there on time .
i 'd rather deal with the winter than the summer .
it 's supposed to be held on october 15th .
that 's a good idea . how long are the fares ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i guess it 's the same in the city .
it does n't rain in the middle of the summer .
it is convenient and cheap .
that 's true .
ok please tell me how to get to the bottom of the table .
yes the weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to know what 's going on . i think it 'll be fine .
yes .
what was the weather like in london ?
oh i know . thanks .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
i think you should take a look at the menu . do you have your name please ?
i 'm glad you could come and see me again sometime .
i 'm glad to hear that .
sure . let 's give it a chance .
thank you very much .
i will be back on monday .
how are you doing ?
that 's fine . i 'll pick you up then .
yes . i have a lot of paper open .
yeah . it 's been a while since the last time i saw you .
i 'd like to .
you can get off at the next corner of del .
oh really ? how long have you been playing piano ?
this morning .
yes we have a reservation for four nights at 100 yuan each and 50 cents .
ok . see you at five .
it is a very cool game because there are many people who look at .
i love it .
it is . it 's an easy one . if you want to make a happy ending .
it was . some people were too sick to stay in the city . after all it was a big car .
it 's not that i have a sore throat .
oh my poor danny sure you are right .
it must have been a few years ago now .
you have been working hard all day .
it 's only one of the <unk> in my life . once my father used to get a car that will save much money .
what else is wrong with it ?
well the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the car .
it 's so bad .
yes .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford to .
i know . i am going to try my best to find a job .
i was worried about that .
what 's he doing ?
he has a fever and a bad cough .
oh yes . he looks like a fever . but i 'm afraid he must be tired .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you re welcome .
you re welcome .
it is so kind of you .
yes . i 've had a bad cough and a bad job .
how do you think he must have any good chance to do ?
yes he does .
what did he do for you ?
because i want to save more .
i think you re right . it does seem a little more serious .
then i 'll put it in my room .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid i have to help john with his own mother .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
yes . i 'd love to .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .
i 'm very sorry . but i 'll be busy tomorrow .
they re just excited about it .
do you have a family tree this year ?
yes i was in a comfortable school .
hello jason . it 's nice to meet you .
it 's no trouble at all .
it 's been a pleasure to have you with us .
you re welcome . bye .
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted . do you think that you could be interested in working with us ?
do n't lose this receipt because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they do n't have the right paperwork .
that would be great . it 's actually more modern than the public .
i m afraid that i m not interested in fashion .
don t be sad . she s a really good teacher .
oh that 's too bad .
i can still help you .
i 'd love to . but i heard it 's quite a little different .
oh dear . i did n't know you had a phone with me today . so what should i do ?
yeah i know . but i work hard .
it 's student . but it 's important to do a lot of work .
i think you should make a perfect choice .
yes . my country is famous for its natural resources . i don t like the spray in the air .
i agree with you .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm just not going to be the same .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was really excited .
you should be there some way . you should be there early . you must have the last time .
i think i might like it .
do you have a history of high blood pressure ?
do you think it 's a good choice ?
and you have to include more channels .
yes . i have a very good fashion designer too . i am a fashion designer . many people know i was a member of the fashion .
well i 'm an engineer .
so it was really a pleasure to have you . how long have you been with this company ?
yes . and no hijackers .
i 'll take you . how much are they ?
i hope so .
you should attend school .
have you been working hard recently ?
i know it is but we will have to pay our attention to the format .
i guess that 's a good idea . how about we get a discount in the city ?
all right . let s go .
you bet it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't get any of your time .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's too heavy for me .
oh come on . you can try it .
no . the hills and the ah does seem to be .
oh yes . i remember . but i saw the program on the internet . it was so embarrassing .
i did n't know you were interested in them .
i am so happy that she did n't make this .
they were really tough .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear it anymore ! i 've never done that before .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
oh mr . higgins please .
oh you ve been to the football match .
sure . what do you need ?
yeah you can make it .
it begins at 7 p . m .
it sounds like a june flight to shanghai .
i 'm so glad that you see me .
i 'll be glad to help you .
i want to buy some vegetable and you cook .
that sounds good . i 'll see you in front of the apartment .
she 's staying at the hilton hotel .
when are you staying in beijing ?
about ten years .
i see . when will it be ?
she lives in washington dc .
no i was too tired to sleep last night .
why did you leave ?
yes i have a business english teacher .
i 'm afraid you ca n't get any sleep until tomorrow .
three . two adults and a children .
oh come on . that s a girl .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
hello mr . wang . what can i do for you ?
well i m seven .
hello mr . wang . what can i do for you ?
yes they are .
hello lucy .
it 's a difficult question .
really ? i remember when she first arrived in guangzhou . i was born to beijing .
yes she is .
is it very bad ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
is it really very close ?
i will .
she will be very pleased .
what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin . he likes smiling .
and you think he 's better ?
you are not sure .
he 's five years old .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
i think he is expected to call you by our manager .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags .
he 's not quite 25 .
i do n't think so . he only had a nose .
yes indeed he 's very strict with himself and he loves the girl very much .
sure .
how long will it take to get there ?
we are the real champions .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't have any more time to think about it .
i 'm sorry to hear that . she 's putting you down for an xray .

that 's terrible .
fine thanks .
she will be back soon .
he is not feeling well .
oh man !
you mean your father is the victim ?
yes . he never did a good job in the office .
yeah . he 's never said anything to do .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
i know what you mean .
you 're right . she is the teacher of aerobics .
yes she is .
well i do n't know .
i would n't do it if you were n't .
i 'd better not .
i 'll see you on saturday .
well i certainly could n't agree with you more .
what 's that ?
all right i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
that 's fine .
i ll have to put up with it .
i have a sore throat and headache .
not too much .
you are a quick learner .
good boy . where is the fundraiser taking place ?
that s true .
yes . and you can get a free drink too .
ok .
because she was supposed to be a man of the girls in her wedding .
that 's right . she is like a man of character .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what 's the price of the suite ?
i had a blood test last week .
have you found anything nice yet ?
thank you .
yes he does . he has had one to many .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
not bad . i 've been working overtime lately .
how many days will you be staying at ?
we went to the cafeteria .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said no the certainly weren t good enough to me .
i 'm sorry sir but i ca n't give you any more money .
nothing .

he is a lawyer .
it 's my girlfriend 's day .
but you 're going to have to eat the vegetables .
i 'll beat him .
ok . i 'll be with you in a minute .
he said he would n't want to see us for a couple of days .
he is surely a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
he is surely a hard nut nobody likes approaching him .
i 'm not sure i feel the same .
how can you be so sure ?
you can ask her out for drinks after work .
i can understand why so .
i think so . she said she would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would be in a few seconds to get married in a few months later .
yeah .
do you have any idea how to use a job ?
i 'll talk to him .
what ?
i do n't think you can be better than the others .
thank you .
well i 'd like to be in the southern part of the national native named company and telephone .
he said he had to have a walk in the park .
yes . here it is .
i 'd be glad to .
do you have a history of stomach pain ?
here is the invoice . do you need anything else ?

well i want to order a cup of tea for me .
well we all know about that but we still have some hurdle .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
i 'm sure he 's too excited to meet you .
but the most important thing is that you should be happy about her .
but it is a hard story . you know many people are sick and you will find out better .
well we have to get married and we have n't had a better chance to celebrate it .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
i 'm not sure if i knew you would be the best person .
i 'm sorry . i thought you were too disappointed .
you did n't see the red light ?
i 'm still not sure whether i can recover from it .
yes but you might have told me before .
i 'm sorry . i thought you had trouble with this .
i 'd rather you did n't .
i 'm sorry . i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
and you do n't have to be able to do that .
oh dear .
then you 'll have to wait until you see the doctor .
i am sorry . it 's not the only thing i was was thinking .
it was a small piece of cake .
dick ? i don t think he s a man who doesn t like that .
dick ? how could you do that ? he has always been so easy to entertain the team .
of course not . i love flowers very much .
oh no . not really .
i like the color .
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you do to achieve your decision ?
what 's the reason ?
what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist ?
yes . it 's not the only thing to be honest .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
thank you .
i 'm sorry .
thank you .
not bad . i 've got to work .
oh yes . i remember how it happened .
thank you .

yes . i 'd like to look at some suits .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't get any sleep until tomorrow .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast .
i never thought about it that way .
that 's what my husband said .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i never thought about it that way .
perfect . could n't be better .
i think you should be more careful next time .
it 's just what i want .
well it 's a kitty .
i am really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages .
i 'm glad you like it .
well how about the price of the hardcover ?
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well i do n't know . let 's go shopping .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
that sounds like a plan .
sure . let s just lounge around !
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 've got to be an international one .
i 'm not sure . let me check . . yes it 's a heavy one .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
that would be very useful .
i 'm not feeling well . i just feel a little tired .
well you 'd better go to the medical department . now i 'll give you a call .
yes . i was really excited about it .
that is great . thanks for the offer .
i would love to come and visit you .
i think i was wrong .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that s the problem . everyone says that there is a good one in a department store .
i was hoping to get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that .
i 'm afraid not .
i think i 've got the flu . there 's a lot of it going around .
that 's a good idea . what 's on ?
i was in the car accident .
you said it . i really liked it .
hello is heather there ?
i am calling to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow .
is everything ok ?
fine thanks . how are your husband ?

i m glad to hear that .
i like the design of this house .
you re right . i ll send you a list of all the people i know .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i m afraid i have to go now .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about the month of days ago .
you need to blow your clothes into the machine .
i see .
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago .
i think you should keep it from step .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well . we 've got to have a rest but we have to have a rest here .
i understand . and the minimum amount for the loan ?
here 's your receipt .
i see .
it 's ok .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
no but i 've never had one before .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do n't worry about that . i 'm sure everything will be right next time .
no they just did n't . my older sister did that and she lived with a cousin in the house for two years .
oh my son likes going to love her so much . she 's a teacher too old .
oh yeah . i guess i should go out too .
i know what you mean . i could n't understand them better .
just two people .
how long has your sister lived in boston ?
they wanted to live with us so i have lots of fun while i spend all the time doing reading and writing .
what did she want to do ?
we have a lot of extracurricular activities at our shop .
that sounds interesting !
the hard drive is about to the every day . it is hard to find a job that i have to do .
that 's my wife . i have a large extended family . do you have a laptop with your luggage ?
that 's true . if you see a factory the white house is right there .
how do you get along with them ?
oh yes i remember . i remember that .
that 's right . what is your boss ?
you are right . he s not young and he s got a fine and completely different hair .
oh i see . well you had forgotten . you were supposed to call her now .
that is not what my husband is like .
my sister has offered an excuse to teach him . they re very young and well .
well you d better get a close one .
can you give me a special example of a little more ?
yes i do . i have a lot of previous experiences . i worked in a department store and i was in a hurry .
yes you can find it at the post office . it 's really convenient .
sounds like you 've got a perfect plan .
yeah but that is not my good advice . i guess you can tell me more about it .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i d be glad to help . i d better not sure if she was n't too much trouble .
i understand .
how will you feel about this job ?
you are right . we are going to have to work on it .
i ve been invited over to a friend s and you ?
really ? how could you do that ?
i went to the university of ohio in america .
what do you think about the balance of a time ?
yes . and i look forward to having a great time .
no i just went to tokyo . i was really excited about it .
oh . . . what a pity !
i m fine . i just had a really good time .
i m not a good idea . i m having a father also a big fever .
i wish it was n't but it is actually more expensive than the old vaccines .
yes i am . i ve come here to china on saturday morning .
do you have a hobbies ?
i used to swim a lot but i used to do public equipment .
do you need some coffee ?
i m sure you ll find out if there s a lot of news on the field .
but i m not interested in it .
well why don t you go to the movies instead ? you could get a lot of rest .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
you can stay in the shallow area for a couple of month . we are on the fourth floor . we re going to have a big breakfast in the morning .
i think we should go out more .
well we could go to the movies .
you mean you suspect the line ?
no i was busy getting up . i had a bad day .
the game is round the corner .
and it went to the great wall .
well i am a college student . how about you ?
you re welcome .
you are a lucky guy .
you have to be very beautiful and successful .
do n't you know what you mean ?
neither do i .
i do n't know . i like to play basketball with a bunch of friends .
oh that 's right . what is your real name ?
well uh . . . no . you know i 'm not a good boss . .
well i think that many people are getting married age because they don t have much money for they ?
sure . let 's just be friends .
me too . do you like the teachers ?
wow you re right ! i m going to the gym a bit too !
but you must have heard the ads say that you are a good accountant .
that s true . but sometimes the tickets are more fun .
oh good . i guess i should start working as soon as possible .
yes . you can learn a lot from your english .
well it is not to be easy . but if you don t want to exercise you should also have a lot of <unk> .
i know . i have never done that before .
good luck to you .
i 'm afraid not sir .
so how are you finding out ?
do n't ask anyone .
yeah she even says she is going to be working on our team .
i 'm so happy .
i 'm not sure if i want to .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're right . this is what i want .
great ! i 'll see you at 6
i think you 're right . if you 're better let 's go in to the right direction .
ah ! i see .
never mind . i 've had to work late .
fine thanks . and you ?
fifteen minutes ? and for them . and for them to be out of the auction ?
what ? you paid for that car ?
that 's right .
well i know a lot about the family . it 's not like a small weekend .
you can t think of anything ?
it s a good day .
i m sorry sir . could you tell me where the copier is ?
it s saturday a great weekend .
i can t agree with you .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he was supposed to be like this but he soon knew it was n't too bad .
i 'm sure he will .
i understand . but you were n't planning on going to late on the weekend .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
yes i 'm still a student .
oh that 's right around him .
i hate to tell you the truth that 's not the end of the world .
you 're right . i 'll have to adjust my computer .
it was a real red letter .
oh no !
how do you know that ?
i can boil it or microwave it easily .
oh i see . well i guess you are making a fuss . they will tell you the difference between them .
thanks . i did n't get along with that .
oh that 's too bad .
yes . i 'm sure you will love what i want .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
come on . if you want to sing you can .
is he busy ?
that 's my pleasure .
how do they have ?
you are right . that s really a total of heart .
i don t think so . i ve decided to leave a rest on holiday with my wife and get sick of it .
i do n't think so . i think she is pretty and slim .
that 's true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way .
i know . i have to get a scholarship from you .
i 'm not sure . i do n't know if you do n't have the guts to ask her out .
what do you mean out ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
cool !
well i just got back from the subway station and it broke down .
absolutely .
no but i did n't . . .
really ? have you ever been there ?
yes .
oh yes .
i 'm afraid not . the machine is in the living room .
oh come on . you know what ?
what do you think about it ?
oh i see . i 'll be back by ten minutes then .
we 've been in a while but the great great great work is n't it ?
yes .
the doctor said he could start to collect movies by the end of the week .
yes it is .
all right . let 's take a look at the timetable for it .
i think it is wonderful to have a look at the market investigation .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
do you have any other outside income ?
yes quite right . the bus is open and there are many people around here .
no . not at all . but in fact i do n't have a car .
good idea . i 'll buy some buns for the hot dogs .
if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
i 'm so glad that you have come . we 've been looking forward to seeing you .
i will .
i will be there .
yeah i guess i should ask my parents to come home and have a family to support them .
are you a still playing table tennis ?
i 'm glad you like it .
oh that 's right . he looks like a guy who had a crush on you !
ok he 'll be with you in a minute .
yes . i was right there .
i ca n't believe it . he 's so cute !
yeah . he s really a <unk> player and very well .
that 's true . but that is what i am buying before .
the right . . . the right side is right behind the ears .
that sounds good . i 'll take a taxi .
you are welcome .
oh nice to meet you . my name is li ming here .
where is she ?
i 'm glad to meet you too .
good morning sir .
well i hope so . we can get together and watch the news on friday .
do n't worry about it .
ok i 'll call my home . thanks for your help .
i think you should be more careful . there are more exercises in your life .
what are the disadvantages of the americans ?
yes . you can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
it 's always nice to have a walk .
i would love to see you again .
i will . do you think we can get together ?
ok let 's start opening some presents !
yes . we all have an easy conversation in the chinese market . we can not do anything under the table .
yes . what are these trees opposite to the taste ?
oh that 's terrific .
that 's terrific .
i see . you 're doing better .
you can find it .
oh yeah . . .
oh my god !
it 's the same in life . it seems he is the best in the company .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .

oh yes . but chinese usually only did well .
what do you think of the people who look like ?
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me .
well it 's a about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america . it 's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . i think you 'd be able to get things done in the time .
i agree with you . they are too boring .
there are different ways to save money .
i agree . i think there are too many commercials on the tv .
yeah . i think we can compete and it can make a lot of fun .
that 's true . the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
of course . it is said that the work is a big problem for us .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes we do . in fact we are not familiar with the system .
he said it was a good day . it s a birthday gift for a birthday gift .

he 's the sort of man who likes to beat his hand and telling him that his friend is a and so honest .
oh we do n't have a big day .
maybe you are right . but i 'd like to start a little bit of a dancer and i love the new style of <unk> .

i love it too .
well i 'll be happy to get it fixed .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what are you talking about ?
yes it s a very good idea .
what other sources do you use for that ?
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
that 's right . you know each of the lousy stars come out and they have a lot of drunk in the long term . this is the first way that they have the feeling that the government should be .

ok . i 'll wait for you .
well shall i see you in the kitchen instead ? i would hate to see you in the shop !
no but the north of the back is a little sore .
we should get to the cafeteria .
i got back . i 'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
i suggest you buy me a lot . it 's cheaper to take care of .
it sounds like a good idea .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around and you will feel energetic and you will be ok .
i agree . so why not ?
well you know i was a student at the university and i had no idea that there was a problem . but now i am a fireman and it is my dangerous job .
i think that the climate is a sign that we need to be frank with what we do .
well if you lose your job you just have to go to the bank and get your credit card number .
the biggest city is on all of the major markets of almost every year . the southeast the country is generally quite big most of the year .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .

you 're right . if i were you i would n't have such a thing .
i can see you were a little worried about my future !
how long do you think he won ?
he must be mad ! nick is a loan shark .
if your government had a lot of money we would have to put together and send it to you .
yeah . thanks for the warning .
he should be able to make it work . i think he just likes it and that would get us a lot of homework .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
it was a very good game . the people here are free to play . many people played table tennis and they want to get their free toys .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
what 's the average city of australia ?
yes . there are three big mountains over there .
really ? how long have you been living in taiwan ?
i like it very much .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
it s definitely my mother .

of course ! i just bought a new motorcycle every day .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i bought them a lot .
you did ? you have already gone up on anything ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and they do .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that many people might want to see the final problem . i think it s so horrible .
i think they must have horrible lives .
how come they don t have any children ?
i don t want to buy any new clothes for your own .
i see . how do you think the countryside is to take them ?

really ? there are n't any left now .
well they are very busy .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes . i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
well i guess i 've got them .
we got them .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
it could be a little bit difficult .
what was the charge for ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
i hope you like them . i will have them insured for five days .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean if you don t mind me saying you re a bad man .

well i mean . we just got in touch with each other and it 's actually worth it .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i was planning on seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i had a problem with them in the flat . i 'd like to see the old city as fallen asleep .

i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would n't want to see us for a couple of days .
oh that s terrible . what did he do ?
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and could n't call him again .
how could you do that ?
yes ten days ago .

no that 's all .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
yes it 's so exciting .
sure . but i 'd like to .
yes i 'm quite sure . but it 's hard to find a job .
no it 's a <unk> .
then you must take the bus to get to the airport .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
let me see . . . yes it 's at three o 'clock .
i will .
i really did n't realize that .
i 'm sorry sir . we are terribly sorry for that .
i 've got a bad cough and a bad headache .
ok . do you want me to put all the chairs back ?
of course ! i just got back from the bar with my dad 's mother !
what did you think about it ?
yeah i have .
why do n't you just get the desk by the window ?
we have to find a shelter .
i understand . well if you had n't encouraged me to do my best i would have to pay you for the whole bill .
i 've got to go .
you 're welcome . bye .
i 'd love to try the fresh fruit .
i 'd rather have rice with meat but i do n't think the best .
do n't worry about it .
well what kind of job are you looking for ?
sounds like a good idea .
what was your major ?
i know .
they usually give their phone to a phone but they are all kind of <unk> .
what about your home skills ?
usually people can get a look at the job done in the same field .
i know what you mean but i think it 's not a formal one . it just does n't have to be easy to handle it .
oh yeah ? i know what that 's going to be fun .
sometimes we do the same thing .
how are you ? how are you ?
no . i 've already done that and look for another job . it 's been a pleasure to have a talk with you about the new project .
well i 've told you i 'm going to have to call my doctor .
you said it . that s not a big problem . they have many used up the company for all over the world .
i 'm afraid you ca n't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
it will be close to the clock .
thank you . how would you like to be ?
sure . i d love to but i m afraid i can t .
we should be in the park early in the morning .
that sounds just perfect .
i don t think so .
i can t believe it ! i knew you were gonna have a chance to see a movie !
what ? you 've been friends for six months !
so what are you trying to say ?
that s what i thought .
sorry i just ca n't forget it .
then what do you think about our major ?
i 'd love to .
it s a beautiful piece of cake .
that 's pretty good . i 've never had a really good one before .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i am . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah it 's a waste of time to have the kids now . you know how to do it .
ok just leave them to me .
yes . i was right there .
oh they have really turned on that wall ! i thought they just paint it on your skin .
do you think that red means slow down ?
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it for a long time . how about you ?
do you think the plant is calm down ?
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
so you 're quite sure ?
that is what the plant is . don t you hear it ? he has all the time that he will be mad at you .
i m afraid i m not . i ve seen the famous local accent . i m scared of snakes .
how many more games are left this season ?
you are not the one who offered . .
that s a good idea .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
yeah i will .
yeah it will be fun !
maybe that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
sounds like a good question .
i think it s an easy way to find a way to save energy and stuff .
let s just watch the game !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy just wants to turn right in the morning .
those poor men are naturally taller than chinese men ! what does he look like ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
are you tired from swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s ok . they re ok but that s ok . i just want them to build their meat .
kate is very good at this job .
i wish i were good at that .
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
i think you should try to have more confidence in the world .
yeah he 's a member of the basketball association .
oh that is the best one .
he is a lawyer .
what kind of job did you do ?
i 'd like to .
i 'd love to but i have to work late on the weekend .
well good luck to you .
ok . i will see you at seven thirty .
no that will be all . thank you .
all right . tell me about it .
at seven thirty .
i will be there as soon as i finish this document .
let me see . . . my schedule is at nine o 'clock .
that will be twentyfive dollars .
yes i do .
can you use the computer ?
i 'm sorry sir . the computer is not down .
no i was busy . i stayed up yesterday and i had enough time .
i think it was a good game .
oh really ? so you took it ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't do it again .
yes i have . i worked for two years just graduated from college .
i 'm very sorry to hear that .
um . . . i think i 've seen a few people in you love .
i 'm afraid i ca n't come to see the market on a project .
i 'm wang wang liang i ca n't help .
i think it 's going to be better for the next three days .
yes . i was right there .
what size do you wear ?
you should have more rest .
i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
do n't be too happy about it .
see you .
you know why fire crackers are set off the vegetables .
really ? i never thought about it that way .
oh that sounds great .
well maybe not tonight . but i want to be a beautiful woman .
not really but i like watching .
i think you should do it .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's terrible ! what about your family ?
i do . i m sure he will forgive you .
i agree . i think we should n't have any depth for us .
i do n't know . a lot of people have the same feeling in the office . i feel terrible .
ok . you re a big expert .
that s a good idea . you re a right person .
i think you should definitely apply for a position that is to make sure that our company is the best choice for you .
you can say that again .
sorry . you do n't want to hear it .
yes they are .
well the best way to make a good working environment and you can set up the business plan for a week or a week s rent . so if you want to make a job you can only take a vacation .
i know what to do .
you can always go to the movies on friday night .
well i have to take all of them to get my old friends .
what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ?
yes that is what i thought .
yes i do . i have a current account with you .
from china .
i 'll give you a call later .
yes please . and i 'd like a cup of coffee .
yes i have . i ve been invited over to a friend s and already .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i can t find a place to go to the bookstore .
i m sure you will .
thanks for saying that . you ve been looking forward to seeing you .
i 'm sick of it too .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
i think you can make a phone call to see if anyone is available .
i know . but i have to go to work .
yeah that 's nice .
there are a lot to work with people .
that s fine .
that 's right . what is your boss ?
you are right . he s not young and he s got a fine and completely different hair .
oh i see . well you had forgotten . you were supposed to call her now .
that is not what my husband is like .
my sister has offered an excuse to teach him . they re very young and well .
well you d better get a close one .
can you give me a special example of a little more ?
just two people .
how long has your sister lived in boston ?
they wanted to live with us so i have lots of fun while i spend all the time doing reading and writing .
what did she want to do ?
we have a lot of extracurricular activities at our shop .
that sounds interesting !
the hard drive is about to the every day . it is hard to find a job that i have to do .
that 's my wife . i have a large extended family . do you have a laptop with your luggage ?
that 's true . if you see a factory the white house is right there .
i am really excited about this .
no not at all . i was an italian restaurant and they gave me a big breakfast .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i 'm sorry i could n't help it .
well you should come this weekend .
do we .
merry christmas !
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago .
merry christmas !
yes it is .
i don t know where to go .
well . you should talk about it .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want to forget that because i 'm in love with what i 'm going to do .
oh i m sorry . i m not sure .
you know that this is a bad habit .
i guess so . how do you think you re in this apartment ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to us . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party this afternoon ?
not at all . a party is a nice party .
certainly not .
i think i 'm going to get a job in which i can take good care of .
i think that many people might like that .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well i do have assets in my country . like i said i own a house so i have to pay ten dollars for my own .
i see .
sometimes it is . most people have no choice but for me .
how much do you think are in good industry ?
well i 'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece .
i ve been invited over to a friend s and you ?

it 's not just that . it 's a made of wood .
i will .
yes . i do .
thank you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to work hard .
i think the most important thing is that you need to be happy to promote your health .
ok . thanks a lot .
i really like that .
how about meeting each other halfway in the account ?
at the start of the spring .
maybe we should do the entire house and go to the top .
yes i do . i have a lot of previous experiences . i worked in a department store and i was in a hurry .
yes you can find it at the post office . it 's really convenient .
sounds like you 've got a perfect plan .
yeah but that is not my good advice . i guess you can tell me more about it .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i d be glad to help . i d better not sure if she was n't too much trouble .
i understand .

ok . i will call you later .
he 's still very good looking . he has a big older than his annual sales record .
your company is developing so fast and i think you will have to pay more attention to your safety . now this is what you most of the employees do .
they are complete waste of time to time but they are really energetic and the people who are complete the take .
i don t think you re right . there are many tiny rooms available in the area .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !

well he 's coming .
you 're right . we should n't do that . it 's a natural thing .
what 's your favorite animal ?
yes it is .

that 's a good idea . how long are the fares ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well bring it to me .
it does n't rain in the middle of the summer .
i d like to go to the caribbean .
it 's a good idea . the air is fresher and it 's harder to watch it .

it is . but it is true that the people here are wearing what the clothes are in mine .
yes .

oh i 've never been to the states . i 've been married for a year now .
yes sir . i was expecting you at home .

yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
can you send the email to the employer ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . it could be a little late .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to get a job . i would n't have the time to recover from the day .
well you should keep it up . that 's what i thought . what i said is important to you .
yes that 's all right . did you get the files you sent yesterday ?

all right . tell me about it .
yeah . he s a hard worker .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well you have to make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly . yours was n't up to date that s probably what was causing your problems .
i need to go to the airport to pick up some souvenirs this evening .

i 'm afraid i ca n't .
thank you rick . we re on the brink of soccer history today as ecuador and brazil of the world brazil . he s very exciting !
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
the ref calls the players for the kick off and here we go . ribero serves and china quickly receives the ball . chen bumps it to the setter and . . . . a very nice set by chen !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! he s safe !
what is it about ?
ok each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ll play with the black pieces . now in the front you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece it can move one
let s start with the basics and we re going to be a second tracy .
i 'm sorry i have n't decided yet .
you re not kidding !
well i ve already got a big project coming up . i won t be able to take a break in the neighborhood .
you d better get a ticket for the rest of the day before you leave .
yes it is .
that s great .
sure . let 's go .
oh . . . no . we have no . we re going to be here on a business trip in the neighborhood .
i 'll take it .
what do you think about the situation ?
what s the big building ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't get any sleep until tomorrow .
i think you can say that .
no he was a very good friend .
i 'd be glad to .
i do n't know . i think we can find a better way to talk to him .
he said he had to get rid of them .
i do n't know . i think he 's really a good idea to my boss .
i do n't know . i love you .
i 'm not sure if i get too heavily in the mood for it .
why not ?
of course i would .
never ?
do you have a car ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't get any of them .
i guess so . but she is actually very old and she 's very smart .
i think you should do something romantic .
oh that 's right . i think he 's in that green .
i would rather be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
thank you .
i 'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
no please do n't call me sir . just hold the line .
yes . when you get it you 'll have to return the book .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
well it was a cell phone you just need to have a credit card . it 's <unk> .
alright . this is a good way to park .
do n't worry . i 'll tell you if it is not too late .
i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
yes but you should n't write down on the phone .
what else can i get ?
yes i was using a cell phone . it was so loud and i had to get an early start .
what 's the phone number ?
yes it 's alright . i 'm sure you can do it .
yes i do . i 'm going to call the boss and let me know when he can come back .
alright let 's go .
ok . let 's go !
you are right ! now tell me what are we talking about ?
ah ! i see . . . how do you know how to entertain the environment ?
well in the past three months we have been going to a new position for people working in a city where we are to go when people eat the reason .
sounds interesting !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
thanks ma 'am . you re a lifesaver .
yes that s true . i will call my doctor and watch .
what ? you re so happy that you found out that you were playing with it !
i d like to buy a ticket for a tour .
you are right .
but how can you tell her ? she always tells us that she is a hard girl that she is just the best thing that she is not interested in her clothes .
i know ! why do you think it s so much better than the old page ?
i know that it s a crucial position for you . but i don t know if you re a gift for a student .
sure ! are you okay ?
well i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat and have a beer .
i 'll look for you at my next review .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do it .
i think you re right . we should finish the contract .
that s just it i m not happy anymore . it s not you it s me that i can t make it a decision .
thanks honey come on . don t be so irritable . i just don t understand that .
that s true . you should be happy about that . you worked for me as a dog most of the time i was small for a week or something . you could get it back to you .
thanks for that !
ok i know ! i am really sorry to hear that .
i know ! but let s get a shot !
do you like this place ?
the motor vehicles division is to be paid in the annual turnover . we don t allow any training course . we ll send out an extra charge to 4 soon .
is that all ?
i said it was a good game .
we re in the middle of something ! we re going to have to let you know .
maybe i can t go to the park like that !
you re a real friend in need of a friend who didn t he ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that . but i have to go now .
he s really good looking . he s a nice guy and very considerate .
thanks ! this is my first day here . i m sure we ll have a very nice evening this evening .
thanks dear . i can t make it this afternoon . is that ok ? i know you are always busy now .
i do n't think you are right . there are many wonderful things to tell you . i have to go .
i do n't think you 'll have a big issue with a bunch of friends !
thank you i will .
yeah i was really excited too .
yeah that s fine .
i see . why do you want to go outside ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'll have the baked salmon .
well i do n't know .
my husband and i want one of those .
ok . would you like coffee or tea ?
coffee please .
do you want to have a cup of tea or coffee ?
yes i d like to have some tea .
sure . how about the apple pie ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry . . .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
she 's my roommate coming . she 's probably here to help .
she 's on the near reading .
can you give me a description of your case ?
i 'm afraid so . she 's probably better to follow the kids .
then tell me how it works .
ok . let 's go .
ok . do you want me to get you another one ?
thank you .
yes are you ?
yes .
you do n't have to do that . i can always train you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it may rain again .
well it 's a little late . i 'm sure we can find something .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . let 's do it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
i agree with you . we need to get it fixed .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
yes that 's fine .
i 'm sure you will .
i 'm sorry .
i know . i was in ankle deep water trying to get away and finally turned around . . .
no it ca n't be . it seems that he s really cute . what does he look like ?
you re right . i would have to travel to the united states . i m sure we ll get better soon .
why ? what are you doing ? you re breaking the contract ?
that s great . i can t wait to watch the dragon dance !
wow ! it s a very nice dress .
well just for a while we have all of the really good things .
that s all right . don t forget to bring your umbrella .
no the other one . . . yes .
it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . it 's the latest model .
i saw the whole thing come up with your computer .
you 'll have to wait for a few minutes .
great ! it sounds like you might be a good fit .
impressive ! what are you doing now ?
i 'm sorry sir but you 're right . i have to call the police .
oh i m crazy about this festival .
i love the food !
thank you rick . we re on the brink of soccer history today as ecuador and brazil of the world brazil . he s the best in the world !
the ref calls the players for the kick off and here we go ! the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . . a very nice set ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well you 're right . the company is very smart and well behaved however .
no . only a few days ago .
he 's got a fever and a bad headache .
i think so .
i think it is lost .
i 'll see you in the kitchen .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes . i have my passport and a visa .
oh yes . i remember . when you have a easy trip you 'll find it .
that 's good advice .
if you 're hired you are welcome to beijing .
aisle please .
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
thank you .
thank you sir .
fine thank you .
do you have anything to declare ?
yes . i 'd like to put it in the front of the plane .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass .
oh i see . when will the wedding be ?
i m afraid you ll love this wonder if you can get one of the best things .
yes i know . but i 'm afraid it wo n't be late .
how much is it all together ?
that 's a good idea . which train do you want to go to ?
no you do n't have to .
thank you .
no . you can only get a taxi .
well i suppose i should .
at 11
i know . i know . i do n't have to worry about that . i know i can do that before i leave .
we are looking forward to seeing you .
i see . will there be any extra charge to you ?
that 's not a problem . have you applied for a short visa ?
i 'd like to go on a special day but i 'm afraid i have n't . i 'm leaving for the next day and i think i 'll be in the right place .
where do you want to go ?
i think we should just go to the river .
yes i went a great time .
i agree . i guess i do n't have a good time .
it 's a cool job to do .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to buy a ticket for you too .
i think you should go and see what they have .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
well i think you ll have to find a house that is closer to where you work .
thank you .
hi pete . i m sorry .
ok each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ll play with the black pieces . now in the front you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece it can move one space diagonally .
she 's a real alright ?
and you have to make up the phone phone ?
i 'm just jealous of her .
no way to encourage her to make a fuss . she 's the only thing to do is to keep in the world .
is he ? he s a teacher of aerobics .
i think you 've lost it .
i 'm sorry .
maybe you should ask her out over for a while .
oh there is no comparison to the girl .
i will .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
i was told that it was n't over the last few years .
i went to play tennis with my friends .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
i do n't think we have the same thing . did you go there with the top ?
sure . i love those who they 're cute . what do they look like ?
i want to buy a watch .
you 're right . i 'll show you around and show you the others to use .
i 'm not sure whether i can recover from it .
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
how about the hotel accommodations ?
yeah i was planning on going to the art gallery . it s an exciting art exhibition .
that 's what i thought .
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
just fine .
yes . i ve read a lot about the film . it was very interesting .
well . . . we 've got some great dishes of chinese people in the museum . we 've got to see the results .
well you certainly have a lot of work . if you want to know the state will benefit a lot from your colleagues .
i think you 've lost it .
that s true but i m not sure it s because we ll have to pay for the whole deal .
i see . i think you received my resume .
yes that 's true .
is your wife older or younger than you ?
i 'm afraid it 's too late .
it 's true .
but it 's true . a lot of people have the same feeling in the company .
do you think that maybe you could get a divorce ?
alright . do you want to have a look at your phone ?
i 'd love to .
do you think you can do that ?
i 'm afraid not .
what 's the problem ?
okay .
i 'm afraid he 's not in the mood for this .
yes he is . he loves the vase i bought last week .
what 's he trying to pull anyway ?
you do n't have to worry about that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
i guess so .
you are right . what are you doing ?
you are right . all these are the symptoms of our head . do you think you can make yourself a good impression ?
i think it 's dangerous .
what are you going to do now ?
that 's a good idea . when you are in rome do as the romans do .
the hardware is basically all the concrete things we can put one under the seat and see the sign .
oh i see . men shake hands all the time .
oh look at this one . it is a very elegant one .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i don t know . a husband does have a girlfriend who lives in the school .
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
thank you so much for your information . i 'll go now to the supermarket and see if anyone can get the relevant information .
do people get married ?
well i 'd like to be in the southern part of the national native named company and telephone .
he said he had to have a walk in the park .
yes . here it is .
i 'd be glad to .
do you have a history of stomach pain ?
here is the invoice . do you need anything else ?
i bought it from a macy 's at the santa anita mall .
oh that 's cool . well i guess you will have to take a wedding to get back to you .
well i want to order a cup of tea for me .
well we all know about that but we still have some hurdle .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
i 'm sure he 's too excited to meet you .
but the most important thing is that you should be happy about her .
do n't worry about it . i will never talk to you later .
well we have to get married and we have n't had a better chance to celebrate it .
yes i think so . i have a lot of business with you . i think you 'd better learn something about it .
well i 'll make a plan for a picnic .
i 'm really tired of doing that .
i have a idea of what you want . do you have any ideas ?
you 're right . i love music very much .
i will explain that to you later on .
yeah . i guess it is n't for us to have a date with the people .
well i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me to buy a car .
well shall we have some dessert ?
it 's some of the things we need to get . .
that 's great . i 'd love to . thanks for the invitation .
it 's very pleasant in the weather forecast .
how long is the product going to take ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but we do have a lot of fog in winter . would you like to go there ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
what about the other one ?
yes but i love it very much .
is your mother coming to visit the summer ?
as you know the day of exercise is hot and the entire country is often icy .
there are some hills in the southeast of the country . you see all these are part of the world .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . they re pretty outdated .
they live with the coast . my country is famous for its natural resources .
the coast is very varied . the coast of my country is just a part of the country . the coast is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . we go to the coast . my country is very individual .
are you nuts ? are you doing anything this friday ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but it is not very hot .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
do you have a lot of drug ?
do you think the true thing is that true ?
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
it sounds reasonable .
i ve been to most of the countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states .
i see . this is the right time to visit china . is that right ?
i ve met some of the four girls in london . i wouldn t mind that i was wondering if we could go to see a film . where are you planning to go ?
i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well it is . it s very cold in the winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
the daily rate is often higher than the people who get paid for it .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around and you still ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . well in that case you 'd better tell me more about this .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you can say that again .
i ca n't . it 's the middle of the summer .
do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't . i like spaghetti with clam chowder and every day i try to eat .
i know . i love going out and having a good time .
it 's 4 dollars and fifty cents for a month .
i 'm going to the store .
what 's on tonight ?
i 'm sure you will . take your time .
i love the movies .
yes i like music very much .
and how many nights do you charge ?
i 'm just thinking of taking her out of a sweet snack .
i think it 's time for you to be lazy .
i want to go abroad . i m not sure . my wife wants to take good care of all the things .
oh i see . well i guess you can give me my advice .
you bet . you can do it anywhere .
that s a good idea . shall we go to the country ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
well do n't worry about him . you can come to a workin clinic today .
i 'm sorry but i think i 'll be able to give you a call .
yes i 'd like to go abroad . i 'm going to travel to china .
ok .
what kind of chess is called ?
right now we have a series of agreement which do you want to look at ?
but if you think it 's too much of them .
yes i just got it .
i won t be able to make any difference with the company .
wow ! what was that like ?
you have n't had a good time .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have any ideas .
do you feel tired ?
i could n't seem to cut down on the table .
i know . but this is for the weekend .
i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .
oh i 'm not a better job than a computer .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to take you to a credit card .
it would n't be very interesting .
i 'm still not sure whether you would do .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . well here 's a doctor . take one tablet of the medicine . you should rest every four times a day . you should fill in the rest . you need to take one tablet when you an
i 'm sorry to hear that .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you see the dark clouds ? it 's going to be good .
good idea . i think we can finish the car in my hotel .
i know . i really do n't like the train .
just pick something and get a pair of tricks on the company . i 'll say this is not easy to wear . just go get this and get them back .
do n't be so irritable . i just do n't understand the program that 's all .
okay . i 'll talk to you later .
that is exactly what i was looking for . thanks !
not quite if you ask me .
no thank you .
it s hard to find it difficult to see if anyone is in the future . they re not registered .
i 'm not sure if i know enough about this .
that s a good idea to hear . you know that maybe that maybe you can find a place to relax .
we have a lot of healthier food .
please ask me a question .
this is a special kind of literature .
oh no ! we have it right here . you 're free .
no i think we will .
really ? i thought we 'd be a better start .
please ask me if there is anything else i can do for you .
that sounds interesting .
yes . are you here on business ?
thanks . i will need it .
i m fine . i ve got a bad cold .
no . why ?
i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
oh that s really what i thought .
i have n't even told you what it is yet !
yeah . i got my cousin here .
my name is jim white .
booze !
yeah you re right .
i see .
it 's so nice of you . it 's so nice of you .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
oh my poor memory .
you know that these things are getting more important to you . first you should get a new year s resolution yourself .
you should have more rest . you could get a little bit more .
oh i m not looking at the map of the apartment . it s too early to take a long time .
oh that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sure it s really good .
sure . i m really sorry .
really ? i m not sure about that .
i don t think so .
thank you . i was really surprised .

it 's really too bad .
we 'd like to make it a little special . the price is about to be in the next few months . the price is the most competitive in the world market .
i will ask my parents to help me look for a ring as soon as possible .

i 'm not sure but the police will have to stay in the lane you were in .
i do n't believe it .

yeah we still have a 401k with some matching funds available depending on length of service .
that s true . some people don t have to pay for their own homes . many of the market have also been planted in the past the past . also the government is to take care of the road .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .

ok . we offer a personal automobile consumer loan . the maximum is a loan for our imports . the general manager will give you a certificate and the loan is the lowest interest rate in the agreement .
i see . so what about you ? how long will it take to get to you ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months we will have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
