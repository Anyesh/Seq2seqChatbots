but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

yes it is . there are many stereotypes i have to deal with in my daily life .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada for 110 of the price of the real thing .

it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you have a seat in the right corner .
i 'd like to buy a skirt .

i agree how much ?
i think you are the right candidate for the position .

so how about an aperitif ?
let me see . yes it 's a genuine bonnet .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .

ok i m going in a second .
what do you mean by that ?
mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
what do you think about the food ?
how long does it take ?
yes i do . i do n't know very much about them . is it near the university ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m going to let you know that i ve been going to the gas station .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
what sort of work did you check out ?
yes sir . how may i be of service ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry . so i 'll buy you a new one .
is she strict ?
what did you do ?
do n't worry about that . your english education is a definitely good employee . i 'm sure you 'll be able to contact the people .
thank you .
can you give me a call when you have done ?
thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with white sauce ?
what 's the problem ?
are you scared of anything ?
we have found them . may i have your name ?
what 's wrong with the job ?
you are booked on the on at <unk> pm to hong kong with cathy pacific .
so then why do n't you drive it ?
you 're going to need to get a few pounds for the first half .
oh it 's the same in america .
right . we have no children so far as we know on this stage .
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
well i hope i do n't have any time to make up .
i ve been thinking and well i think we need to start seeing other people .
did she go to the magic kingdom ?
you do n't need a holiday .
i see . sorry i have only tables in this hotel .
i 'm not sure . i just want to stay at home .
that s right .
you should take their advice . do n't worry . they will be successful .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
i hope you have a good sleep .
there 's quite a long list actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses medical expenses any internal payments .
so that means i can get a pitcher this time ?
i will just be right back with your kitchen .
what does she look like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . i believe we can do something out .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . please book it for me .

yes ! i was in the bank at the time that i am here to pick out some special presents for my family and my family .

what 's your favorite dance ?
this is a good habit . i usually watch so much in the evening .
here we are .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at s department store .
what are you primarily interested in ?
i was denied a visa ?
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . if it 's broken i 'll never buy anyone a new one . . .
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
can you tell me how to do that ?
because i 'm not really interested in them .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
the problem is that all our everyone needs is a little high on the certificates .
it 's only a couple of minutes . for example you should go to the hotel as much as you can .
we ? do you want to go with me ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
i haven t seen you for several days .
well let 's meet at 12 thirty .

why are n't you so pessimistic ?
is there anything i can do ?
sure . this brand is supposed to be very good but they 're expensive . those are new products . they come in several colors and sizes . there is also hard soft and medium .

have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?

can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
we have a problem with your apartment . what else ?
how about oil or spray ?
yes i would .
what time would you like to take the test ?
i 'd like to check it out .

your flight takes off at 8

i 'm not busy on the weekend . i have to get up early tomorrow .
yes . please write down your address and phone number and sign here .
what is the earliest one ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
but dad i do n't want to waste time on me .
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i already have some idea .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
you 'd better take it with me .
it 's going to be 55 .
i do n't know . i 'll take them .
what kind of soup would you like ?
oh they look delicious .
where do you want to eat it ?
i like these . they are ripe and soft .
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
well we just got in some mangoes .

well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .
i 'll take a dozen .
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

i believe you will .
that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .
yes it 's not big enough . we should be there by ourselves .

i d like to but i can t . my mother s brother is very big .
yes . i would like a very quiet apartment .

please take me to this address .

you 're kidding ! i 'll go back to you later .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?

thank you very much .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
yes .
thank you . we 'll take the taxi .
yes i am . i really do n't know anyone but i 'm going to help me .
what 's your name ?
sure . do you want to have a refund with your b account ?
sure thing .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
sounds good . do you have any questions about your company ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
yeah . do you know where the ring is ?
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back then ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the center of the center of the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
i think i 'd like to buy one please .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello alice ! how are you ?
hi linda . i like you .
i am terribly sorry i did n't realize that .
great . thank you .
not too much . i 've been busy lately .
how have you been ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
i am glad to hear that .
see you soon .
i am completely serious .
i have been working here for 5 years .
i have to take a look at your job .
i have a lot of homework to do . i 'll talk to my manager and let him know .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah i know . but it 's really hard to find a game that is n't true .
that means he was n't interested in other schools .
but it 's too early to be late for school .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
wow ! i like it ! it 's great to do things here .
i think it s a good idea . put the car into the trunk and it will be on the sunny side .
i understand .
all you ever do is have a lower promise . you ll be happy that you are able to make it .
what do the price mean ?
can you play table tennis ?
oh ! i guess we are n't going to have a dog or a cat .
cool ! what kind of games do you like ?
what ? why ? what s wrong ?
i m looking for a sweater .
are you a small gift for a clerk ?
hmm . i ll take a look . may i see what i have ?
are you sure ?
which side do you want to have ?
sure i will get right on it .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
how much does that cost ?
how about this one ? it 's a little tight .
i m not sure about that . i d like to have a look at what the picture of an mp s .
! sentences poems habeas en !
i don t think that s a cool idea . what else does it have ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
i think you 'll wear it too .
let s have the problem .
here we are .
i might be too excited to hear about this .
you are welcome !
hello may i have a double cheeseburger ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
yes . are you going to take care of those items ?
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh ok .
there 's information on deposit or loan rates exchange rates . . .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have rib eye and sirloin steak . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find this book .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem a couple of and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
what about this one ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
why is that ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how long is the system taking a really long time ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well it 's a little bit expensive . i do n't think it 's perfect for a while .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a personal firewall and many restaurants and many other problems . there are also very c .
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no don t allow me to transfer this .
awesome !
i was told to put a sales manager in a different departments .
did you come in and visit the factory ?
well why don t you come to the gym and see how your summer evenings ?
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . i guess it s pretty fresh and clean .
i can t stand the loud noise in the apartment all day !
it sure does . but if you want to live in a bit maybe you 'll just want to pay for the price .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes we have many different kinds of scarves here . i ll show you how to use them .
how long is your vacations like this ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it does . just make sure you want to be the careful of your meals .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
wow ! the view is so fast .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get a few new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you . i think it 's enough to pay for this house .
it s nice to meet you too .
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
well i ve got some money .
we can t put a discount on it .
only ten percent of the amount you please .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you please reconsider ?
okay . i ll write you a ticket for this .
it is that hard to say . i really love the job .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything is .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah so i will buy some souvenirs .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
what style would you like ?
an ordinary one . i want to have a look at this pair .
yes i have several pairs of this one .
i don t think the price is too high .
i ll buy an expensive suit .
fine . what are you doing now ?
yes . i can t wait to see the old styles of summer . i m sure they will be very happy .
one .
how about all ? they are very nice and bright .
it 's a good idea . what about shoes ?
i m happy to hear that .
the dress is over there .
hold on please .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think i can have a better idea . also i like the light colors and the air .
i 'm happy to hear that . i 'll come here to see you then .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
no i think i know what you mean . i find it there is no other place to pick up . maybe a price of five houses that is right . it 's on the other floor so there are lots of people .
your luggage is ready to be ready by the few minutes .
thank you .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
let me see . yes it 's right now .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . i had no idea our advertising was so . it s pretty new .
great idea !
perhaps you re right .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
i think that 's a little too long .
i want to check it out .
the area can be a bit rough in the evenings .
i like the sound . i 'll take it .
right now many people are on the list of things that are from our lives there .
you can find an expensive suit !
let s look at the menu first . oh there s a lovely view from the balcony . would you like to try it on ?
oh your kick is off now .
i know . i should take a look at the colors in the back .
my god ! it 's a big outdoor place .
great . i like the climb .
the master suite is the best . let s go look at that next .
ok sir . we will cancel your reservation .
that s the aroma of coffee beans .
i am the manager . what can i do for you ?
hello this is the property manager . i was calling about the apartment . how are you ?
i need to see that happens .
well i would be glad to .
i will help you with that .
i 'm afraid i have n't got enough money on the phone .
good luck !
i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood . can you give me a call ?
we have a deal of other people like that .
thank you .
we only need to get rid of the stick .
i 'd like to buy a skirt .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
ok . do you have any questions about your work ?
yes .
what 's your name ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
what 's your name ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh really ? what about tomorrow ? are you planning to do it ?
yes i want to have the same haircut that i do n't care for .
oh my god ! why do n't you wash it here ?
i 'd like to cut it to the back . would you like to take a look at it ?
do you like this style ?
i think the style will last . i 'm just not in fashion now .
you are the one i have been here for 10 years . this is a routine check . if you do n't mind sharing an interview with someone else i 'd like to talk to the director with them .
you are right . you are a tour of the whole nation . the <unk> of the entire body .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes .
what 's your name ?
i feel sorry for you . i ve been having problems with this .
i totally agree with you . it 's not bad at all .
yes sir . i bet it 's a little tight .
you can always make a sandwich .
i 've got a little short .
yes i do . what do you mean ?
you can get a burger and some chinese food .
i must admit that i like the story . it 's very smart .
what 's the problem ?
do you have a flat or a small place ?
say hello to your family for me . i 'm glad you like it .
ok let 's go .
ok i will think of that .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
ok i do .
our house is really tough .
when i 'm home i 'll take my money .
that 's great !
i have a few friends from here . will you take a look at your company ?
ok let 's go .
is there a good location to get rid of the old carpet ?
where 's that ?
i could n't find a job .
i was fired last week .
ok i will try my best .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually why not ? the rush was worth it .
i want to help you prepare for your presentation .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
you are right . i love chinese food .
well i am wondering if you like it .
well did you like the tour of universal studios ?
i like the soy sauce chicken .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with your friend ?
actually i 've only got married once . but i know it 's a long time .
so do i . you do n't like them ?
i like drinking tea at home .
oh ! you do n't know much about a place of course . i 'd like to try some new italian food .
mmmm . . . i like chinese cuisine . do n't you ?
it 's getting to be well with your food .
of course i can find it . but you need to get it fixed .
well i 'm a little short on cash .
yes i know . i need to get some warm clothes for my summer clothes . i need to know more about this .
ok . i will try my best . here is the money . but what if i do n't call the customer first item ?
you can send email to each other every day through the website .
alright . and what is the charge ?
you re welcome .
maybe you could try a thai facial and see what the price is .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
your price has gone up sharply has n't it ?
well we promise that each of the buy will take off soon .
what time do you go ?
they are short i think .
are there any other advantages ?
yes go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i like the fashion . i like street more than the others .
i do n't know . it 's a good idea . why do n't you come ?
then you 're a club .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i guess i usually do well and then go to the post office to the teachers .
the five months ago the birth date is very limited .
you are smart . i have a very good taste . would you mind taking a look at the menu ?
the fee is 25 every time you overdraft .
i think it 's a good idea . but they have many fun too .
fine . please call me if you need any help .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
sure . do you have your receipt ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks and public relations .
i did n't mean to . something unexpected in shanghai have come up . i have to do a lot of things .
go and try not to too .
well do n't do you think i could borrow the car for a while ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
well i do n't have any in my size here . i 'll take them .
ok . is it now ?
it 's ok .
i 'm afraid not sir . i ca n't be able to deliver the goods by march .
thank you . i will wait over there .
i 'm sorry mr . sandals but i 'm afraid i ca n't find a new suitcase .
here you are .
thank you . please fill out this paperwork .
thank you very much .
well . the price can be talked over there .
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
did you get any cold medication ?
i do n't have any other choices .
do you have a fever ?
it 's not the only thing that is n't it ?
you are right . almost all top brands such as mcdonald 's and kfc are from america .
my friends and i are planning on having a barbecue right now . do you want to come with me ?
what are we talking about ?
i hope i can get my films there .
oh yeah i guess i 've got it . thanks !
really ? i got to go now . it 's hard to keep your food clean .
yes i will .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
yeah it s right ! you know it is a traditional chinese food . you know i am a junior but i have a new french fries and a strong taste . .
i usually watch a lot of television before i go to bed .
yeah you are right . not everyone has a good taste . do n't eat any sugar or caffeine .
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do some jogging on your mind . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
mainly plastics . plastics aren t <unk> they don t break down easily in the environment so they should n't be thrown away .
last time we have a big breakfast or a glass of lemonade . more than a glass of lemonade . more than that other people are coming to celebrate your birthday with a glass of wine .
of course . i 'll try chinese food .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
it 's ok to me .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like the soy sauce chicken .
well it 's an excellent chinese teacher . the doctor says you should get yourself into the class .
yeah my roommate likes to watch me play .
it 's just that you are looking forward to seeing them .
sure . . . alright . tell me a diet coke please .
well we 'd better make sure that our clients are very good .
thank you you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
sure . you can log off to a website browse through many crazy methods .
it 's not a good deal . it 's really cheap .
i guess you are right . if i did n't have any sense of responsibility this weekend would n't be able to keep me fit .
no thanks . i 'd like tea .
6 . 30 is good at them . i 'm glad we 've had a good time .
sounds good . i 'll try that .
yeah why not ? it 's a bit too long .
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you want to cook some kebabs ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please .
of course . what are you going to do ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
you 're not going to cook ?
i know but i 'm really hungry .
what are you going to cook ?
i was thinking of pizza .
that sounds good . i 'll bring you a hot one .
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
did you enjoy cooking ?
do n't go to too much trouble .
did you say anything ?
do we have a big time ?
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
i want some chocolate .
ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
you 're right . i do n't know .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
you 're right . we should get some beer first .
i 'm going to have a glass of beer .
<unk> . it 's a secret .
i 'm going to put you in a few minutes .
i do n't know what to order .

but i 'm going to add a beer to the taste .
do you want to order anything else ?
no i 'm not eating .
what do you drink ?
well i 've also got a lot of sweet dishes .
what are you thinking ?
blue one and the other eye shadow of the world .
would you like some more ?
what about this one ? it 's very smart .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
thank you .
no thanks . i 'm thinking of buying some ice cream .
what about some ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
i do n't have the slightest clue what i want .
how much do you have ?
yes you are right . but not sugar forward to it . you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
yes you are right ! ! on the other hand i m afraid i must be too fat .
french dressing .
do you want to get a large order ?
yes you are right . but i m serious . you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink a lot of milk that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !

i do n't think so . i 've got plenty of food .
ok . but do you have a credit card ?
this is a special restaurant .
sure . i 'll take some tablets that should n't make . is that all right ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't . i have to go to the hotel right now .
well we have a few choices of filet mignon medium rare blood pressure .
do you want anything to go with the chicken ?
ok . can i serve you anything else ?
yeah right ! wait for the recipe ! we should cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !

yes it 's not far away from here .
well do n't you know for sure ?
i have no idea where to find one .
you do n't think you could be wrong ?
it 's a block away down the street .
we could take the subway but we 'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
the 486 .
do n't worry . we can not find a different way .
there are a few signs with a lot of information about the city sights .
really ? i think you 'll be able to enjoy the city in the summer .

i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i don t understand what the big deal is .
what s the problem ?

the system crashed when i was surfing on the internet .
i m going to send someone out to fix it .
it s this tuesday .

i will be right back .
i like it but i m a bit tired .

i wrote the check out for way too much .
i don t understand what the big deal is .
i heard that you moved to florida .
i d like to confirm my reservation . i can call you back in two days .
i 'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .

no . are you having a meeting with her ?
you did n't see the red ones ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
do you have any idea how much that 'll cost ?
there is a garage sale around the corner .
but it is very far from here .
the same to you .
we have to get off the bus station for about one .
i 'm in a good mood actually . how about you ?
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem . so how are you finding your new boss ?
i 've never been to the public park .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no by train . i think it 's much safer than bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you want a cup ?
that 's because i do n't know .
no problem .
you should get off on the first floor .
how about going to the cinema ?
oh yeah . they 're coming on the right .
you can always make a sandwich .
i do n't think you 'll see it .
how much do you have ?
i 'm not sure but i 'm very careful about that .
i am not convinced by the explanation .
i m serious .
i am sorry but you did n't .
i do n't understand why i 'm going to be late .
hi george . it 's a wonderful wedding is n't it ?
i 'm reading a book about a friend of mine .
that 's wonderful !
no i 'm not . i 'm only here for one .
thank you for your love and care over the years . i think you 'll be a good fit .
i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .
do they do a good job on the food ?
there 's nothing else i can do about my work . i have to get back to my boss .
a point is a surprise . i think you 'll be a good manager .
i 'm sorry i made you disappointed . i 'm just not sure i 'll be able to fall in love with you .
oh yes it is . thank you very much .
well i 'm glad to help .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
i hope that we can get together again next week .
well i still have a lot of work . i 'm waiting for my call .
really ? well in that case you should n't have thought of it . it 's true that we were together .
really ? oh what 's that ?
ok i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
which one would i recommend ?
peter i told you that she had made a mistake .
you are so kind . thank you .
yes we have many kinds of books here . would you like to help me with your luggage ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what kind of soup would you like ?
can you tell me how to operate it ?
how do you keep fit ?
my motherinlaw just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight .
what 's your name ?
i was denied a visa ?
well i hope it s all too hard to say .
i was talking to you about a girl .
i agree with you but i think he seems to have no problem .
i think i want to try a new style .
if he does n't know what can he 's doing ?
i have been studying english for 6 years .
i understand . why did you put it off ?
i 'd like to go . where are you going ?
what 's your name ?
next month .
oh it 's a secret .
what 's your favorite course daniel ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
yes i know . and that 's the most important thing . i feel uncomfortable when i 'm in a hurry .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
how much is all ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i will be there .
you 're right . we 'll take it .
i think i know because this happened before .
you know i am about to still a father . i have to find a parttime job .
could you tell me the way to the peak tram please ?
i know a lot about chinese food . but these are more serious .
do you think we 'll need them while we are here ?
fine ! how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm planning to live in my hometown . what about you ?
of course i have . the most important thing is to do is to make sure the people will be happy to do the same .
i see . do you have any other advantages ?
let 's see . i 'm going to the library .
goodbye . see you then .
do n't believe it . i will try .
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
no problem . i 'm always learning english when i was a little .
i was fired last week .
i think so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
i think so . the most difficult thing is that you can write your english experience . also i need to take a lot of english you . they say would be happy to write english more english with language .
i 'm dead serious about this .
that 's all right . thanks for your help .
i have n't been to the mall in a long time .
well do you have a local degree ?
thanks a lot .
i was fired last week .
how can i get there ?
an old one ?
that 's exactly what i thought . i only hope it would be a little expensive .
we have a carol with various plants from all over the world . just pick up the hold of the office and turn left .
so i do n't have to put my resume in the paper ?
trust me .
so your parents must be very happy to get along with them . do you think they could ask you more personally ?
you are right .
i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what about you ?
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .
how did you get any honors ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
is it very expensive ?
and i suppose i 'm a <unk> .
she 's very nice .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
ok i ll take it . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
well i will send someone to fix it .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . how much is the fare ?

i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
um . . . i m not sure . they re my favourite slogan for a long time .
what about the west lake ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
news ? what 's that ?
well i was born and raised in london but i had no interest in the international business so i would like to do that .

they 're quite reasonable . it 's above nick 's head
i know what you mean . i 've started learning how to take every chance but i can t take classes .

maybe you are right . but i still think the father had better .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
all right . here is the latest fashion .

it 's been bad for the past several months . but my boss was very busy and i had an evening visiting her parents .
i 'm so sorry man . i did n't know that you were angry .
did she have a lot of homework ?
oh how awful !

your present job is something better . why do you change ?

what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
you ll be able to easily find something that way on the motor vehicles office .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
well then may i try it ?
i was fired last week .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
that 's a great idea . let 's go to a bar and sing some karaoke .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
that 's alright . but you really should have another drink . people will probably start dancing soon .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
you 're a good dancer .
i see .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
i 'm so sorry . it was the fault .
i was too excited to go to sleep . i was worried about how my son was .
do you think you ll be able to come in at the beginning of the month ?
sure what do you need ?
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
never mind . it 's my pleasure .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
then you have to get up early tomorrow .
no that 's not enough . it 's just my nose . i ca n't see it .
how about this steak ? i do n't know how to get any .
well it 's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays .
well here 's your 1000 rib . i 'll have to pay for it .
i 'm fine thank you .
sir our guests are our guests .
sure . do you have the same thing with you ?
how are the trousers ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
she 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
maybe you re right . there s a big department store . it s in summer s very comfortable .
yes here you are .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
not today . i was really expecting it .
you can exchange it in anything else .
what about the one ? i think it 's too small for me .
then my son drove into a tree .
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hi this is monica . i want to speak to your department .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i can understand .
don t be angry with me . i ll always bring a drink .
you know that i could use a chance to finish this job . i ll see what i have to do .
oh how about the new there ? they are much cheaper than in a band sale now .
does it always close at six ?
we should be here more minutes .
oh i am sorry to hear that . why do n't you ask someone to help you ?
well i ll be glad to make it . i hope you ll be able to deliver by next week at eight o clock .
how much is that ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you tell me about some more ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine .
ugh . . . how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i had a bad day yesterday .
i was late to work today .
great ! that s great . you ve got a really good commend of short stories . i m glad to ask you .
but i not not to take the plane today .
you know that i care for you . i hope you ll be happy to join us .
don t put your hands on it .
you think ?
yes . good for you .
if we re going to live on a business trip !
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you .
great ! they are the highest ones i m looking forward to something like that !
i hope we can do something soon .
oh . that means it will get to know within the long run .
oh shut up ! you are all right .
i 'm not ready for it but let 's just go to sleep .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's great ! will it be hard to care for ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
a necklace ?
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
have you ever been behind your work ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the ball is coming right up .
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how about all this ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
why is that ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
while you re cleaning the cooker i ll wipe the worktop . that was a great meal .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m sorry but you can t make it . i ve got to go back an hour ago .
i do n't think so . i am just not certain .
i think that s what i m doing . i think i should get a pair of glasses instead of burning off the candle .
anyway i think i m gonna need a nose and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you just don t play your <unk> . i know what to do !
be honest honey . you are a lifesaver .
what you said is absolutely right ! i just lost a red light and my hair is so easy !
yes . you really deserved this .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
not at all . i get that . i ll take it .
wait a minute ! i m starving !
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of money in mind ?
ok but you should be tired because i m not more than talking to them .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i see . thank you .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you have any other plans for the next year ?
i did n't know you were a vegetarian .
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
no . is n't the news for me ?
ha ! i know what you mean . . .
thanks a lot . i 'm glad you are doing it .
thank you . enjoy your stay with us .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .

goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm not being angry with you . i just think i 'm ready to get a girl dressed .
it 's not your fault . i am not the only guy who is in the mood for the whole day . besides you can have the idea of the bread you want . it 's too late for the inconvenience .
you 're right ! she 'll be very happy about that .
well you have all your point . i think you 'll be a good match !
i heard it 's his birthday .
yes it can be a little . but you 'd better not have a girlfriend . you know he 'll never do it .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .

i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
alright . you were a good singer .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .

that s pretty heavy for me .
i 'm getting sleepy .

i really hate this weather .

what do you have for the us ?
yes . you really deserved this .
buckle up .
it is very fast and it has a private vehicle .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
the car park in the city is so beautiful .
come on they 're in . these are the fun . anything else ?
yes i did . my family and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . how about you ?

you re a thief vicki . but i will watch you on your plate .
oh you know the ones that are the ones that i mean . they 're the groom 's niece and nephew . let 's see . oh they 're the ! so much better than the real human beings .
i 'm not so sure they look very attractive .

that 's a fantastic question . we got the ball drop by a few people .
me too . do you want to come by and watch the ball ?

yes . which side of the fans are not very fresh and efficient to keep them cold .
yes . you really deserved this .
that 's good !
i m serious .
good idea !
thank you ! but what did you do yesterday ?
there is a fire on the sidewalk . it is cute .
there were one of the main ones that i list of all of them .
oh i remember . he had a parttime job as a stock analyst .
oh ! i thought you were just a bit out of such a child .
yeah it sure is . so i guess the game is best for this year .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
well i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's a dishonest man . i tried to give him a ring as a locker but i did n't think it was that match .
oh i thought it was a bit strange . do you have a stopwatch ?
let me see . oh that 's a mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . we have a few different conditions of that we had a really good time .
that was easy ! it was easy to see eye on the map .
sure i 'm finished .
how much is it ?
you 're under arrest for that . and i can help you with that .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . i think i 'll talk to her again .

sue john smith .

what 's the color of her eyes ?
so you 're a teacher ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
no . i 'm just thinking of it . do you want to go ?
that must be a strange thing .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . i like reading books best songs . it 's so exciting .
i m afraid you re pretty romantic .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
well the costumes and the set are marvellous but the acting is a bit stiff . what do you think ?
so what do you think of them ?
i 'll give you two clues . first it cost more than 250 . and second it 's not big .
how are the batteries in your life ?
it s quite cold today .
sounds like an interesting job . how can you tell me about this ?
if you do n't like the insurance premium can be done by regular insurance . and the insurance policy covers you against and . that should be a packing within a couple of days .
you mean that i have n't seen her yet .
really ? i want to be great .
mm . . . there 's also one hundred and twenty .
oh the day after tomorrow ?
no i think harry will get it .
so that is .

it 's so true .
i could n't agree with you more .
why do n't you try the wooden ones ?
no he likes to leave his things about his family .
that 's right . did you get the goods on the menu ?
it s a fun job . i have to work in a training school .
yeah a lot of people think so . after all he should do a lot of good things .
yes some friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried doing those who don t see them ?
sure ! it 's a cool job . a lot of people love singing ! it 's not easy to get a chance to watch .
yeah . people should look out because they are so crazy .

she 's probably just excited about her new job .
i see . a bottle of whisky .
she 's a <unk> professional and a teamplayer . i have utmost confidence in her abilities .
oh that 's why i am interested in renting a way .

the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
to get the ball rolling in the world market .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t know . i could n't believe it !
a large collections is n't it ?
the score is 10198 .

i 'm throwing a party on friday .
it 's only ten minutes away . have you seen him ?
he did n't do that .
yes . i have some problem with my work .
what 's the problem ?
okay . i 'll leave the message . i 'll call him later .
it 's just that he is a hard worker . do you know what he was doing ?
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
the score was 10198 .
that 's a romantic . he was also a student in the united states .
do n't worry . you can make it when you come out .
it was n't the right time .
yes it 's right . what 's the big name ?
yeah . i know him . but he 's a genius .
he 's not kidding . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour now ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
is it possible to speak to you ?
i 'm a bit confused . why do you ask ?
that 's a good idea . you 'd better try some more italian food .
actually i am interested in cooking where i can eat my favorite food .
it 's about an hour s drive .
do you know of any banks near here ?
good luck .
thank you ! i will .
i would like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .

i have been working here for 5 years .
i have to take a look at your job .
i have a lot of homework to do . i 'll talk to my manager and let him know .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah i know . but it 's really hard to find a game that is n't true .
that means he was n't interested in other schools .
but it 's too early to be late for school .
i 'll see you tomorrow then .
i 'll be there .
i do n't know what to make .
i do n't know . i like this one .
what kind of music do you like ?
they 're really wonderful . i want to enjoy watching them on tv .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i guess you can get a motorcycle or an expensive bathroom .
no i do n't like him . he s a good singer . he works well with a friend .
the next game is interesting and i think it 's that we should be able to enjoy the clean before the meal .
sure . it is . the winter is the symbol of the city 's arrival .
oh we had a lot of time . he was the most awful evening i had n't want to be able to do .
i think you need to get a job that i needed to get the idea of some kind of bad blood .
he is n't a punctual person . he just likes to get things done next week .
yes he was . i like him to be our director .
what 's your name ?
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
did n't they hurt you ?
she said she would be in shopping with a friend of mine .

it 's a good thing to speak with a friend .
oh . what a surprise !
i was denied a visa ?
did he leave when you left ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but i probably ca n't accept your behavior .
you were right it was from a headhunter . he would n't tell me anything without a contract .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i do n't think so . thank you .
yes .
i 'm not sure . let me see . . . do you want to listen to your of course ? it 's on the third floor .
i am a fan of dancing club . i think it 's a good idea .
that 's his greatest chinese teacher .
yes you 're right . and i agree with you .
it 's very convenient .
that 's really good . you 'll have to take a look at the pamphlet .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
what 's the problem ?
no but i heard that she had a fight with her husband .
i had a similar experience but i didn t take the way to the bathroom .
have you thought about going in dutch ?
yes i know her . she is a teacher of aerobics .
i think it was too big .
i had a good idea to get the chores done .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
sir i would love to help you out but you are not allowed to eat it .
delighted i was able to help .
i like your positive attitude . how do you get along with the game ?
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
yes .
ok . mr . smith . i have a meeting from japan at 11 . 30 am . and i will call you in charge of the office .

why is that ?
why is it so ?
no it is n't . i 'm sorry .
that 's great ! i 've been making a lot of friends here for the last few days .

but i bought it in the refrigerator .
i mean you can t smoke a day ?
wow ! i do n't want to play in the internet like this . i can imagine how to play it out .
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you can just take it from the curb colors .
the next meeting will be closed at 8
oh yes . the red one has a very hot springs . it is very expensive and it has many restaurants .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
i 'm sure i will . we hope you will have a good time here .
there 's a number of reasons .
thank you . oh tell me !
well i know it 's a hard job so i 'm not sure the price is .
it depends on the weight of your bus .
that 's amazing . i like the house and the house in the suburbs .
yes . it will be ready by 2 p . m . so i can get in time .
you can keep the apartment if you like . that 's the best we can do .
ok . i 'll be right back .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's the notice ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how long have you been learning this kind of butterfly style ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
thanks . what shall we do now ?
have you seen the samples ?
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it 's a game .
that 's true . but do you know you can t miss it ?
we have to pay now .
i was fired last week .
i m very sorry .
i will .
never ?
yes . you really deserved this .
it is such a nice place .
sure . i 'm ready to order .
which one is cheaper ?
do n't be silly . i can t seem to make it .
actually you have n't have much .
black coffee
that 's right . do you have a morning flight to rome ?
i 'm afraid i do n't know . i 've got a contract with you .
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out . maybe my luck will get better .
sounds interesting . what do you think ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
why didn t you phone me from a ?
no not really . i was busy with my work .
really ? did you get hurt ?
yes i did .
it 's great to know what you 're doing .
well now i 'm not finished with the flu . there 's a lot of noise out .
over there are stacy and rebecca . we 're all on the school 's tennis team .
to buy more than the party it 's beautiful !
i think it is easy . i 'll talk to you later .
no it 's all yours .
well you see . i do n't like the office . i do n't like the staff . and i 'm afraid you and i do n't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
what ?
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
disco is my favorite . i have a favorite dance to be a lot of people . but i 'm not sure whether the best is n't good .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's fun . but i can like the old styles .
no i do n't think much of a person .
sure . rather than eating having a good taste of dance .
that 's just a lot of noise when you face difficulties .
well . that s why i think that many people think that are so important !
yes in china they are all animals and there are many interesting <unk> . and they are also the only one .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
generally speaking training new members is usually quite reasonable and the staff have enjoy themselves in western europe . they enjoy the meal and the foods .
that s good . what about the subjects for your minor ?
let 's see . i think there are many people here .
you are right ! this is the built !
it 's so exciting .
i know a lot of people love it . do you have any hobbies ?
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
that 's nice . but i 'm afraid i like dancing .
i do n't know . let 's go to the dance floor .
all kinds of music are exciting to dance .
then you must be interested in disco .
yes i like . i 'm very tired .
how do you like the game ?
we 're going to have a party tonight .
really ? let 's go to bed and get a good sleep .
yes i like it very much .
what about your books ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
yes . in fact i do n't dance very often .
i 'm glad to help you .
i agree . i 'll bring it up by tomorrow .
i ve been accepted !
maybe . but i think the lion dance is a bit too difficult .
no . the rock and roll of fast tempo .
does your mother have a good vcr ?
yes . you 're a very good dancer .
we 're going to need a hand .
oh really ? i do n't know so . i 'm just going to the gym right now .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
mmmm . . . it 's hard to say . i like golf a i guess i like tennis better .
well then what about the sports package ?
no but i do n't know where it is .
oh i see . what a pity ! i 'm not a professor united states . i do n't know why i ca n't write a strike .
i would n't mind having a look at the thermometer ! the car has hit the sky .
what floor is the dining room ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
can you get it ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what about this one ?
spring .
may i take it ?
i am not surprised to hear you say so . we are supposed to be here for a long time .
it 's certainly a big snow once in a while . i 'm fond of the city .
it 's so cold here .
oh i see . by the way is it possible for you to visit the summer palace ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it starts at 8 o 'clock .
are there any seats available ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
why not ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
follow me ! there are many mountains here . we are many different places in the southern part of the united states .
that 's true . it 's always cold in the middle of summer .
i wonder how about a wash and the vegetables ?
yes the weather is so warm .
well it 's a little smaller than the others .
you look so young .
i forgot it too .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not a problem at all . the door is too heavy .
i ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
i 'm so glad that you did a good job . i thought you had some very good time .
what do you think of it ?
sure what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
i will be back again next wednesday .
it 's time for a picnic .
i 'll pick you up then .
yes . i have no plans .
what 's the matter ?
i 'd love to .
are you going to cook it ?
have you ever been to the club ?
this morning . i mean . . .
ok we 'll see you at 6 thirty .
thank you for calling .
it is a great way to spend a lot of time with my family .
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i think the government is the policy that many people believe that they will have to carry on with us .
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
i do n't care .
no thank you . i think it 's enough for dinner .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well let me know when i get it fixed . i ll just have to cancel it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
did you have a good time here ?
you re welcome .
will you be paying with cash check ?
oh thanks ! my name is doctor .
does he have any other symptoms ?
yes he does . he s a nice girl .
do you want to be a message ?
it 's freezing .
it looks like you 're just a little bit oldfashioned . that 's what i should do .
then i 'll try to make it the first time .
oh i m sorry i can t . i ve had a date already .
do n't worry . it 's been a little early . you 'll have to take the taxi .
of course . i 'm not a chicken anymore .
how many of you have ?
you know what ? i do n't get a chance to see it for myself .
they re in the united states .
my family has got married right ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
you too . thanks .
it 's a pleasure .
thanks goodbye .
i hope so . thank you for your cooperation .
you must feel really worried right now . but you know your dad is a fighter .
you are welcome and i apologize for the inconvenience .
that 's pretty much what i want to do .
but i just want to tell her that santa is actually better than her s first .
yes . . .
that 's really surprising .
you can t just throw me out on the street ! you can t just try it !
i 'd love to . it 's a little too expensive for me .
ok let 's get together by the end of next week .
i know life is not all roses and i believe i will pull this through .
you should consider a court appearance .
i think it is better for me to get my master s degree .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . the problem is that there are not enough buses to get dry food .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'll be back in a sec .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was . the movie producer the director the director of the movie producer very well .
you mean you studied at the beginning of next semester ?
i guess i might .
yes it 's not only that simple . people are sure you could find something similar in this magazine .
how do you think of this job ?
which side of your job did you have ?
i know but i bought it in the store . i was in the same color as it was casual and strong .
well it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
absolutely . it was really interesting .
yes . but we like the design of digital products . you see the sign on the screen and it 's our fault .
really ? this one is so beautiful .
i hope it 's comfortable .
oh maybe i could teach you how to cook something healthy and make some chinese .
i think you should go to the airport to see a doctor .
as we said they should be careful not have the same name of our company .
i ca n't agree more . we could possibly meet at least provide for free days .
sure . let s rock n roll .
yes you are right .
i 'm in the market to offer a fair price in the future .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
oh come on . that 's all .
no . it 's not very much .
yeah . i was lost all the time . but i still ca n't believe it .
they are all the same .
i know but i 'm just not so sure that our little thing could be a little crazy .
yes they did . i was n't there . they were all the animals and birds and squirrels . i think that was a big fan of winning a small kids .
oh gosh ! i did n't know . i have to go to the bathroom !
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
i see . mr . sandals can you tell me how many employees you have in each office ?
the milk was too big .
oh i 'm sorry but i 've already got my help . i need to go to the gym right now .
yeah . we can eat breakfast for you .
the hours just before the departure time .
oh i did n't know that . it was a pity i did n't realize it was that loud .
then my son drove into a tree .
good idea . a wrapping that will be a good trip !
do you think i could put this off ? i m going to put them in a bit of a terrible .
alright . i think we ll go .
she 's in the garden jane .
have you been working there ?
i think it 's about 12 years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she 's in the store .
no i didn t sleep well last night .
ok i see . do you want to come at the restaurant ?
yes . i have one .
what 's your name ?

well they are 168 .
hello mr . li . what is your name again ?
yes they are .
hello miss li hong . what is your name please ?
it 's a difficult question . but i can teach you how to use the software .
really ? that sounds interesting .
yes she is .
is it very cold in the cold print ?
what 's going on ?
it s really good .
i think we should have a more free life here .
thank you .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .

there 's a spot open next to the public restroom .

then i will send her the staff to see you off . would you be able to call her ?
i hope you can come .
but you just have to get a pet like that . it 's too fast for your health .
but i want to tell her that she is pretty .
yeah . oh yes .
sure . i ll give it a try .
yes a lot of friends .
did you stay a little longer ?
i 've got to go .
ok . i see it now . thank you for your help .
can you tell me what you 'll do ?
yes i will see the bus .
where is your polling place ?
all right . if you really do something about your hands i ll get an appointment .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
cheer up ! it 's not the only thing to him !
yeah . what 's he like ?
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's 24 .
why do n't we go to visit them ?
but i do n't want to be my boyfriend .
yes . i have already given her a list of all the times . i would never be able to control my temper .
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
i think so . it 's very interesting .
we can do that . and what are you thinking of ?
the hardcover is more expensive .
the performance is excellent .
why do you have all the questions ?
he 's really reserved normally .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
i feel like having some dumplings . let 's go out to eat .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i wish i could stay here .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
i think it 's dangerous . what about a lift ?
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i 'm going to put some red chilli on it .
will you come here soon ?
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow morning ?
great ! that 'll be ahead of schedule ! good work .
yes i wanted to live in the southern part of the third country .
we 're going to put in a new position soon .
i d like to but i m afraid i can t .

i will be getting to the place right now .
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's very easy to carry .

i 'll tell them . when did they get here ?
i 'm sorry . when did you get your phone ?
i really like the food .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it because of the bad weather ?
i was fired last week .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
hi lily this is malia and i will be able to help you with the new work .
thank you . i am glad that you are enjoying it .
i have lived here for twenty years .

well thank you very much .
how many cigarettes do you have ?
come on ! a little labor much health .
are you having any dessert ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yeah i had a wonderful time .
since last night .
you know that i married .
i have been working for a trust game for 2 years .
we have some catalogues from u . s . universities . you may check in the reference stacks over there .
i 'm majoring in english .
but sir you do n't use to communicate with a simple procedure . all the necessary materials are accepted by this company .
i 'm sure you know what the cost of living costs and how much it is .
yeah i 've been out of town .
where did you empty the basket bill ?
we waste a vacation .
yes . i graduated this past june .
and what do you do for work ?
pretty good .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh there is n't ? oh no .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
no you 're right .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i have found them in a comfortable room .
well i don t know what you mean . we re going to do our own after a picnic .
whatever . just make sure they are all the same .
yes that 's it . she 's pretty conservative .
you must feel very happy now .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . he retired last week . it s turning point in his life .
i do n't believe it . he s a liar .
not bad .
i hope you re right .
he 's been kind of like this for a couple of years .
how can you speak to him ?
how could you explain that ?
yes i know . he 's a already mad at my mother for help .
yes . you can trust him . he always tells the truth .
you do realize that all you have to do was an ambulance .
but it s a great movie .
you have nothing to worry about .
yes she is .
i know but i was thinking of her .
i would n't do it if i were you .
well to be honest i was n't thinking of doing that .
it s a fun job .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i apologize . but they are just terribly sorry .
my car was robbed last night .
you are right .
i m afraid you are being too particular about that .
you can t miss the bus .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
ok . that 's an excellent idea .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
it 's been pretty bad . i just had a cold and i 'm not sure .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
did this just come on ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think i am quite good at planning . i think i am very good at planning .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
do you think you could ask them to buy a pc ?
you 're right . i 'll tell him you 're here .
sorry i wo n't be serious .
what was the score ?
thank you .
our cousin is a little different . we have n't decided yet . it 's too noisy to be around here and i 'm not sure .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . i have them sent to several times . i usually take them back to my family on my own .
why ? do n't you have to go to the flower bed ?
when do you need to take your advice ?
do you know anything about the room ? is she busy ?
i met with the boss at home . i thought it was his wife 's birthday .
well now you know i am about it . i am going to be a lot of fun on you .
i turned it on . but it s quite a bit chilly .
you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i 'm sure you 'll be there .
no problem .
if you refuse to take it you 'll find it easier for us to quit smoking .
well we all get along very well . it seems that we have a lot of fun .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how long have you been feeling ill ?
how do you get along with it ?
he must be green . it 's lucky that you treat her as well .
i am sorry . i thought you were n't going to tell me that .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
really ? but i think he 's really good at his story .
i d like to but i m afraid i can t . my mother s speaking very good at the moment .
i mean i like them all . they re not so young .
i like blue to be very short of my skin .
but sometimes i don t like her butting in different countries .
so what size is the latest ?
what s your favorite flower ?
i 'm not surprised . she is a teacher of aerobics .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . i lost my wallet .
you must have been there .
there 's a 4 persons altogether .
how old is your sister ?
that 's a big family . how old is your sister ?
i did n't get any . i tried to call my host mother but that 's the truth . he had n't get it .
that 's true . well there are a lot of issues to take part in the city .
well one of my other sister and i 'm a child .
let 's get together with his friends and enjoy a guy together .
sure . i know that i get a lot of exercises to keep myself busy .
oh but you know he is n't a bit upset . i always do what to say .
thank you . i m sure you will have a good time .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i will be out all day .

yes that 'd be all right .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .

some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
yes all right .
that 's right . you can buy things at the post office .
i think it s a great idea to describe a little more .
i do n't like italian food . what 's your favorite dish ?
he is a worker .
you are lucky .
yes it is . but i don t think he s broken .
don t worry . you should get them fixed .
oh sorry .
i see . then we ll get together again soon .

i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
what life is it ?
just a minute . i lost your wallet . you re running me out of breath .

we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
tell me about it .
yeah this is the kitchen .
what 's that ?
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's 24 .
let me see . it 's my first class .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
what 's your name ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i know he s going to be the next president .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
ok . but we ll see if we can find something different .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 've made a mistake . this is your luggage on the side of the plane .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever liked it .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
you want to wait for the next bus ?
i wonder how much of the city is down .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i was watching a football match .
let s see . you bought a compact car yourself .
you 're kidding ! he 's not here right now .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?

i will be happy to get you something done so soon . i hope i can finally meet you .
i am a .
don t worry . i ll help you .
i have a low fever .
sure . i m looking forward to it .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about 10 years ago .
i also need some small ground beef and some teriyaki sauce .
that 's great ! will you need to fill out this form ?
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
sure you should attach a good range of suggestion . remember the best way to do is to make the same effort .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
i do n't think we have anything to declare . we have a lot of them in the whole country .
i understand . i do need to pay my bills right ?
thank you . here 's your change and receipt .
is there a car in the city centre ?
it 's ok .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .

no not really . i love going to see them in my life . how about you ?
i would but i 'm a bit tired . my parents have to take me to the beach together .
do n't worry . you 'll be ok soon .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
how sweet . what do you make them like ?
but what do you mean ? i 've never had a child a twin sister a .
so far i 'm hungry . what about you ?
i see . how long does your stay ?
they did n't . they simply talk so loudly that i can learn after my family .
really ? what happened ?
mine are of very traditional chinese dishes . it 's about to eat more and more vegetables are popular now .
why are you taking such a chicken ?
the information is a product that can be used in and i 've seen that many thousand people in the it field .
oh yes i did n't know that .
i see . well my husband and i are very happy to hear that . we should go out and buy more new friends .
oh very interesting .
sorry i 've already been reading them .
is that a dark cloud over there ?
come on . it s been a while since we were together .
ok . i see . well you ve got a big love amy s boyfriend .
my father is a bit oldfashioned . he is only nice and nice .
i like being a dog . he s a dog and a dog .
i am so nervous . i just miss what you see .
how long is it gonna take to get to know her ?
not really . i 'm learning chinese through songs .
really ? i 'm surprised to hear that . you really did n't have to pay the fee right now .
sounds like you would be able to have a pet dog .
oh i see . how can you be so hard to stay with your company ?
she asked me to beef up in the work .
i see . what else should i ask her ?
i know i have to work as an english teacher .

i know . it s about time to watch the star wars game .
that s not for me . it s too expensive for me .
why don t you have a problem with your parents ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip . the air is nice .
you should go now .
well we could go to a movie theater or something . you could get some exercise by working .

no i was out . i 'm really tired of heavy rain .

you are really a good student .
me too . it 's a game for spectators to watch .
do n't you know what kind of sport you can play ?
both . but the children like football and playing basketball .
not really . i do n't like watching games and all .
i see . do you have any other questions about your family ?
well you are a big fan of him . i know you are a guy .
i m a little worried about that . i don t want to be able to lose a job .
sure .
me ? but i do n't think the only way that is the second .
dad i m afraid not ! you re too deep ! you ll be in a hurry !
that s not the reason .
but that is not the only thing that is it 's so romantic !
i see .
sure but i don t like any other questions .
well it 's just some time . you could save some time and go to bed .
i love this art exhibition ! it 's a great way to play .

yes . but it has been 200 years since the last time we got married .
so how are you finding another girl ?
hey look at my sister . she has a bad cold and a lot of things .

i know . they are a little tight .
i 'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're darn right . i 'm already so busy .
i hope so . bye !
then you 'll be in line for everything else . if you 're not careful you 'll probably believe what i 'll be doing . . .
can you tell me how to do that ?
elvin does n't mind me . i 'm never doing anything .
not bad . how about you john ?
fifteen ? ! and i 'm still waiting for them .
i do n't know . it 's a good thing i 've never heard of . maybe it 's just a good thing .
and you can speak english too ?
i think it is pretty cold today .
please think it over .
it s a nice day .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would it outby asking my parents for money .
what did he do ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right .
what did the matter ?
that 's interesting . you can never count on it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i do n't need to be nosey .
that 's true . actually there are many chinese express and so on . you do n't have to carry it with me .

i do n't know . so what about a waste of time ?
are you nuts ? what about you ?
i don t know .
i know ! did you do anything else ?

but i think you should have some confidence in her .
why not ? i am trying to choose a concert .
what 's the problem ?
oh i 'm in a good mood actually . how about you ?
me too !
well the only thing i did was that i ran into him with an friends . it was around the corner where we got all the highest reputation in my life .
absolutely . he 's a liar .
no he did n't want to leave but he said it was too late .
that sounds like a great idea . have you seen there ?
i 'm sorry .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like the foxtrot and tango .
i not really did that .
sorry . i 'll be up in a minute .

good boy . i will help you with that .
let 's do it this afternoon .
sure . show me some .
it 's 1000 p . m . to meet you tomorrow morning .
yes please . do you have any more questions about your closing ?
all right . let 's see when the final is over .
i am glad you could do it .
ah yes i see . do you have any <unk> for your health ?
i will . do you have a trainer to help you ?
yes quite right . there are too many different places . one should be open and is .
yes we do . the only thing i can do is to help when you come back .
good plan . let 's go put some iodine on the hot cap .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
who was your favorite singer ?
it really is a good game . you can go to a many fried fried oysters .
is that a place that you want to come to ?
how ?
would you like some more ?
we can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products .
yeah . he 's the one who had a moustache but just broke down .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes . you really deserved this .
i ca n't believe it . he even looks at the bottom of my life .
yeah . . . well thank you .
i am too ! what can i do to help ? i ca n't believe it !
actually . . . oh yes . . . i thought i was waiting for two .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome ! by the way would you like to have a seat over there ? i know you are very interested in the world of your performance .
nice to meet you i 'm simon . i do n't think i ve seen you around before .
yes . how are you doing ?
where are you from ?
good morning sir !
i hope you will meet our deadline . i 'll have a talk to you after the weekend .
you are very welcome . anything else i can do for you ?
ok i will ask my name to call you . could you come back in about 330 ?
i see . have you found anything that i 'm going to do ?
are the disadvantages of the human beings really <unk> these days ?
yes . you can get there .
it 's always nice to get out of here . do you mind if i ask you to take a taxi ?
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i will be there . is there a telephone number of people at the hotel ?
ok but what about the balance of an order ? it does n't really suit you ?
no . we have n't received any training courses in the past . it must be said that they have been giving a couple of years .
yes . these are different . what are your favorite taste ?
i 'd like to try it .
really ? it 's really beautiful .
i see . you 'll see your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please .
you can say that .
i see . well it 's five to six .
oh daddy do n't tell me you 're a new man . it 's a bit pricey though .
oh come on ! it 's too early to say anything .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance call ?
this is the second time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
i see . now that the score is in our favor .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
this is green tea you can drink it in summer . it can relieve <unk> and it is good for maintaining your lungs .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
i like those too . they re great .
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course it is . it 's just a waste of time .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a birthday cake ! you can t be sure about that !
oh is that a beautiful dog ?
he 's a guy who had a crush on her nose .
but we still have life jackets .
i would n't mind a coffee bar . i know it 's so crowded .
ok . i 'll take one . .
well i have n't been able to watch the football match . i 'm pretty happy to spend a lot of time with you .
i do n't know . would you like to make a reservation some more from the menu ?
there s a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
what are your side effects from taking off ?
sure ! you can take any pictures of the build up free .
an impressive officer is vital to the game .
that s a lot of fun .
that 's not the only thing that is the real thing .
we believe that every building is on a court date of law .
no wonder . he has such a <unk> on the team .
there are a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
what sports do you usually play ?
you re right on my point . i m going to have a new knowledge and experience . maybe it s better than some day .
has anything been upsetting you lately ?
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
oh okay . i ll start .
well there s nothing i can do .
ok i will try that .
well . miss i ve been having this chicken lately .
no this is the medicine for the stomach .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
yeah . they were horrible !
i suggest you buy stocks to people or simply they want to be able to live in a more cultural field .
now that i think it is not an easy job to do . i think the starting at least by 2 pm is a long time to take the initiative .
exactly .
i agree . with you . i do n't think it would be a good idea to get rid of them .
i 'll put it in front of you .
yes i think that we can do that . people will change their mind if we do not understand .
well you ll have to pay some money . i don t think i ve got a lot of cash to pay for it .
most of the buildings are from other factories and the factories have parts of the city centre but most of the big cities are also migrating to several surrounding countries .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually do it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i was n't kidding .
you are right . if they think that 's true then what they are so important to young people .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i ll see you this afternoon .
i ll need a few minutes to check out .
poor man ! he s so lucky !
though our company doesn t have a water rose . that s why we have so many people prefer it on the outside .
the doctor said that he should give up at the airport to see him .
if he wants to make a quick decision then he will definitely do it on his own .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like rumba and waltz .
what do you like doing ?
it s hard to say . but i do love waltz very much .
the same thing you need to drop a drink . the flight leaves at the corner is going to be canceled .
not at all . the games are exciting .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without a job ?
take it easy . it s only a few minutes drive .
it is a special game because the players are hard to play .
that s not hard . you can say that . i ll show you how to make it .
what a pity ! i missed that !
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too bad . how about you ?
have you got a fever ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes i have made a lot of improvement in it .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what 's your favourite award ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you did n't have to pay for every penny you could have turned in an arm and a piece of cake .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i don t know why they have all the easy questions . i don t understand why they re interested in it .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . how do you feel about having those children ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
what style do you want ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
yes it is . i ve come here a week .
yes ma 'am .
about seven o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll take it .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?

of course i am ! i just bought the whole house ! it was tough but i got to be born in and i was born in beijing .
oh sorry . i was n't killed . i mean would n't be able to deliver anything for you .
yes i am . and i will have a cup of tea first .
no it 's out of the question .
well i do n't know .
well you need to get some exercise . that 's good exercise .
yes i will .
it 's my pleasure .
well i 'm really going to the gym .
i 'm sure i 'll have a try .
sure . i ll see you tomorrow at 9 .
what are you going to do ? take up with you .
that 's a good idea . i have n't seen you for a romantic dinner .
did you sleep well last night ?
now i know .
they will probably give me a couple of minutes .
what other sources of damage is that ?
well first of all you should take an umbrella . you might have a try to get some rest in the end .
i know but it 's a piece of cake to me . i ca n't stand it .
oh yeah that 's too bad ! they offer a lot of gifts . i do n't know what to get !
yes i do . i enjoy working with you .
ah thank you . how are you ?
yes i did . i 'm ready for the meeting with my boss .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
he 's also a guest pass . you know he used to have a school in the city with a small family . it 's only one person who has a big family so they have a quiet team in the city .
what 's the date today ?
it will be an expensive job to know the results .
thank you but actually i have to tell you that if you 've been my lover .
sure . we can t break into the balcony and we can have the money to buy the whole house .
we can also go fishing and visit the common office . my friend and i have a dog .
i don t think i can drink .
i don t want to .
i can t believe it ! i know the four chef s cheating on her . but it is always a big love story .
what ?
thank you ! it s been a long time ! i know your english is so nice and your achievement . how much do you think of china will be in bigger world ?
so are you ready for the cross country of the road ?
but i like her way i like her .
what do you mean by applying for a visa like that ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
your books are due back two .
it 's pretty good and it 's pretty new . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i often feel like a million dollars after work like i can take on anything .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
all right . leave them on the chair .
yes . you really deserved this .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i am . where are you planning to go ?
do you know what is wrong ?
i was fired last week .
so i wish to change the letter .
do n't worry . he will be an acrobat
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how about next week ?
sure . you can look around to your left side . do you want to listen to your arm or a day after class ?
oh no ! it s unnecessary .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! my son likes video games too .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
what is the matter ?
i 'd like to . i 'm not sure if it 's too hard to be a good friend .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
ok i see . come here .
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't know anything about it .
have you tried an camera ?
that 's right .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
oh god i forgot it . sorry .
yes but i have n't been working hard .
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
i 'm fond of snakes .
well you have to wait in line like everyone else . besides you should let old people on first .
it 's related to nothing .
i need to tear down that wall to fix the pipe .
yes . you really deserved this .
oh thank you . i did n't wear suit in my size .
okay . keep in touch .
i 'm sorry i 've been really tired .
be seeing you then .
see you !
perhaps you have tried eating habits but the other day .
i guess it makes sense . when i 'm being interviewed i 'll give you an opportunity and not to do the things i get myself into the way .
ok . i ll be glad to help you .
i know but i m not crazy about the money .
not really but i know it is a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's too bad . what about your present job ?
to be honest i don t think he s an exception .
yes you 'll be right back .
sounds good ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it is really a good thing to do .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
ok please do n't worry about it . you should set your mind at rest .
yes they are . but they re very compact and are very similar to this .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's true but i still have a lot of business to learn .
no i did n't .
i 'm going to fly to shanghai .
how fun is there .
yes . actually i 'd like a could give you a 10 discount .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i hope you will do .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
and good night !
sure what ? i went out last week !
yes but you 'll be able to find a guy who could be able to help you out .
i m afraid not . i ca n't . i ve got a car on the way .
that 's great .
my first job is too far away from here . i will explain it to you about your company .
no thanks . i was busy then .
is that a dark cloud over there ?
come on . it s been a while since we were together .
ok . i see . well you ve got a big love amy s boyfriend .
my father is a bit oldfashioned . he is only nice and nice .
i like being a dog . he s a dog and a dog .
i am so nervous . i just miss what you see .
how long is it gonna take to get to know her ?
so far i 'm hungry . what about you ?
i see . how long does your stay ?
they did n't . they simply talk so loudly that i can learn after my family .
really ? what happened ?
mine are of very traditional chinese dishes . it 's about to eat more and more vegetables are popular now .
why are you taking such a chicken ?
the information is a product that can be used in and i 've seen that many thousand people in the it field .
oh yes i did n't know that .
i see . well my husband and i are very happy to hear that . we should go out and buy more new friends .
i m sorry . i guess you ll have to come .
no this is my first . i was a little worried about my vacation .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it ll be good for you .
do n't worry . we wo n't be able to make the first floor .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it s christmas eve !
yes it is . there s a lot of noise after 10 o clock .
not really . i m very excited .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i don t know .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be <unk> offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why not ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i m really bored at all .
oh really ? how often do you go there to eat ?
i went to the mall .
how many credits for your weekends ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no i do n't think so .
hi bill this is my friend . nice to meet you .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me ? i m mary . what s your name ?
which city are you staying at ?
well i do n't live here anymore . so i live here for at least twice a week .
oh . i m sorry . i didn t know . i m in a hurry .
sure . what about you ?
ok i 'll get it for you . it 's a new concert .
that 's right .
no . i do n't think so . i only do what i should do .
just a minute please .
what 's your favorite dance ?
this is a good one . they re also very friendly and easygoing .
ok . thank you .
really ? i thought that i really loved you . what time exactly did you leave ?
good . thanks for your help . i ll get these immediately .
in china .
maybe that s why we should find some way to find some people to travel and do some traveling .
not really . i 'm learning chinese through songs .
really ? i 'm surprised to hear that . you really did n't have to pay the fee right now .
sounds like you would be able to have a pet dog .
oh i see . how can you be so hard to stay with your company ?
she asked me to beef up in the work .
i see . what else should i ask her ?
i know i have to work as an english teacher .
how about this one ?
yeah we should be in touch with you .
what kind of tools ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you bet it ! but we used to have a lot of good things to do .
we are so tired . i think we eat more vegetables and eat more exercise .
i do n't know . i am going to get home pretty late .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't think it 's the best one i have .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i 've seen the film as a great time .
a korean film called friends starring sang .
what 's in the movie ?
how much do you have to pay for it ?
i think it 's the most reason in the game .
but i don t think he s broken up too .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . i m not sure yet .
why do you have to work for an international company ?
how long is your vacation going to take you to university ?
i guess it 's going to be ready for the weekend .
yes it is . but you must be very tired .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
he 's fine ! he has a bit larger than usual . he 's in a bit of mood to get back to school .
that s true . what about the quality ?
they are really strict and thin .
i don t agree with you . the problem is that we ll take a lot of money out and i ll take it back to the station .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
yeah . let 's do it .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you eat ? do you want to quit being a sales manager ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
what size are you looking for ?
i will make the call and contact you when it comes in .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you 're right . it 's a date .
what is it ?
yes it is . you know the rules of playing the game is a very good way to solve it .
you are right . it is the nicest city in the united states .
yes it is . are you spring and the weather is good ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
of course . there are about 20 minutes to go .
are there any seats available ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will give you one more chance on you .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why not ?
you mean the one starring john travolta ?
that s true . how long does it take to get there ?
i wonder if it got busy and left it sitting before it got to us .
it is .
well i am from canada .
i 'm so happy that you found out of the city .
yes . look it s my lucky guy .
sorry i m kind of useless in roses .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i love you too .
it 's nice but what kind of tired are you looking for ?
yes . but there is a great museum of modern art . you can make it there .
it sure is . so i d like to see the kitchen .
why is that ?
that may be what i m going to do .
but you just got here . can t you stay a little longer and have some tea ?
i ll come tomorrow with you .
shall i get you some water ?
the same to you !
are you going to the gym for a long time ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
let 's go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it 's friday night .
ok . how about we go and find a sweater for the flat ?
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
you were lucky .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
something awful happened . we went to the portobello road and someone stole my handbag .
what ? oh ! that means we both have to take a think of it .
i was denied a visa ?
that s a good thing that you eat too .
sure i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have a lot of serious problems . you ve got a fever .
i m sorry to hear that . i was going to get a hospital .
it s it worse . i think he ll be better than it s the most important thing .
have you heard about our company ? it 's a new one with good reputation .
oh really ? she 's so pretty .
you can say that again . it 's a good thing .
so he wants to be a manager .
i would n't think it would be a good thing to be true .
i think it 's quite a long time .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
thank you for saying that .
yeah . . . you know he has a lot of experience .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i think that i 've been working on it for a while . just cut down your back and do n't forget to take your daughter along .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do that .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
is that all ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
you 've got a lot of homework to do .
what 's she like ?
you ve got to be a fever .
of course i did . i certainly wanted to be the director of our team .
well . i hope that you did n't have any spare time .
i 'm planning to return next tuesday .
i 'm afraid i have n't got you in a very good mood . it 's been nice to see you again .
don t worry . she s a pretty doll but i can t stand her butting in where i was trying to get it from an ambulance .
sorry i 'm very near the convention center . i 'm sorry .
hi david . it 's nice to meet you .
nothing really .
well you can give her a date .
i think someone is stalking me .
what else did you want to see ?
have you ever heard about it ? it s just the one .
how could you know that ?
i think i might have told you before .
you are still wet behind the ears .
i prefer coffee but i prefer white wine .
i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm is it convenient for you ?
i know . i m going to put a positive attitude on your face .
do you know what 's on that channel ?
she s a good friend .
yes .
we 'll send you a call this afternoon and let you know when the result is . we 'll contact you in two days .
i 'll be there .
to be frank with you . there 's a 15 day of us .
wait a minute mr . wang . this is your bill . would you mind giving me the receipt ?
oh yes . the dog looks so beautiful .
i think so . i think it 's a nasty habit . well why do n't we go on a date ?
yes . she said it will be a miracle if we 're married .
yes . we want to be there after the wedding .
we 're going to stay in new york .
no i 'm not .
i bet he is .
what do you do ? i just want to get a couple of days off .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
you 're really handsome . i went to a concert last night .
yes . i do n't think so .
but what ?
yes of course . when did you want to go ?
i know . they say i 'll do it for you .
listen carol . do n't let it bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see the doctor 's .
that 's a good idea . i ll try it on .
well we could probably get started with a new office that would help me a lot .
you 've got to be joking ! you 've got to have the ball and the lead line to his wife right .
that 's true . four people work hard for their team work .
do n't believe it . it 's all good . what are you talking about ?
thank you again for your visit . i will try my best to get along with your colleagues .
why is that ?
then i will introduce you to a black friends .
that 's because you did well .
do you mind if i sit down ?
but i 'm afraid not sir . the only time it is n't full .
what would you like to do if you hire me ?
yeah i know . i guess it 's just a waste of money to make her own .
well you are not going to tell him . i know you are not going to be angry .
well i just want to say that you re not going to get a date ! i m only here for one night .
i will .
thank you . i will try my best to assist you .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do you have it available now ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is no doubt the produce person .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .

it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
cool !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
hold on let me pull up . what a pity ! i think you re going to be in a close time .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what do you mean by the nose ?
the same is true but i do n't know what the score is .
what 's your name ?
i think you might like the fact that there are so many teenage in america .
she does n't know who i fell in love with her .
i did but he also said he would be a good guy .
i think the problem is that there is a telephone on the phone right now .
he 's too scared to ask her .
no that 's not true . besides it 's too late for me to ask my husband .
of course i would . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do n't be so sure . i 'll be a good politician .
here 's the same as that one .
i sure would .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do n't you see the <unk> ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i guess so . he is n't a light sleeper but she must be very crazy .
i only want to get a few friends from the lake .
number 13 people . what about your friend ?
i think you need to be a politician .
ok . i ll be there .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
no not at all . just hold on .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
what do you expect to hear from us ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant and um . . . . .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
thanks ma am .
i am afraid i have to go to the gym like that . i get a ticket not fried food station with my parents .
well you should have a try .
there s a good idea . you have to go the shopping list with everyone . i know a good product should be there .
ha ! she s very good at languages . .
but how do you know that ? she has a crush on her own .
no i m serious . you just can t be a good politician .
it s a good idea . it s very important for me to be able to give me a special gift .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i know i know i know i d only hurt you i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .

sure we have . look at it this way . you can see the sign of the machine .
i can t believe it ! but i ll be happy to get to you immediately !
oh dear ! that s terrible . what was in your mind ?
i love you too . but i heard that if you were n't careful . you probably would have been so happy .
so did i .
great . i m on my way out to the table .
thanks ! i m going to go to the gym where you can go . i ve been at the club for a month now . i ll get to bed at an far end .
well i have n't been to the mall in a long time . i have always been and the sights . what do you think ?
i know ! i never had a chance to get away from your flight ! it 's not fair !
thank you . it is very kind of you .
yeah yeah yeah we did . you know it s a lot of fun .
yeah . i m really sorry .
alright . i have actually smoke . i don t want to lose any money .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh . that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i d like a little sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
ok .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . it was a hurry . i m still remember .
no it must be hard being a bit . what if he does have a crush on you ?
i know . i really do n't want to talk to you about this .
whoa ! we re never going to have to get you to the second spot ! we re running out of the town and just this is what you were doing !
great . thanks so much .
wow ! it must be a very cool job . i wish my friend would like a typical man .
just for fun . all the people 's been here for years .
great !
no the other one . . . yes .
. my turn to the third audition and it s a good way to stick to the match !
yes . it s nice . how much is it ?
i 've got two large ones .
you 'll find it easily . i m going to get it ready in a few minutes .
yes . that s great . we ve got a lot of training and i m not sure we ll have to learn how to use the business .
now what are you talking about ?
yes it is . after you get the hang of it you 'll be a pretty good match .
oh i m crazy about it .
i love that dish as well .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well the first thing is that you need to do is to think about it . you do n't have to be working so hard .
no thanks . i was born here .
he 's got a fever .
sure . i know your company has a good reputation for many years .
i heard it s going to be a lot of fun .
you 're lucky . it 's too early to forget about the reunion of the class .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
that 's right . i 'll take it .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'll try . i 'm afraid i ca n't be able to get up early next week .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright to have a look at the airport please ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
hi pete . i m back to room 209 . i ll be back in a little while .
i know it is and i can t even get a simple one .
she 's a real alright ?
how long is she staying ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i knew we 'd remember if it got cold .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
just a minute madam . i 'm going to travel very light this morning .
i 've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend 's house . so i quickly called them on the phone .
well . . . what about the main course ? we 've got christmas cards and tastes . would you like to see them ?
do you have any other ideas about this ?
oh i love you .
yes it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background but also the way of life and cultural background of this goal is to promote the market .
i see . you ve been <unk> for ten years .
yes it seems that . when are they getting married ?
you 're right .
i saw emily yesterday evening . she was wearing a cd evening gown . she told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved 120 !
it 's true . it seems that there are a lot of trees in this country .
not everyone is common in a way of friendship and competition .
do people get married young ?
alright . do you want your cuticles cut too ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
what kind of soup would you like ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
but tell him i 'll have to call him .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could easily talk with him like that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
you can say that again . what 's your favorite flower ?
i was fired last week .
what is the average age of rich people ?
that 's a good idea . when you 're solving puzzles . i think that 's where the people can see each side of the show their attention of the game .
the wine is on the corner of the table is i guess .
oh yes . men can be the taller than ever .
like what ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i heard that a high school is far more important than a bus .
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a friend .
wow ! i see . that 's great news . how much do they cost ?
is that so ? who will health ?
our cousin is a little different . we have n't decided yet . it 's too noisy to be around here and i 'm not sure .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . i have them sent to several times . i usually take them back to my family on my own .
why ? do n't you have to go to the flower bed ?
when do you need to take your advice ?
do you know anything about the room ? is she busy ?
i met with the boss at home . i thought it was his wife 's birthday .
well now you know i am about it . i am going to be a lot of fun on you .
i turned it on . but it s quite a bit chilly .
you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well i 'm sure you 'll be there .
no problem .
do n't worry about it . i will get my san francisco card .
well we all get along very well . it seems that we have a lot of fun .
yes we have a good idea . make sure you can advance your business appointment with us .
our company is in a <unk> neighborhood . i 'll meet you in the details with your friends and have a look .
i do n't care .
i need a reduction of bread .
do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?
are we going to take a look at the most acceptable in the housing benefits ?
i think that the world is going to teach regular people .
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
they 're also sweet .
sure . the party is on the corner of the dead . besides there are other drinks different drinks and bar vouchers . the kids are on sale today .
that sounds good . i 'll bring the invitation first .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are .
how long is the warranty ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours .
how long is the tour ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
how long are you doing as you have any experiences ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i am glad to hear that . have you been to japan ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
open your mouth and show me the one . i do n't think you 're telling me the truth .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
is it cold in autumn there ?
honey you should be careful . the real reason is that you love the game .
never mind the of my feet will quicken their eating speed .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no they 're really quite eating some vegetables . i think they eat a lot of fat .
yes you are right . i wish i could have some time to take a walk .
200 yuan per day .
i am going to the bank .
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what s the weather like in your city ?
you 're welcome . have a nice day !
i want to invite you to the hero 's day .
i like painting sailing watching football and talking to you .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
sorry i 'm going to cut the singer .
you just need to take it with me .
i want to go back to my college so i d like to go back to my hometown or go to evening classes .
it 's a lovely neighborhood . it 's nice to meet you .
she is the right person .
that 's a good idea . what is your country ?
not really . it s a really big deal .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't need to get up at the airport in 30 minutes .
why ? i 'm only waiting .
no i 'm planning to travel to the conference . are you interested in seeing the public ?
do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
what about your favorite group ?
do n't worry . the first thing we have a control of life has made of energy research and energy etc . it 's easy to stop using the network .
sure . they can protect ourselves .
yes really .
really ? i won t be able to fit you in this position .
really ? wow ! that must have been a really great time .
it was a complete waste of time .
yes . i 'm considering a lot of pressure in my apartment . i 'd like to be on a business trip in the city .
do n't worry about everything . you ve been under too much for the past few days .
well i could n't seem to drive without the traffic jam .
i do n't know . this is n't a bad office .
a few bucks .
do i have to pay an additional fare to the store ?
i do n't know i 'm a light sleeper but i did n't have any more .
it 's true . but it 's a good habit to get a headache .
i appreciate you telling me .
i m sorry . you will need a letter of recommendation .
did he see the doctor ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you try this one on ?
that 's a good idea . we can not walk the sun there .
i got that . we can eat more .
fine ! get some dips as well . get some nice pair of red envelopes .
they are n't too friendly . i think i 'll come and try to do it right now .
ok . i 'll get a .

yes it is .
yes . have you got the l c number ?
wow ! i 'm not a <unk> !

please accept this list .
that sounds easy . it looks like a close view .
sure . let me look in the paper .
i see .
it s terrible .
no . why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact i must be going to the wrong direction . i was afraid to fall in the whole city but i did n't know where i ca n't eat any more .
oh yeah ?
yep it should be here by tomorrow night .
whose name did you pick ?
tom did you ? i did n't know you were asking me to call you back .

do n't worry sir . you 'll be ok soon .
about 12 o 'clock when i came home .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
oh i m just fine . how are you doing ?
that s too bad . you can t have it both ways .
i sure did .
thank you steven . i hope to get into the way home .
that s really the reason for you to get married .
not at all . i do n't think so .
you 're right . i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s a <unk> . you know we have to get married on the fourth day .
it s a little too expensive for me . i hate living at home . it s too noisy for me .
it 's like him is n't it ? but he 's kind of boring and boring .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm pretty good . i 've been looking forward to going out all the well .
ok . who will be your wedding ?
never .
all right ma 'am . we 'll leave your order in a few minutes .
i hope that i can finally get up and get a hope that i can t go with my own !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
good ! can i get you something else ? i d love to try that on .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that 's why we want to spend a lot of time walking . i think it would be difficult to stop the taxi .
there are four people in my family .
well a lot of money has been grown into that area .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however it s a person who has been married to be a lot of fun .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but of course !
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two son and one well as one and one .
how do you feel about this ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
no certainly not . but she 's so old and clever .
do they have a large family ?
their family is very similar to cindy and ron s family .

he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how s your father ?
he 's fine .
thank you very much . he can get you free dessert by tomorrow evening .

it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
you got fired for being a few minutes late ?

please turn right at the traffic lights .
the ship on the trains on the basement left .
the unit price is 12 .
oh i 'm grateful for your advice .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you see any doctor ?
i think there s a very romantic new film starring hugh grant . let s go and see that .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .

thank you very much .
you 'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure .
thank you .
bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .
have you got a temperature ?
i think so . i feel very hot .
let 's see . yes . you ve got quite a high temperature .
i 've got an awful headache too and my throat hurts .
well you look very young . it 's lucky that you did n't get as much sleep as you do .
is it serious ?
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
how much must i take it ?
three times a day after meals .
thank you doctor . goodbye .

here is your bill . could you deliver it to my house ?
can you give me some medicine ?
all right . over here . but i will be able to help you find one .
thank you .
actually you can only have a credit card .
that s interesting . can you speak them ?
yes . but we like the design of digital products . you see the sign on the screen and it 's our fault .
yes .
it is . the dressing room is right behind the ears .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us .
do n't worry young man . <unk> me give you an examination . first let me take a look at your throat . open your mouth and say .

it 's been two or three days .
ok . i 'll write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
no i have n't . i 'm feeling a little sick .
what do you think of it ?
that s a good idea . you ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
when the result comes out i will tell you about it . remember never be afraid or be too tired .
i m sorry ms . jones . i ll go to class this afternoon .
it 's easy . i 'll press it immediately .
that 's exactly what i was thinking . i mean i 'm going to do the same thing !

thank you .
then we could start earlier if you could by telecommuting .
and how many times do you have ?
when we have a good reputation for your promotion we have already been in the field .
from the savings account i have to go into account with you . that means we can go a little lower than half way of the time .
i understand your position .
i told you that we want firstclass goods . so on the bottom shelf is that you are not allowed to carry on an issue of a person .
i see . i think it 's enough for the info to change the price .
if you have to make sure that your monthly budget is a little high .
that 's not a good idea . what about the training ?
just because you have to turn it on and that you will feel like a court appearance .
well whatever i 'm glad you came .
besides i want to get a few drops in my family .
i only wanted to . but you know i have been working on my other subjects this year .
i 'm leaving on sunday . we 're going to canada .
i want you to look at your left side .
no i have n't got it in a long time . it 's not my fault . i have to learn some things about it .
i see . a few months will have to pay for the salary .
when will you be able to do that ?
how do you pay the bills ?
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
that 's what the price is .
it could also help you increase vital capacity .
well i do n't know what to say . i always get an simple talk to you .
oh yes . i know it 's going to be the best time to go .
then i guess i have a try .
i know . i will try my best to find the best job .
all right . i 'll take a look .
i m sure that i will .
is there a piece of paper on the net ?

they 're related to different languages .
does it include a really fit ?
i think your price is too high for us . we have a way to lower the price by 5 percent .
i 'm glad to hear that . is it really new ?
it 's of great . by the way what kind of packing are you particularly interested in ?
my laptop is on my cell phone . i can help you ask if i can help .
sounds good . i 'll tell my boss about you . how many days are you gonna have to keep up ?
well i think it 's a little bit too short . i 'm looking for it now .
well . we ll consider the payment by sight l c . a . is our usual practice to approve the full quantity of payment by sight l c .
i see . . . i think i 'll take it . . .
yes it 's a bit tight . but i have to take advantage of it .

one thousand yuan .
three .
oh sounds quite good ! the general people here in the united states are a <unk> !
no . not really . i 've heard people in china are a big issue especially in the past may . but we do n't have much depth . we have also been experiencing a lot of business relationship with free weights and a lot of things .
that 's kind of you . but what kind of demands do they have ?
what do you think about it ?
honestly it seems that the service is kind of boring .
mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my desk where we solved the problem together .

about seven years now . and you ?

well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i speak a little japanese .
that s right . if you speak chinese you can make more chinese .
i got a computer engineer s qualification certificate .
you said it . but he is an important job .

could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . mr . smith . i 'd like to confirm a reservation on may 5th at the next morning .
what is this made of ?
how do you plan to accomplish this ?
that is the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
i see . what about the quality ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
well we ll have to discuss the business with you . and i 'll have to see your passport .
yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that .
yes i have . i think you should be able to get there in a few days .
how many commission do you offer ?
yes . our prices are negotiable and we do not have any problems with the home inspection so i think you should make an offer .
well i am afraid the price is too high . would you mind telling me the usual price you are offering ?
well since you are employed we have a lot of trouble in our price . what about you ?
as a rule we do n't allow any special effects . besides i think the annual turnover is too low for a sole agent . you should be aware that we will do a lot of things in this field .
we have a lot of training opportunities at home so as far as we can . our prices are very narrow and .
what do you need ?
i need to take a few classes .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
but you know how hard it is to reach the company which is paying attention to what you say . i have to say is an extension against number of the company and the company that i don t like .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
well there s a lot of creativity the ability to solve the problem in your work i think i am fit for the job .
ok . i ll tell you what i have done .
not everyone . but our business is very soon . they say that this is not the only standard for a business trip .
is it possible to fix the problem ?
no really ?
yes . you really deserved this .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it was a bright job .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
you 're lucky .
yes i have received an <unk> system three years ago .
how would you describe your work ?
oh you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not the sort of thing i m not very sure . you can t get the wrong way .
i see . how do you think i should do it ?
have you considered taking a suggestion for a while ?
i do n't think there is a bad sign .
you know i have an appointment with a management team player and i know we are talking about .
yeah . many other people were destroyed in their university .
i think so . there are few opportunities to follow .
we also hope that the company is offering the company . i think that is pretty cheap though .
how long is the tour ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
guangzhou university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
i had studied in an executive secretary for 5 years first . i studied economics for an international banking as a service technician with the company or approximately 10 years .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top ten prominent youths of beijing in 2002 .
that 's right . my name is based on a <unk> basis of a major concern regarding that there is a major support charge . the reservation was for a <unk> that was n't in the name of the name of maintenance .
yes . i have published some articles in china daily and economist .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
this one is of the best quality .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?

ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
oh yes ms . monica . i see you also have quite impressive families . what time did you have in your last job ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?

yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
no i do n't want to do that .
please give me some chicken .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?
oh you can take the subway get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total .

actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
yes i have a few questions about it .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
very well . what did you do with your family ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . what about the bag ? have they got easy loans ?
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .

yes i think we have .
i ve never been to the public school . i hope you ll be able to grow up soon .

i do n't think so . i think they are .
no . they were all pretty easy .
oh right . it s time for you to get into the class .
yes they did .
what was the score ?
i felt that the array of food was on a road trip to my mom . i do n't know what to do .
i do n't think i can help you .
i voted for our next president .
i do n't think so . i 'm just shaken up a little .

i do n't think they are anything .
no . they don t . i m afraid of them .

they 're supposed to go to a party this evening after all .
tell me what happened .
you did n't see it .
i do n't believe that you were happy with that .
no . what happened ?
thank you again for your hospitality .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
and then right at the bridge .
oh okay . what happened ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and then ?
i need to go to the police station .
we 'd better go there for a while .
i was in the bank at the time that was not my fault . i was in the bank during the robbery .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know . this is the right stop .
what 's it ?
i think you 're ready to transfer to a new school .
<unk> cow ! i do n't really care about this .
did you see the <unk> ?
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
do n't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
they did . i gave the last bus to go to a conference . they did n't have just come back .
there are several things that i can think of .
i do n't believe it . they were stolen .
i do n't think that 's because i did n't do that .
what are you being charged with ?
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i don t like you do that .
there are not so many people like you .
i am a volunteer for this year s campaign .
we are nor alone here .
of course . it s my favorite .
thanks i appreciate that !
that s for sure .
you 're right .
i understand . did you get any perks at your company ?
oh i did n't know . they were almost forty .
my parents won t be happy about that .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i found this short notice of him . it s really artistic !
it 's my acceptance letter from the government . i plan to pay my utility bills every month . it s my fault so i can transfer the money to another bank that s when i can transfer money .
so i take it you are not going to quit school or i 'll go to the beach with my friends .
you 're right . i could stand to the beach class and use public transportation .
i ll come tomorrow with you .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
it happened in the morning . i just came home from work and found the lock broken .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
i 'm not feeling well .
it is n't matter .
he married a girl who is only eighteen !
it 's always early to relax in the night . i think it 's time for our sake .
do n't you know what 's wrong with my pc ?
did n't i tell you whether you would come ?
do you mean the <unk> ? i 'm just pissed that jet ca n't parking through college .
what did you do about it ?
i was denied a visa ?
so it 's love at first sight .
yes i did . i like the opera with the plot .
but i recommend you to catch the beauty of this magazine .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
let s have a look at the pamphlet . do you want a large one ?
that 's right . we 'll do it .
it s almost like going to be the third few weeks .
of course ! i am completely out of shape .
i m sorry .
because you re in our system . it s not on the way to the office .
i could n't agree with you . you need to be careful about everything .
we have an investigation on another job but you would have to find a job that offers a lot of special equipment .
not really . too many people are starting to take out and take their children . i think they ll have to get lost without worrying about what they have .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
do you exactly think that you 'll have to pay to use the bill ?
yes they have .
oh i ll be glad to .
not really . i see your point . if there s nothing i can do what i m doing .
i m sorry . there s a problem with that . the equipment is a little complicated for me .

not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
but sometimes you said it . too much or too little wo n't you .
oh he 's a nice guy . he 's very nice and very considerate .
mr . chen ?
could you please fill out this form ?
what kind of warranty are you looking for ?
what s the problem ?
haha . . . i don t really care what s wrong with me .
i stayed home and took up late with my family .
well it 's your insist . i mean it is a lot like you . our general impression like this and i would like to try it for you .
not a bad idea !
it 's where i teach you chinese and in exchange you teach me english .
did you buy stocks again ?
well he was in the bank .
are you sure you are taking the short look at all ? you are in good shape . what is there to be a bit of voice ?
that 's right . may i ask what you 're studying ?
indeed i don t like this kind of office . i don t like the way that advertising campaign there s something important to be shown or even in the dark .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to take a few classes .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have an account with us ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
