sure . people can enjoy to cut out after little .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it 's all your fault .
why not ?

i 'm very sorry .
i don t know . i m a terrible dancer .
i used to play football regularly when i was at university . and i used to do athletics in the summer .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .

what do you think is the relationship between the food and the food ?
how do you think i should get some jeans ?
of course . it 's really worth visiting .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m afraid not . it s broken .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you ?
i bought this sheet here yesterday .
i 'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
i am in the middle seat .
what education background do you have ?

i guess i should .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .

i 'm not sure .
that 's fine .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . it was my pleasure .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
i do n't know . it will just work .
i guess you are right .
i do n't know . maybe you should do something . maybe you could do some shopping .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing to go to the party they should be there . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
how about going to join us ?
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . but there is something wrong with this car .
i hate you to fix it . what is it ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .

i know but i do n't know how to write it .
yes .
and do you know the proper courses ?

let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
jog ?
then you should go to the park more minutes in the afternoon .
i hate to go to work .

that sounds attractive all right .
we 'll try our best .

i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top .
um . . . yeah ! i bought it this morning . . .
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon .

i 've never had one of those before .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were in the sun all day .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .

it doesn t matter . i guess i ll take it .
ok . now i 'll have it registered then .
what do you think of the new teacher ?

we are new in this area .
can you describe a mango to me ?

i see . well you have to fill in this form and let me know when you 're finished .
that sounds great ! how long does it take ?
first of all we change the motor oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
i know . i don t mind eating peas and carrots buy i hate to have no time at all .

i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that would be great .
will there be any layovers ?
yes what kind of apartment are you interested in ?
that sounds fantastic ! i like it but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem sir . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it 's wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment .
i see . we have many floor but how much are you thinking of going to spend ?
do you think it will work out well ?
not at all . it 's just the right time .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll go to the gym right away .
yes i d like to book a room .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time will he be back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
see you later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
that s good to hear .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge is convenient .
what is the rent ?
i think it 's too expensive to live in a home with two people .
it 's a little bit expensive .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
yes i know that . it is crucial to have the price . but i am worried that this is the same .
i do n't know . i hate it . it 's just that it is n't a pleasant sight especially if i make an exception .
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
do you have any hobbies ?
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
in the market .
i do n't know . but i am so upset . maybe he will come to the movies .
i do n't know . i think we can make a good impression on him . we are always willing to work with him .
but i have no idea what he will do . he s really having a hard time finding a class .
no i 'll try to speak to him .
that 's a good idea . why have you ask ?
i do n't know . i think it 's boring .
hello brian ! this is jill . i 'd like to speak to linda .
wow what happened ?
i 'm terribly sorry . i 've been having trouble with getting back to work .
i m in a bad mood today .
i 've been working too .

thank you .
no problem .

i have been two years of work at the beginning of next month .
i see . thank you .
i like my hair and it 's a bit difficult to work with .
what if she was a psycho husband ?
no not at all . just watch the shirt .
hmm . . . i think that maybe the spirit of all these men look at him . he is a good person .
ok .
i 'm afraid i have n't got enough sleep in the whole day .
are you kidding ? i ca n't wait .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do . it s very easy .
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
how about this one ? it looks very nice .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
yeah i am going to the gym and i have to start working on my own . i 've been having a hard time sleeping lately .
the car is over there .
what s the good thing that i can t go to my computer !

no sir . there is a shop near the corner .
do you think the red one is better than the others ?
that s true . how much are you looking to spend ?
well i need a haircut .
i think that s an idea of how you can buy animals . you can buy animals for animals .
hey ! what 's that ?
i agree . those are of good movies that i think .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?

i might not be surprised .

good choice . our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
i ll also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts .
yes . all you have to do is sign up for the regular super unleaded .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh really ? i went to bed early .
no . that s all .
yes . look ! it s very beautiful .
sounds good to me .
i m glad you enjoyed your stay .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . let s think this through . first of all you cannot leave amy at the altar . not only will she be humiliated and kill you but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? second of all you are just getting cold feet . you want to marry her so cut the crap and do it down inside that you want to marry her so cut
i want to open a bank account .
what kind of flowers would you like ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
i m afraid i can t agree with you .
what is the special effects of those ?
well this is delicious ! we can t have any barbecue with the fish . i think we ll need to get the chicken feet today .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .

i m sorry . this isn t a nosmoker isn t it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ?
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but you 'd better learn to use the internet !
what is it ?
yes i can ask you to pass it .
i have no idea what you want . i just want to know if i m looking for a computer that can always look at .
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
ok . i ll show you how . i don t want to put this off of the washing machine .
what about the features of your <unk> ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
it 's the same as usual . just leave it to the bottom of the line . see what they have .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
i 'm not going to be able to see a doctor . i 'm not going to move my car .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i think i 've got some trouble .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
let me see . i think i 'll go to the river .
ok . i 'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes .
that sounds like a good idea .
oh that 's very nice of you .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
but i still get that sometimes .
i want to open a new account .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no you do n't have to pay the fee .
awesome !
i was told to put up with something valuable that i had to do .
i see . we will cancel it . don t worry . there s a problem .
how do you feel about this ?
i m sorry . it was too good to be true but i m so sorry .
i see . what is it ?
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
you can live without other animals . i think the set of wind .
i am sorry . we have sold out of those too .
can you tell me about the features of your background ?
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i don t want to get some jeans or something else .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now if i don t pay the bills i don t have any problem .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small .
oh yes . i like the apartment .
yes much better .
but i do n't like this weather .
true . i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s very expensive too .
it 's a bit expensive but it 's worth while .
maybe we could have some new furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
you bet .
it s a very good school .
it s going to cost you 300 a month .
that s way too much .
it s on sale today .
i don t know . it ll be much more expensive than here .
that s not enough .
what will you do if you don t mind ?
would you like to go to any lower prices ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i decided to come over to the company to take a look at your advice .
i m afraid not . i m very sorry .
yes i do . the work is project special . it s a little bit too high though i have to clean .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . it is too noisy for me .
but you can t do the best thing . my guests always seem to like having everything to do . i just have to put on the last few minutes .
so what 's the problem ? my refrigerator is in the fridge .
italian . i like chinese food .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah but i find these places better than others . it 's so cheap and convenient .
usually i go to bed at least three hours a day at the same time .
all right . i ll make it .
an ordinary one please .
an ordinary one ?
i don t think that s a problem . can you give me a discount ?
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
what is the qualification needed ?
yes . i can ring you up over here . it s very cheap though .
i like one with a brown one .
what size are you ?
any special style will be fine .
you ll be lucky !
after you have your own heart it should be a pleasure .
i m sorry . you have the wrong number .
i need to get a passport .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think it would be better for me to move on to any of the rent .
i 'm happy to hear that . how much is it ?
fine i 'll be expecting you .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i know where you get off the bus .
let me see . your room number is 105 . here is your key and receipt . take a seat in the back of the plane .
that 's fine .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh yes . i think it 's the right one .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
i like it here . the advantages of it is a little expensive but it is worth it .
i know . i was hoping that we could go to the shopping center . there is nothing like getting in the house .
i think you ll find the right place . there s the right one just around the corner .
i told you to clean it up earlier .
what a lovely dog !
the kitchen is in the bathroom .
i like the balcony but the is on the way to the back .
i will take it .
we have a single room and just one .
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new to me is that our customers is qualified .
oh look ! the view is wonderful !
i can t stand here anymore . i ll stop by working in a different area .
i know . i have to turn it on every now .
my god ! it 's a big car .
i love the bamboo design . what a beautiful view is that ?
let s go to the top .
well i have to think of it for a while . we have given the price of the company and it 's quite reasonable .
it s the felony charge .
i m sorry but you have to ask out .
hello this is the property manager . i 'm calling to confirm the date of the next interview . may i ask who is ?
where are you living now ?
i m going to move tomorrow .
i m going to move tomorrow .
yes i am . i 'm going to meet some friends from the city .
we will fine you .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one .
do you have any idea how many people are there in your family ?
thank you .
we still have some packages .
yes i 'd like to buy a pair of shoes .
well you have to be careful with our customers .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is .
history .
that 's interesting . can you give me some idea of the courses you completed ?
what do you think of the balance ?
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
oh it 's out of the place . do you have a subscription ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but i think you ca n't buy a credit card .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm trying to send you an email to tell you .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it now .
what 's the difference between the two places ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
i can recommend that . it s why i need a computer can teach you how to use it .
i can recommend you the computer i can read the book . it 's no problem . i 'm sure you will be familiar with our language skills .
i do n't want to know any of my friends .
i 'm sorry . but i guess i 've got some from it .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
i 'm here if you need any more help .
how about the jeans ?
no i do n't .
oh sure . i 'll be there around 10 .
yes please . i think i should wear a formal suit .
would you like to open your hair ?
i 'd like to have it in big waves .
what about this one ? it 's a very nice dress .
i think this style will go well . i 'm just not sure about this .
you are welcome . i 'll see you tomorrow .
it 's easy . you can change your condition .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no i do n't .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
thanks for saying that . but i think it is a bad idea .
i see . well here 's the receipt . please take a look at the invoice before you go .
yes she said that she would like a pet that i wanted to see a girl .
i can check for you .
okay . i 'll go home and prepare the supper .
yes . we have a position on the market .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i must have known that . i must have put it somewhere in a proper place .
how about summer ?
oh but i thought you said you wanted to leave an apartment with us .
hey ! i 'm sorry . but we just have to wait for the next half hour .
ok let s go check out the kitchen next .
ok i will take it .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
that 's great .
our computer lab is simply using the program .
yes i know . i would like to get more done .
let s hit the road .
yes you are right . i would love to have the perfect gift i have .
ok let 's go .
i think that the idea is a good idea . some people would agree to buy the house .
yes it 's out of the building .
i guess the tv is too dangerous for me .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
is it the same as the one ?
it only sounds complicated .
surely . as long as you can find the whole city can be dangerous as the city is worth reading .
ok i will send the information to you .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .

certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
yes . i 've heard about it but never has been to the american dream of it .
do you like some soup ?
it 's my pleasure .
how about your mother ?
ok .
what 's your favorite dish ?
no problem . i should know the address of the store .
we have all kinds of flowers made of coffee . would you like to have a look at the menu ?
yes i do . i need some advice on help with my latest suit . i also have a try .
oh i see . then i will ask my bank to get their approval .
no you can only do that when you write reports .

you re welcome .
oh yes . we have a few different kinds of styles .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?

they are the folk antique stores in the city .
i want to try on the new clothes .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i like the fact that they are the most expensive .

how do you spend your afternoons ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know . i tried to buy the most expensive clothes at the university but i do n't have to worry about them . they do n't have anything to worry about .
that 's the right . the remember that the reception is right over there .
i 'm glad to hear that .
the small fee is 25 cents a day .

i 'm afraid i ca n't afford that .
then i 'll come down and put it in the box .
ok . here is your receipt . please check it for you .
i do n't have an ipod .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we are not authorized to accept any business deals but we cannot accept these jobs .
okay .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 've got a deal to do more business with you .
here you are .

i like egg soup and two loads of pie .
it 's ok . the doctor will be ready soon .
yeah that 's what i am going to do .
it 's not just you are looking at the ring . it 's a bit difficult . you really should n't be so particular about it .
sure . i 'll have a beer please .
i see .
i think i would rather have no champagne .
no problem .
it 's still going to be a great barbecue .
no you are right . i just thought i was going to let you go . why do n't you let me know of a cough medicine and i 'm afraid it might be too hot .

how about your mother ?
thanks but i speak english with a strong german accent .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when it comes to how you feel .

maybe so . i think it 's why a dirty waste of money .
could you give me your receipt ?
i do n't know . i 'm a little worried .
no i do n't . i used to be a car accident .
i know . i could never agree with you .
it would be very hard work . it could be really hard .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy .
i 'm sure you 'll love your car .
how about this one ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states .
i 'm sure you will .

i bought one size up by mistake .
i know . i like it too . but i do n't like it at all . i 'm sure i 'll try it .

i think so . most students are learning chinese . some are just a little bit of a problem .
i 'm dead serious .
it 's my pleasure .
i 've already got a pair of trousers .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .

you can still look at it .
what s the difference ?
well sir bear with a lot of clients but we do have a lot of clients on it .

i 'm sure you can do well .
i 'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
here 's ten yuan . keep the change please .
well it 's hard to say . it depends on your size and how much you want it to be .
i 'm glad you told me .
i wish you luck but your cover letter was close to the job .
no . . . i think he was n't very good .
yes . i think you 'd better go .
what about beer ?
i was thinking that i might like to ask you something .
i 'm not sure which one to choose .
this one ?
sure . just a minute .
well it 's very nice of you .
yes . especially in autumn the winter when people push the plane .
would you like a shave ?
that s terrible !
i think it 's too difficult to explain .
how long will it take to get there ?
no i 'm ok . i think i should go to the english corner to prepare .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
that 's it really my turn .
they look all right to me .
if you could give me your basic background and then the starting to look at the final review .
do you have anything to declare ?
well . what about the balance of the most ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
it 's going to be a lot better than a bedroom .
i was born on high school and raised here . a . and i was able to find a little bit more difficult .
we need to get a lot of information on the company page . we also need to check some information about the city sights .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i used to be a private vehicle but i do n't know how to turn it off .
sounds good . i 'll take it .
we will visit the generally wellknown spots .
i 'm sorry mum . i wo n't keep you long .
do we get a day off from school then ?
i have ten years of experience . i have been making a decision on the internet and i 'm not sure what to do .
what if i go to the results ?
no it 's a chinese treat .
thank you .
on and off the shirt .
i see . how can i get the ticket ready ?
we 'll have to get the bill .
i 'm sorry i was too busy to hear you .
well . all you have to do is cook some white rice and some teriyaki beef .
i 've been a project for the past six months . and i 'm on a bit of a hurry now .
i want to know about the fees you ve been doing now .
do you have any experience driving a car ?
sorry sir . it 's the smallest size we have .
why do you think it s convenient to see the results from the text ?
they are all very reasonable .
i think that the most difficult thing is the beauty of the course .
yes i know . i 'm really sorry .
you must have realized that it was my first choice .
i need to make a deposit .
can i do anything else for you ?
yes i have it .
what ?
i d like to do that .
i ll just cancel your account right now .
but i m not in the mood for this .
i ll look for you shortly .
ok . . . no problem . i 'll take it .
what ?
i ll just cancel it for you .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i am sorry i thought you were angry .
it was n't too bad .
because i want to know about them .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
it seems that he 's a very good team in the field .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
i can schedule the appointment with him .
yes . but today he is a hard worker .
how about this one ?
how about this one ?
how about this one ? it 's made of pure silk .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh i see . i think i will try them .
yes it 's to my liking too .
thanks a lot .
it 's my dream .
what 's the problem ?
i m not sure . there s an interesting movie on the internet .
i agree with you but i think he s team .
i 'm going to the store would you like to come with us ?
i m not trying to watch you .
maybe i can just do what you need . but i can t get some medicine for you .
yes .
i m glad i could finally hear that .
i m sure you ve done a lot of good work . take a good rest .
do you have a lot of money ?
ah yes you 're right . how about this one ?
that s true . she says she can never accept a childless marriage . we had a fight last night .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
it s not like my mother . she s just as beautiful as you are at home .
wait a minute . what 's the next thing ?
i did n't know .
you know you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i do n't know how to use your camera .
but remind me never to go home again .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
okay that sounds great .
hey honey you 're not the only one with a little weight .
what 's your hearing ?
i do n't know .
well it ca n't be helped .
i 'll be right back .
so what are you doing ?
you are in love with all of your colleagues from our company .
what did you do ?
right here . see you then .
how can it be ?
what 's the problem ?
would you like to have a shave ?
yes it 's a bit difficult to wash .
i see . we have some fresh red roses .
what a pity !
you know that i 'm new to <unk> .
that sounds like you 're a good man .
i know . i know that she 's very tall .
of course there is .
i do n't think i 'm ready for a lecture .
what 's your job ?
i 'm a new student .
what is it ?
of course ! he 's the one who saved the life of the school for the school .
good evening .
she 's a friend of amy .
yes . let 's do that .
i like business management and i think it 's a nice person to meet some people .
oh shut up . you 're such a dog .
i feel sorry for her .
what did she tell you ?
i wanted to but i do have to go back to her office .
i ve got a business call that i really need to take .
yes just a minute . i 'll check if you 're wanted .
maybe we can just trade with someone else .
i 'll tell you what .
maybe he is just finishing the meeting .
what 's your favorite title ?
how can you believe it ?
you 're right . everything is 25 off . i 'll take it .
what would you like to see ?
what happened ?
what 's the time ?
no . what are you going to do now ?
no i do n't think so .
i do n't know . i never went to a church before .
oh yes . here it is .
how many students get the key card ?
how did he do that ?
i have n't got a report .
you 're a good player .
i 'm not sure . he 's a bit worried .
well it was a very good game . i was thinking of trying to give you some advice .
oh come on . you 're confusing me .
okay i 'll have it back for you .
i do n't know . i 'm a little worried .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . i thought you had forgotten . she was going to call you .
which one ?
it 's an excellent thing . the customer is clear and easily start with the talking . it is about a very good thing .
well the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge of the whole department . i was caught in a traffic jam . when finally got home i was totally exhausted . but i found the elevator was out of service due to the blackout .
i 'm so sorry i was so tired .
must i tell her you called ?
oh how did the finally happen ?
yes he was using a driving license .
cool ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go to the hole with that .
do n't you think they are a bit absentminded ?
oh no ! that 's fine . i guess i 'll go over to the gym to have all .
i know . i was an idiot but i mean to be late all the time .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
yes . it 's really exciting .
yes .
oh . . .
i 'm sorry .
just a minute . i need to make a list of the things that we need .
do you have a big car ?
and that 's it . you 're done .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
i am sorry to have taken care of it .
how much do you want ?
yes .
yes of course . i will .
that s really a relief . i was really excited about it .
i really do n't know .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes that 's right .
glad to hear that .
what was that you said ? last one . . ? but they were definitely standing in the wrong direction !
you know i often have to work till late at night .
i will ! i could use some good luck !
oh certainly . what can i do now ?
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
what do you think of the balance ?
yes . how much is it ?
that 's really cool . can you try that one on ?
i 'm a great student .
do you have a warranty with this ?
yeah i 'm . i 've never had a chance to get out of house and do some things .
no thanks . i 'm full .
do you have any identification ?
no thanks . we 'll have cake but no ice cream .
i 'm glad to hear that . how are you ?
good morning . what time do you want me to start ?
i think it is time for your career and i 'm willing to become a <unk> .
that 's great !
i really wanted to talk to you about that .
really ? how do you know that ?
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
i m going to live in the city .
it s true . you can t take that job .
i know but i m really upset about it . i thought i had taken it but now i m going to get used to it .
come on ! don t be silly !
you re crazy !
well i have a lot of experience in this area . i think i 'll be able to use my organizational skills in the world .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
i have to file a report at the police station .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it 's ok .
what a pity !
i m so happy for you .
ho no !
yeah . let 's just lounge around !
it 's already 10 .
we 'd better go out for a walk now .
ok . let 's hurry .
i 'm glad you like the weather . one of the big cities is the most expensive .
i do n't think so . i am also getting a present from my girlfriend .
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
this is the right size .
yes it is .
i 'm afraid you 've got an important line . can you call me back ?
it 's great ! i like it but i ca n't stand it .
what do you think ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
four and a half going on twelve !
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
i do n't know . it will just work .
i guess you are right .
i do n't know . maybe you should do something . maybe you could do some shopping .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
i see . . . we can go to a bar and sing some karaoke for the next race .
how about going to join us ?
it s a bit tight in the waist of the building . do you want to put in a few minutes ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
it 's ok .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't enjoy was the subway .
i really do n't want to go to the movies .
i am sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
you know that i have to work till late at night . i find out about it anyway .
never ?
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
i 'm afraid i do n't know how to use it .
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ?
but i like to be busy with some things .
you 're a good cook .
are you sure it will be all right ?
i 'm sorry sir .
ok ! i will begin to check my reservations .
i 'm so sorry .
i turned on my laptop and it broke !
what 's the matter ?
sure . what 's the problem ?
i want to get a package of cigarette .
no problem at all . i 'm really looking forward to seeing you .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
then you will be there in a few minutes .
i bought a house recently and they have no idea of what you 're going to do .
how would you like your steak ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
well we 've been making a few pairs of slippers for couples .
wow ! it 's just what i wanted .
thank you .
sure . i 'd love to . but i 'm not sure about it .
how many do you want ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
it 's my pleasure .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
i think you re right . there s a new dress too . it s made of silk and it was made in winter .
yes here you are .
thank you .
i d like to cash my check please .
no you can only exchange this .
oh i do n't know . the color is always dirty .
i have to file a report at the police station .
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hello . i 'd like to make a phone call to japan .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is it ?
well i 'm afraid it 's not at all what i wanted .
i 'll make sure and get my vote in .
but i 'm not going to start saving you money .
i really do n't think this is the least i can do .
that s okay .
oh how about this one ?
does it close at that time ?
i think i 'll go and get it .
how much will that cost ?
i m going to the opening match . i ve just finished the research reports .
i am sure you will find our prices are most competitive .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
ah ! i get it . don t worry about that .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . what kind of safety ?
it is free . please get a seat in the overhead bin first .
what ! how am i going to get to school or go shopping ?
i had a bad day yesterday .
i was late getting back from work .
oh yeah ? that s great ! i m glad you re here .
i hope so . i 'm really tired .
you know that i care for you . i m going to kill you .
can you put your hand where it is ?
yeah it 's really good to be true .
i think it s a great idea .
well i think it s going to be a little difficult .
do you mean you and i ?
thank you .
great ! this is a really great opportunity !
i hope we have n't meet the deadlines .
yes of course .
i am sorry . but you are the right person .
i 'm not going to be late .
so what are you gonna do ?
well i am going to spend some time with my family around the city or the country . .
what s that ?
oh no . it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
yeah and they are very easy to learn .
geez . is all this information for me ?
no this is the second time .
i think i just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um . . . well i just want to have a look . would you like me to put in a cup of tea or coffee ?
how about the sideburns ?
okay . um . . yes it s a little too heavy for me to move on .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . . .
um sure . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's nice but it 's quite cheap .
and this one ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m going to send you a ticket for this .
i m not crazy about it .
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well i would like to see you first ! did you have any other questions about your new apartment ?
i see . what do you think about this ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
it s nice too .
merry christmas to you !
just a minute . i 'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast .
well you d better sit down . how are you ?
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got it . don t you think i ll go to bed early ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget to take it down the patience .
fine . let s call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
what 's your hearing ?
i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! they are everywhere !
are you sure you have all of the same information ?
no i forgot to buy some .
it 's the 11th avenue park street .
it s a good thing that i ve ever had .
how about having a beer on the weekend ?
i know ! but you were the best ones !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i 'm sorry but you 'll be able to find another place in a comfortable neighborhood .
i am not really sure whether i can recover from it .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think the idea of a good advertising would be better for advertising . and i m afraid it s not sensible at big mess .
i think that s what i m looking for . what s more i m thinking of trying to buy a new one ?
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you are a better <unk> . i know your grandma . .
you are are quite right .
but what are you talking about ? i just ca n't agree with you .
yes .
come on ! i have been here for almost an hour ! i thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! how long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's the same as keeping it under the tree .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense of responsibility . now that we can keep things short in the hole .
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long that i have seen a low tariff for three months .
i m surprised to hear you say that . is there anything else ?
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
they may be very friendly and friendly to each other .
i love you .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
do n't get nervous and freaked out .
alright mom . can i swim now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
yeah you just need to take some exercise every day .
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of options ?
well first of all you cannot list you need to be afraid of . you cannot find out how much you want to invest .
yeah what if i told you that i should do what i m doing .
have n't been sleeping well .
oh what 's the matter ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still love this kind of noise in the street . sometimes i just cannot get up early in the morning .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal .
do you think you will continue working here even after you have enough time to learn something new there ?
what 's up ?
it s from nyu .
no not really . i was an excellent movie but i missed the piano .
i knew there were a few english movies !
you deserve credit too . i 've found it much better than my boss .
i 'm always at your service .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
thank you and have a great day .
so soon . it seems as if you just got here .
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
we 'll take you off .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
i 'm looking for the airport . can you tell me how to get there ?
nothing much . what about you ?
so what have you been up to ?
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
i 'm sorry . i was absent yesterday . i was an accident .
i think someone is stalking me .
you gotta have some better deodorant .
fine thanks . how 's your boy jack ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been working too .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they are doing well .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping .
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm getting nervous .
it 's a little bit strange . but if you are really upset it 'll be a little tougher for you .
how sweet !
well you 're right . what if she has done in a lower world ?
he came here last time .
you are kidding !
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .
do you think you are overreacting a little bit ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i do n't have health insurance .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
would you like to get a specific title ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's it ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
you 're right . i 'll make myself fat .
yeah it 's been ages !
great . thank you . and you ?
no i m fine .
what are you going to cook ?
i 'm hungry .
i do n't have enough money .
how about him ?
no it 's too far . let 's walk there .
oh i see . i will not forget it when it rains .
i do n't know what to say to your satisfaction .
do you believe that ?
i m very fond of you .
how about a dinner tonight ?
i 'd be glad to .
i 'm sorry .
mom i do n't know what to tell you .
i 'm really sorry . but i understand .
i am glad you are happy .
i 'm so happy .
thanks for helping out .
dad i have to do my homework .
it s from nyu .
do n't worry about it . we can always make a deal .
i know it 's so expensive .
i 'll be there in time .
what did you do ?
just watching tv .
i am tired . i just lost my job .
well if you 're lucky you 'll be able to clean your weight .
i will . but i 'm not sure if it 's worth it .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . .
i 'll have a nurse take some tests and a look at him .
here you are .
great . thanks for asking .
sure . it 's my pleasure .
how about some fish ?
thank you .
how much do you charge ?
it 's a good idea .
yes .
do we have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is very quiet and peaceful .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've heard that our students are currently working here for years .
i think it 's the most expensive drive .
these are interesting . they look so cheap . do you want to see them ?
yes i did . my family and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . how about you ?
it 's ok .
i do n't know . where do you live ?
i like her idea .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
oh that 's too bad . what kind of trouble ?
no joke !
i think it s great for a person who works well with .
i m sure you will like them .
oh yeah ! they are the ones that are the special .
i guess you 're right . i guess i was n't thinking that .
well i guess you will like the tv then .
you can do that . everyone interprets the girls that you are a lucky child .
haha . . . please do n't tell me you .
no i have n't . i 'm too busy !
i 'm going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i like spring .
it 's almost impossible to get the right balance . i can lend you some .
do you have any hobbies ?
what 's it like ?
thank you .
this color is becoming to you too .
it 's the circus .
come on . we are going to talk about the new year 's resolution .
i can do it right now .
a very good question . i was on the subject of the plane .
it s a very difficult game . the americans never never know anything about it . we all have to learn how to face the pieces . all in your country are going to win the sport
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes i see . here you are . you can see i am not a doctor . i also have a terrible cold .
yes .
that s good to hear . what 's the advantage of having a single heart heart of beauty ?
yes i mean it .
thanks a lot .
i do n't know what to do !

i told him that i was an idiot .
it certainly is ! it 's been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
where are you from ms . baker ?

it starts at 8 o 'clock .
fine . i 'll see you there .
i know . i 'm really hungry now .
it 's hard to say . but it depends on how far you are .
perfect . i 'll watch it .
could you give me some idea of the cabins ?
i thought you had trouble with clive .
thank you .
it 's nice but it 's too heavy for me . can you give me a manicure ?
i hope so . thank you .
is that a korea firm ?
sure . it 's actually the most of the time .
oh yes . i ve never seen such a thing . the girl and their songs are all newly renovated .
of course i have . i will make sure our share is the same .
what do you eat ?
they are the government of the entire country .
no fireworks are awesome !
yes i think so . one of the main things we should do is make the most of the year . after all the necessary holidays you must be sure to make a lot of money .
well i love them all too . it seems we have a lot of delicious snacks .
i will get to know about it .
well it 's a bit too late . we had a date for dinner last night .
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
i guess i 'm going to have to get something done like this .
i need to pay my water .
the tv station the world cup .

yes . i have a lot of information to learn .
it seems that some of my friends are all different . what a waste of money !
ok . let 's go .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so what is it about ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
thanks . now what are we going to do ?
what do you want to major in ?
thanks a lot .
it 's too bad that i could n't make it .
that happens to me .
we will refund your money right now .

yes .
i will be at court ?
i have been cooking more than a resume .
no i 'm full .
do i have to eat breakfast now ?
no problem .
just a beer please .
oh that 's terrible . i 'd hate to do that but i 'm tied up all day .
i do n't know . i have to get a hold of those before i make up my mind .
i used to be one of my best friend in college but i did n't know it .
no . i do n't think so . what does the exact time ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid .
no i did n't .
it 's really good to hear that .
yes i did .
and do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
it was nice talking to you also .
how are you finding your new boss ?
do you have any other plans this weekend ?
i think so . i think it 's a good thing for you to get along with the people .
no it 's all yours .
i was wondering what you see in the resume ?
oh yes . i 've put a lot of money in the company .
please do n't be so happy .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i like the fact that i have no idea how to use the piano .
do you mind if i speak frankly ?
yes you 're right . swimming is a good way to dance to any other dances .
that sounds like a good idea . but i 'm afraid she 's too shy .
well that 's true !
yes . in fact the recommendation letter written by the song is made up of chinese and has been set up by foreign languages .
is it the same in america ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body .
that s good . i think the idea is that the parents are pleased with their work .
in the united states the only thing left it the whole .
this is designed to be the size of success !
good idea .
yeah . i like the writer 's language too .
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's a good idea . how about that one ?
i 'll have a try .
how nice of you to dance !
i 'm glad you like it . why do n't you ask me to get an early start ?
no i do n't .
how do you like it ?
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate pop .
how about music ?
yes i like it very much .
let me give you a hand .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
sorry i do n't dance .
i guess i have to write the proposal .
i agree . i 'll bring it back to you tomorrow .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
but i think it 's a sheer waste of time .
no . i like to play tennis .
and to be honest i think it 's really a bit difficult to learn the environment .
yes . oh the music has stopped .
how about at a formal dinner ?
do you have any hobbies ?
it 's very nice .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of people here .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
well it can be helped . is there anything else you can do about ?
no sir . the prices here are free .
oh no . i see . what a coincidence . i 've never seen a lot of of of them . but i do n't think i 'm in the right direction .
i think so . i think it 's too difficult to bring a date with your friends .
what kind of information do you think ?
yes it 's really cold .
i 'm glad you told me .
that s great .
do you want me to take a look ?
it 's mild . but it 's not always pleasant .
i 'm just not feeling well .
spring .
it looks nice .
but there is a lot of to do .
i like spring too .
yes it is . are you here on business ?
oh i see . how about the weather ?
i feel the same way .
it 's an important meeting to prepare . the meeting is set up for the spring and take the next day .
yes . that s what i want .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i guess it 's the same in the uk .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
great idea !
that 's really cold .
what 's the soup of the day ?
yes the weather is so warm .
yes .
what 's it like ?
oh i forgot all of about it .
it 's very kind of you .
no problem .
i ll have to write you a ticket and <unk> your vehicle .
i 'm very glad you could come .
what 's your best price for that item ?
yes .
i 'm afraid i do n't know how to use it .
how about next monday ?
what 's the time ?
that 's fine . we ll be expecting you .
yes . i am . there are going to be a lot of people .
you 're right . we have to get up early tomorrow .
i 'd like to .
you can get one from student services .
oh are you ? how do you have to do it ?
this afternoon .
yes we have tickets for the matinee . it starts at 3p . m .
thank you .
yes it is . there are a lot of people here . we have a small car park near the park .
i love it .
yes it is . you can also check out the bulletin boards .
yeah i guess it was a pleasant experience . the government has never lived anywhere in a parent . they do n't have enough time to travel to work without food .
i do n't know how to use it .
do you have a cell phone ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
how do you think you did ?
they do . my father once used to get married in a registry office so the automobile industry .
what else is wrong with it ?
i believe it 's broken .
i do n't know .
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i do n't know . i never went to a movie in the garage before .
i know but you 're right .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
oh i see . what a pity .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you re welcome .
you re welcome .
it is so but i doubt it .
oh yes . i 've fallen a couple of times .
what 's your favorite title ?
yes he does .
would you like to talk to him ?
because i like the snow very much .
i think you look wonderful .
then i 'll try to pull it off .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm going to be able to .
i 'm sorry . we wo n't have any trouble with you .
i 'd like to very much .
i 'm afraid this is the last time .
that 's not true .
they re no all here .
do they have a large family ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york .
hi . i was really looking forward to seeing you .
it 's my pleasure .
it looks a little too wild .
i hope so . thank you for coming .
i 'm sure you will like it .
i 'm going to call you later . have a good day !
you can always be beautiful but i guess it 's just for you to be a music player .
but i want to tell her what she s interested in .
don t worry . that s just the way of my life .
you must be joking .
i can still help you pack .
i 'd love to . it 's too beautiful to be .
all right . i 'll send the colleagues to help you with that .
i know that but i find it difficult to make a good impression . i find it very difficult to bring a present work .
it 's easy . just take the subway . it 's important to remember the subway .
i think it is easy . i 'll write you a letter next time .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i ve read the book many times .
yes you re right .
i think it s great .
sure . if you are a girl you can ask her out .
could you tell me how to operate it ?
yes .
i know but i am not interested in fashion .
well i 'm not exactly the most of my time .
very interesting . so it seems you had a pretty good time for us .
no . this is the best we can do .
i think that would be a bit too small .
how about this one ?
you 'll cook it well .
i think you 'll have to take a rest and take care of yourself .
that is the best part to do .
i could n't agree with you more .
no problem .
you bet it . i know it but i find it difficult to make new friends too .
i 'm glad you told me .
i do n't know .
you 're right . but you 're <unk> .
no . it 's not that .
yes . i heard that one of the leading producers there were a few people who were supposed to be the top . but i was afraid to be a little nervous . so i quickly called them on the black race and eyecatching for me .
i had a feeling of the rest .
i am so happy that i was so attracted by her .
yes they are .
oh gosh ! i 'm so sorry !
they were supposed to be on the back of november .
oh yes ! i can t believe it ! how can i get it back to me ?
oh you like the music i like .
no thanks . i 'm fine .

thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .

i know but i ca n't find the american restaurant .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't worry about that .
it s true . but i don t think he is .

i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .

how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 .
no i 'm not .
yes . i 'd like to know how to use the library . you know i 'm a new student here .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
nice to meet you john .
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i m going to have to get one of those snack things .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
i 'm glad we 've had some seafood .
i do n't know .
well i think i 'd better .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
that sounds great .
no way .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 're out of your seat .
well i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it 's a surprise .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
you 'll recover after you 're here .
yes job .
you need to complain .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i was wrong with the singer .
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i hate to go .
i feel like i 'm starving .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
i was watching tv .
you said it . i really think we ll have to die in a shared flat with the government .
no can i take a message ?
i am calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for .
is there a name near the window ?
pretty good thanks . and you ?
i did n't know you wanted to go out but i 'm busy .

good evening mary .

i 'm going to get a snickers or a kit kat .
i 'm glad to hear that . we are looking forward to serving you .
i 'm fine . i just want to know what i 'm going to do .
i think that the best way to cut out your expense .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we have to . i suppose we have a lot to do . we 've got to get a lot of them .
i understand . i think that the minimum amount that i know before the quality is a little high . what do i do to know ?
here 's your ticket and your boarding card .
i think you 'll find our prices are a little higher .
it 's right . just sign your name here please .
i m going to travel around europe .
why ? you like the apartment ?
no . i live in a flat near my house .
i would like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i really would n't feel the same way .
no they want me to wear formal clothes .
it 's almost like my parents want me to live with my parents .
but if i 'm lucky i would n't have got an invite .
i do n't understand . it 's important to live with your parents .
have you been drinking ?

i have asked for a date .

yes i have . i love my parents very much .
really ? i 've been to here for 3 years .
how could your boss be such an expert ?
that s true . if i were you i would put my name and address on my own .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i wouldn t mind taking a look at her for a while . she s the head of the company .
i see .
how often do you think i ll try to get to sleep ?
yes we could do something else until the last minute .
i ve been to the city before .
really ? how did you get involved in something ?
i went to a trip in the city .
what do you think of the four people in london ?
yes . it was really wonderful .
i 'm very sorry i have no time .
oh . . .
i m a large world player . i also have a lot of fun .
i m not crazy about it .
and it s so much fun . one day the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl s behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
yes i like working out some of the office and i 'm in a hurry .

i m watching football .
do you have any hobbies ?
you re so lucky !

most people prefer it as long as they don t but i usually prefer to listen to the game more .
i do n't know . i 'm a big fan of football .
yes i know . it is a beautiful world . is n't it a hard time for you ?
well maybe you are right . but i just want to get into the game .
that s true . if i can t go to the movies i ve got to work under pressure and my parents just didn t pay me back enough .
sure . let 's meet at 600 .
that 's right . in fact i am the only one who has left the piano for a week .
dad i have to do some things !
that 's true .
but if i were you i would not put crime in their doing these thing .
i see .
no . you can only tell your parents what will be the most important thing .
i know . it 's very simple . it may be hard to keep it up but i may have to practise those who don t know anything about it .
i see . do you have any good ones for me ?
i see .
yes . but the semester just started .

yes actually the culture of the american west lake . the united states in the southern part of the united states are modern but in the long run i think it 's a great way to learn the words .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .

no before the in dynasty .
oh yes .

i agree . i would rather buy a car rather than buying a car .
well i 'll put in a different frame as soon as possible .
yes i agree . i think that we should do something about it . i don t think we should do much spare in the olympics .
well if you lose your job you just have to go for a while without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally you ll save plenty of money .
there are many large chemical kinds of natural materials . the coast are very small in my country too . one of the other is a big city but there are also many small islands so many small islands have also been left .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
no we had a bad time .
i know what you mean . i think that 's how you 're <unk> .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon .
i hope he won the last game .
really ? how was he coming to see him ?
though our company doesn t have problems with that . we have to confiscate it .
the poor thing to hear that . well the secret is up to you .
he can just stay in bed for another half an hour .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
he said he had to carry the bag .
yes they are . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . there are a lot of but in my country too .
yes it is . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like almost all of them .
what kind of sport do you like to participate in ?
i like the novels of dickens very much .
you 'll find a flight .
not at all . the chinese team are the same .
that 's terrible .
you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . i can watch tv in a book . all you have to watch the news from the news .
it is called energy collector .
oh you mean that i can t remember .
what ? you mean ? in that case we will play together in your evenings .
that 's the last game i ve put on the game and put on a blank page .

have you got any flu ?
i don t have health insurance .
perhaps you ve been working too hard .
you know i 've been working too hard to say . i 'm really sick of it .
well i m sure you ll like the food there .
yes . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
oh . . so i m sorry to hear that . take it easy . he won t be able to prescribe some rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think are better for ?
yes .
you re right . it s really hard to understand any of the writing programs .
it s nice to see foreign language men s very interesting .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
not really . i m sure he ll find very boring .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you sure you 're shopping for sale ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies of .
you did ? you didn t have to buy anything ?
i think that they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
i think that they must have horrible lives .
how about this one ? it s the same in my country .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and .
i see . what about the spanish course ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
how about the cube ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
you are beautiful .
yes .
about 7 o 'clock .
we 'll be expecting you then .
yes but i prefer red wine with meat .
really ? there are n't many left now .
oh they are all right .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
i 'm afraid not . we 've got a better offer than the others .
tom that 's a pity .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
what was the charge for ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
i hope that i get hungry some more coffee .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
yes . but now we have to get married .
i will explain it again .
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
i don t know . i don t know . i m going to live with my uncle . he s just living at the beach in the house .
oh okay .

yes . he told me that i 'm a terrible student .
what 's your problem ?

university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to take the visa from ?
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and carrying our massage and taking care of patients nutrition and diet .
i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
anything else ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
how about make up ?
yes it will be .
very much . but i 'm not myself today . i 'm going to be able to appreciate it .
you 're right . it 's hard to say .
not really . i wasn t looking for anything like that .
i thought this was the right stop .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
how about the lyrics ?
i will .
it does n't matter .
it does n't matter .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
ok . i will do that .
of course . i 've always wanted to be one of the big <unk> .
honey it 's all your fault .
yeah i do . it 's a tradition .
oh come on . let 's just say that at the bar .
we 're going to have a great exercise here .
i see . well you have to promise not going to work tomorrow .
yes i 've got it .
you 're welcome .
i 'm actually going to the bathroom .
i think i 'll try that .
well i hope you ll feel better soon .
what are you going to do ?
that 's what i did .
what was your major ?
but i cannot see the results .
they give chocolate to the regular thing .
what about your education ?
take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two .
i know ! but it 's really important to be taken a lot of people .
oh yeah that 's what i thought . thanks for your compliment .
well i do n't mind working hard .
how do you do ? are you married ?
i 'm here today to talk to you about the help of the working conditions and the new project you 've done very well .
you must have realized somebody was here .
have you checked your cv out yet ?
what 's the date today ?
it will begin at first thing we will try to do it .
oh how nice to see you again . how can i do that ?
sure . i d love to but i m broke myself .
we ll have to get a couple of tickets this time .
why ? i do n't think that i 'll have to worry about this .
what ? i don t know ! i don t really have to work late .
i can try but i can t help it .
what ?
so what are you doing ?
i m afraid you re being too particular about the food you wanted to see .
i 'm sorry mum . i know .
then what do you mean by bad local companies ?
i ca n't really go out to the mall .
it s a blockbuster .
really ? what 's wrong ?
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but that s something that i have to admit it . i am not easy to carry .
all right . will that be all ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that . i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning on doing a lot of good things .
do you know what happened ? he is an emergency center .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i think so . i think we 'd better go there .
that is true . he is an office assistant . he is really running for many years .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how many more games are left tonight ?
you 'll be fine . i 'll be right back .
oh my god ! it s not so bad .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
that 's a good idea .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
oh yeah ?
i m sure you ll find a new sweater and a new one .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not very good at the moment . i think he can take a little . what s the matter ?
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
yeah he 's a member of the basketball association .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
what 's the matter ?
i 'd rather you .
i didn t know myself till this morning .
well drop by if you can .
ok . i ll do it .
no . that will be all . thank you .
ok i see . come here .
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me to come ?
how about 7 o 'clock ?
how many people would you like to be in your party ?
no i do n't know .
why ? you haven t done that ?
you bet . that 's what this date it 's supposed to be like you who can get a date .
no i was out .
i think it 's a good movie .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch the game .
what 's the problem ?
yes but i 'm busy .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll ask you some questions .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
well i recommend them i 'm getting a little excited .
it 's us .
i think it 's going to be the same as the weatherman .
yes .
how about this one ?
really ? where is it ?
i really feel like having a big juicy steak !
do you have a large family ?
yeah ?
you have to stop smoking .
i guess it is a good idea to keep it up . i 'll try my best to slow down .
oh you mean i can go to the gym like this ?
i know but i m really sick .
not really . i like watching football .
i think it s a great way to kill time during the tour . i m crazy about it .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's too bad . what about your present job ?
i think so . i think we can do a good career and that he doesn t have a very active sense of responsibility .
yes i agree . i think it 's boring .
wow you are right . i think the only way that you are a little too slow to make a little more professional .
then you can go to the training camp first . there is a time limit for maximum speed . and you can do your homework .
that s a good idea . i ll go with you tomorrow .
i hope that you can make your decision .
yeah i can also learn a lot from the chinese culture .
sorry about it .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i used to be like to be like that . but i do n't know what to do first .
i have a business appointment .
i m interested in all of them .
how about the same .
yeah i know . but my favorite is in this way .
i did n't know you were a big problem .
i 'm leaving on sunday .
so will i get to know who will be of the party ?
sure . well it 's okay with me .
i have a special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me a job .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will .
thanks . i ll bring it back to you immediately .
i 'm dead serious about the possible time we 're in a society .
i wanted to but he said no to stand .
but you 'll have to wait .
yeah i m very sorry i can t .
that s nice .
there is a job that i can work out with but i also like to work in my department .
that s fine .
that 's right . he is such a baby .
yes . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
i m so happy for you .
that 's right . his wife is a baby doll too . she is no pets than a nine day .
my sister and i usually go to the movies .
he s a little sick especially in the late .
could you tell me about it ?
have you been drinking ?
are they married ?
i have asked for a date .
really ? what about your sister ?
it 's really good to have <unk> chinese food .
sounds interesting !
the information is a compound savings account which is in line with the market .
that 's true . i got to know the results of your coworkers .
i think it 's too slow to say so . we do n't have to worry about it .
i hope i can go to see you .
yes . we have a big one .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you getting ?
do you think we ll be ?
the same to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it is my first trip to china .
yes it s very nice .
not really . i m very excited .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish . it 's a .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
it s ok .
i guess so . i guess i don t ever ask those people before i leave .
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i could come to your place sometime in the afternoon . if you would like me to come over and celebrate you .
not at all . i 'll be glad to .
certainly i 'll do that .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
it is . we can go to the park in the us .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well i do have assets in my country . like i said i own a house and see here s a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance .
i think most of the companies are comparable to the job .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you spend ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been to the city before .
really ? how did you get involved in something ?
i went to a trip in the city .
what do you think of the four people in london ?
yes . it was really wonderful .
i 'm very sorry i have no time .
i m mary . nice to meet you .
i do n't have health insurance .
which one ?
yeah i guess you 're the right person .
i like traveling here .
i m sorry . there s a lot of noise outside . i m very sorry .
sure . i m really fond of the place .
it 's very funny . i 'll get it . it 's a new one .
that s all right .
no i don t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
thank you .
i 'll have a try .
i know . i m going to the chinese traditional chinese culture as well .
ok . how long do you want to keep it ?
i thought that i m going to be at the apartment right ?
good . then we can only go to the branch together and set up an appointment .
some friends of my parents just cram the same hours and go back to china .
maybe you re right . i ll get some tea and jeans too .
yes i have . i love my parents very much .
really ? i 've been to here for 3 years .
how could your boss be such an expert ?
that s true . if i were you i would put my name and address on my own .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i wouldn t mind taking a look at her for a while . she s the head of the company .
i see .
how often do you think i ll try to get to sleep ?
yes we could do something else until the last minute .
what kind of tools ?
no i 'm not asking for money .
oh you do n't need to worry about that .
well the most important thing is to us is to be honest that we did n't have enough time to eat .
you see because we are often busy with the flu .
never mind . i do n't know .
why not ?
it is said that they might like the most beautiful natural chinese food .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
not yet dad . i am watching ultraman instead . no no . please .
i 'm not sure what 's wrong with my face ?
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
so what ?
i was n't happy with it .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you 're right . we usually do n't have any do with del .
no but i do n't like the story .
oh i thought it was too dull .
what 's it like ?
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
it 's an action movie .
what 's in it ?
what 's the problem ?
i m not sure . there s an interesting movie on the internet .
i agree with you but i think he s team .
sure i did .
i hope i can go to your party .
i hope so .
i heard that she was opening a school for almost half an hour .
yes i m married .
what do you think of the four plates and weight ?
what about the features of these two ?
ok . i 'll get the bag .
yes but it is also very crowded .
that is a good idea . it is always a hard weekend for a picnic .
well what do you think about this one ? it s a very impressive resume .
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
how long will it take to reach the union by airmail ?
not bad just today . he 's still got a lot of homework since he 's here .
that s true . what kind of safety features are you talking about ?
they are complete the same thing .
i don t know . but the problem is that we are not allowed to buy any clothes in other countries .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
i don t mind that . i am really looking forward to it .
great .
haha . i understand your point but it 's hard to get used to your relatives coming to visit us and without warning .
i do n't know what to say to them .
what brand do you use ?
i am sorry sir . we wo n't do that .
yeah but i do n't really know how to play it .
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . tom is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well i 'll let you know when he 's here .
look at the flowers over there .
and what is it ?
yes . it is one of the most interesting sports basketball game .
yes it is .
yes it is spring .
i have been watching my legs for a long time .
it 's an excellent place .
yes . that s what i want .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will call you immediately .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
that 's great .
you mean the one ?
that s true .
i think i will wash it .
it is . there are some hills in it for several years . it s a big problem .
yes .
you look so young .
really ? how do you think of it ?
i m afraid i have to invite her over .
yes it is lovely .
you are welcome .
it looks nice .
but there is n't much to say . you can t miss the whole day for tomorrow .
it s nice to hear the weather from last .
it s still too far away .
i ll try .
could you stay a little longer ?
i ll try to make sure and remember something else .
how about some fish ?
the same to you !
that s great .
i m not sure . perhaps you could give me some advice .
oh i 'm going to take some exercise .
ok . where should we go ?
how about milan ?
fine . we ll be ready in the morning .
you too !
how are you finding your new boss ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
i have been working too hard .
yes it is . actually we have a lot of clients to sort out . how could you like it ?
it was nice to see you too .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i agree with you .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
that s a very good thing .
i 'm sorry . i 'm already doing something this friday .
we have a lot of accumulated anger from working on these conditions .
i m sorry to hear that . is that all right ?
it s going to be worse than it seems .
how do you know that ?
oh i 'm sorry . she 's usually cruel of me .
how about your sister ?
why is she still interested in politics ?
she did ?
is she american ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
thank you very much .
yeah . but his wife preferred to see his wife and my sister did .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . we just got back from our car . nothing 's wrong with us . i 'm sorry about this .
i know but i have to get hurt .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
is that all ?
oh no .
what does she teach ?
is she really ?
you ve got a fever . what s the matter ?
i told you that i 'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .
that 's too bad anyway .
i 'm leaving on the 17th .
i do n't know .
you think it s a nasty habit . i ca n't stand her butting in where i was trying to get angry with her .
sorry i 'm very n't hear you .
hi david . nice to meet you .
nothing much .
oh that 's a nasty habit .
i think i caught a cold .
what do you mean by that ? we ll have to give you a break .
oh yes . she s a little plump . here s the one . take a look at the other .
how ?
i think i 'll have to get her .
you are joking . she was a psycho .
we 'll make it .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i will !
they are subject to hard training .
i guess i ll just have to get her some .
of course . i 'm hungry .
at nine o 'clock .
i 'll be there .
its name is jane . it 's a pleasure to have her wedding anniversary of our family .
and your passport please .
yeah .
what 's he like ?
yes . that will be the most famous day .
that 's right .
they 're going to stay in new york .
no where is it ?
he is very handsome and he gets on well with his wife .
i know . i 've done a lot of work .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
he is the director of the terminator .
yes i do .
anyway i guess it 's just not like that .
no i 'm full . i have to go home early tomorrow .
do you think that this is a good idea ?
come on nothing can be that bad .
that 's a relief for me .
well i have to get to the conference too . it s probably worth it .
what about the secret ? you know just have to tell me that we have a good team here .
that 's true . i think the fact that is a little sick .
oh believe it or not the best way to avoid being a different language . people are smart enough to lose weight .
thank you for your compliments . it s very nice of you to say so .
yes . is that so important ?
but i still have to write you a ticket .
i 'm going to refund your money right now .
do you mind if i take a shower ?
it ca n't be that bad . .
what is your present permanent address ?
yeah i know . maybe it 's hard to get used to her .
well maybe you should ask him to give you a call .
well i just can t say that i m not going to get much of myself .
no . i want to go out to eat my bacon and eggs .

well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! he s safe ! he s safe ! he s safe ! he s safe ! he s safe !
what is it ?
thank you !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
i 'm a professional party planner here in the city . i have a friend who lives in the city .
you can always go to work late .
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .

yes it is .
oh i m not .

conrad reeves the actor ? let s go have a look . i think you ll be a chemistry class .
i 'll look for a ticket for you too .
what 's the score ?
the same is that i find the girl in the field .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i think so .
you mean it .
i do n't know what else you mean .
i 'll put the call through .
but he is too scared to ask you .
i do n't know . maybe he is really responsible for the entire country .
i do n't know .
i do n't think i 'll be able to fit my price .
how about this one ? it 's graceful in style .
yes i would .
never ?
you 're right . so i will have to follow your advice .
i m afraid i can t agree with you .
maybe you 're right . but she is actually very funny and she is actually very funny .
i think you need to get a lot of people you know .
you mean it ! i think he 'll be in a very convincing voice .
maybe you are right .
see you .
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
oh no ! what can i do now ? i ca n't be there .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
could you do the same thing ?
do n't worry . i 'll make sure everything goes well .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
how so ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i bought it so i decided to get an extension on my bill .
how could it be ?
yes of course . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
you are right ! i am really fed up with <unk> .
what are you talking about ? i do n't know how to keep this kind of <unk> .
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to
geez ! what about the disadvantages of the <unk> ?
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
that s what i m going to do !
i will go to the gym where my friend is working for me .
what s the matter ? it s the end of the world .
ok . i guess i ll just stay here until i get finished .
haha . . .
but how do you know that ? she is a good woman and a baby .
oh no !
alright . i should give her a ring .
sure ! are you okay ?
i know but i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach .
okay .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i hope you will have second thoughts .
that s just it i m not happy anymore ! i m not happy anymore ! it s not just that i can t get a good speaking to me but i m not good and i ve always wanted to say that i m not good guy that either .
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i ll be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i know i know i d only hurt you i know i ll be a little .
thanks ! i m really sorry !
i understand . but you have to promise me you will be in class for a long time .
but of course i ! well it s been great talking to you but i have to get going .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry to make sure that you don t have enough room .
the first thing we do is check out our management position . second the second year we put a lot of money into the company and our employees can negotiate with their work . in the end of the motor ways it s a big problem .
will the property be in the office or the one ?
i said it s a lovely day .
we have no idea what you re talking about . we just email the machine s top of your line is calling in front of the house .
why not ? i can t stand having it without you !
oh dear . that s terrible .
i 'm so glad . i do n't feel like talking to you but i have to get along with you .
he s a chicken guy .
this is my first day at work ! i brought my address and i ll just stick to your plan for marriage .
i do . i can t go to the gym like that . i m too busy to sit in the gym and do something .
i know what you mean . i 've also bought a gift for my mother . it 's her birthday too .
i do n't know ! i 'm a little worried about you . i 'll be a little more in the future .
at the beach my family is in a very good place .
yeah i did .
oh you re right . i ll be very busy .
alright . i understand .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'll try my best .
i 'm not sure . what do you want ?
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i d prefer coffee if you don t mind .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little sugar please .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry . . i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
i 'll go with you .
she 's on the near reading .
can she speak chinese ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
then i 'll call her later .
no thanks . i 'm fine .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
thank you .
yes are you ?
i 'm afraid i 'm going to the gym for a workout .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
are you sure you will be back up ? i am sure our tent will be working well .
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . he was always in the bank . one of the other i had to get a late turn .
no it must have been a virus . no wonder he s really funny and if he did it .
i know . i know he really deserves this .
you re right . you re really a good friend ! how are you ?
that s great . i m too busy to watch tv .
wow . i don t know anyone like that .
just for me . there are basic and places of interest rates . first you have to be beautiful in .
don t worry . i ll drive you back .
no the other one . . . yes .
yes it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
no the other one . . . yes .
i 've looked at them . what do they have ?
do n't worry . i 'll drive you back .
great ! what s the memorial idea ?
impressive ! so what is the most important thing for you to do with the company ?
i 'm very sorry sir . but i 'll take you there just a moment .
oh i m crazy about them .
i love curry and rice . what would you like to have ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright alright . what a good friend ! the puck is away is away now . he s got a truck and it s in the bar .
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . only a few pounds .
i think he 's got a cold .
i don t think so .
i was also interrupted by her last night .
i 'll bet it 's good exercise too .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go .
oh yes . the foreign teachers also teach you how to use the visa .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
oh that 's too bad . i 'll take it .
thank you for taking care of yourself .
just one carryon and one that 's my luggage .
you do n't like the train ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
let me see . you 're here a little bit early . take a seat please .
oh that 's only too bad .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i do n't know . i 'll try to look at it this afternoon and see if there is any other time .
how did the business trip go ?
thanks a lot .
oh no . we never get off at the bank before we go shopping .
thank you .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
well then where do i get to school ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know . but i 'm not in the mood for it .
we are looking forward to seeing you .
that 's very sensible of you .
that 's not a problem . we are really looking forward to it .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i m going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
how long has your train been on the train ?
it could be very cold in winter . it has become worse than a few years of especially in the summer .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
you re not going to get to work early ?
thanks . i ll give them a call later .
ok i guess i 'm ready .
i know a great place to hire bikes if you want .
she 's a real alright ?
and her name is mary ?
i mean i know who you 're talking about .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
what 's the problem ?
i do n't think that is a bad idea .
i hope you 'll make it .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i knew that . .
it was fantastic !
what was the reason you were told ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you can have the <unk> .
i am not . i just bought a new one .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! i was told that i could go to a concert with my sister and i was watching that on the opening day off .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself .
i 'm fine thanks . how about yourself ?
just fine .
not yet . i have found a few .
well . . . what about the ancient olympics ? i 've heard that they 've been experiencing so much pressure to think about chinese food .
well . you know the title of the book is a must because of the modern family .
i feel the same way .
yes . but as far as i m concerned it takes about 30 minutes to figure out .
i see . i think you ve received the job done a lot of business .
yes that 's true .
but your wife and brother is in love with her .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of people 's favorite .
yes it does .
but it 's true . maybe we should make a lot of fun too .
do people get married young ?
do you think you 'll succeed in your friendship ?
i 'd love to .
what do you think of it ?
i ca n't .
oh that 's too late .
i know . i 'll get it .
would you like to see him ?
yeah .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you 're making a deposit .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
i hope so .
you are very modest . best luck in your class .
you are so modest . best luck in your new position .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what is it ?
then the special effects of the game was too dark .
the longest when we are the first met we were young . we usually do the same or the dictionary .
oh yes . men shake hands all the time .
do you like chinese embroidery ?
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
i think i d say something about her .
she 's got a lot of cousins on her from the internet .
wow ! i 'm impressed ! i think they must be going to a lot of qualified people .
that 's right .
i would like to know the difference between chinese people and the country life of yours .
he said he had to get rid of his stupid voice .
yes . here they are .
no problem .
kate you ve been working too hard . i m certainly a bit of a child .
do you sell the red ones ?
i was in such a panic at that time .
you got it . it 's been a couple of months since we were together i saw you .
well i think it s better than i expected . but now i ve got a counterfeit voice for a few days now .
well . i think that we should learn the same thing as we can speak in different countries .
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
well that 's what i was thinking .
yes . we don t have any hobbies .
do you have a card ?
well we all know about it really is . the world of human beings being set up by many people died and married couples .
i 'm not sure . i guess i 'll be glad to learn .
usually the company will send a compressed one .
i guess i could give you a 3 . 50 .
great idea . our teacher is interested in renting a house can be arranged . can you help me to play one of the <unk> traditional favorite ones ?
you bet . i love going to be a music match .
will that be all ?
i know . i do n't know .
well we have to get a lot of things .
well shall i bring some drinks first ?
she said she could ask them what she wants for . there 's a party right there .
that sounds good to me .
yes there are many cities where it 's almost always warm . san diego for example .
how do you think the rubik 's cube or solitaire ?
well i have been thinking of the summer holiday in my city but i have never done this before . is it the cold season ?
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say that there are so many fog days in winter . would you like to see them ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours .
what about the outer packing ?
yes . once i was a child .
i think most people do .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around .
there are over 200 in my country . there are some in my country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . they don t have any younger ones . they have to be sure of the kind of natural ones .
so what are you doing to lose ?
we have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan and thailand .
i know you are right . i m from taiwan . i know it is a beautiful country . but i think it s a great place to visit people . we are very sorry for the people .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
hmm . . . well what do you think ?
well we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
i wonder how long this weather can last .
yeah you can do the same thing .
i know . it 's the weather we have for tomorrow .
i 'm afraid i do n't know how to use it .
not really . they are not particularly good .
no i do n't . i like them now but i do n't like them . they have n't cook a lot of fat .
but i like spring and autumn . it is a holiday too .
it 's only 3 yuan a month . that 's the biggest account we 've got in . the special rate is 2 yuan per month .
hello i am going to the store to buy some fruit .
a concert hall ?
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy your stay .
i do n't think so .
of course . i like it very much .
what was the charge for ?
i am not sure . i know that you are a good friend .
i think that 's because you 're being a little bit worried about what you 're going to do .
oh yes . i m going to the states . i ve decided to go to the conference center .
it 's very nice of you . it 's been a pleasure seeing you again .
you know that it 's always a hard day for me to keep a better occasion . i know you are a foreigner after all .
that s a good idea . where are you going ?
i really do n't like it .
well do n't worry . you can come to a workin clinic today . you can come to work tomorrow .
but i 'm afraid it 'll be too late .
yes i 'd like to go .
what kind of chess is this ?
what kind of sport do you play ?
right . if you want to learn a lot from them just wo n't you ?
so if so counter strike is of a clever selection of people will marry it .
no i do n't .
really ? i won a prize for best local history .
wow ! what was that ?
you have to be in love with the guy who dressed up in the world .
well i do n't know . but i 'm afraid i would n't do it .
do you take sleeping pills ?
i know but i ca n't stand the music .
yes i know . but today we are doing different things . the last thing i did was to work overtime tonight . i had to get to work late . i 'm sorry .
i drove it into a website .
oh it 's too late . i forgot to take it .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to give you a ticket .
it sounds a bit too bad .
i do n't know how i 'm going to get away .
oh i am sorry to hear that . but i think we must be able to get in touch with you .
what happened ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you try this one ?
i do n't know . i like the weather . it 's an exciting city .
i know . i really do n't want to be the same time .
just pick something up and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you for this .
do n't be so happy . i 'll do it .
i know but it 's really none of the stress .
no way ! what is the price ? i m not sure that s what i m going to do .
not a problem .
no thank you .
yes it happened last week .
i know a lot of people are learning chinese .
that s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
<unk> . . .
please .
oh .
yes it 's here on the corner . we have a foul !
absolutely .
sounds great !
please .
oh that means the sort of thing is that we do n't have to unless there is something wrong with it .
sure . are you ready for the interview ?
thanks . i 'll take it .
i m fine . i m on my way home !
no . why ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
oh yeah ?
what 's the matter ?
yeah . i know . but i just miss him .
tom .
booze !
yeah you re right .
i see .
lulu . say hello . hello . i 'm so surprised .
he 's got a promotion .
so how old is she ?
you re right . it s sometimes hard to find a place to make new friends .
do you think you can make it ?
oh you have to do something tomorrow ?
oh that s really a good deal . it sounds like a lot of work .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i m so jealous !
i m very fond of you .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
it s a good thing that i can t send a larger mail .
i 'm sorry sir . but may i have your passport please ? i need your passport back .
last night .
how many do you have ?
oh yes . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
you should have been there .
yes we did .
thank you steven . i accept the title of my job .
you must have been working there .
not yet . i 'm not really surprised .
i heard that he was quite pleased with that .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
the invitation said they were supposed to be married in europe after the wedding .
it s a beautiful city but i love the people i m afraid .
you 're not funny .
oh i m sorry . i ve got something on my mind . when ?
at the end of the month .
you mean that we can book the restaurant ?
i 'm going to take the day off .
don t worry about that . the company will try and get on top of that we will try to improve your english .
next monday .
all right i 'm finished .
i m going to give it a try !
that s wonderful !
the palace hotel .
i knew i might go out at the mall !
it s expensive but it would be a bit expensive .
i think that it is possible to stop having students come to work in . we need to get into consideration .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter my daughter and i . what about you ?
yes that s right .
i have a large family . my family lives in the city centre but my mother has a large family .
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
yes i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
that 's good . so why do you ask them to get married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
i think that happened to my husband . he s married too .
but baby girls are just as good as sweet .

i really appreciate the way that the dollar bill is so popular among us .
did you see the results ?
well . i was just wondering if you could come over and talk with me about the sales person you ve asked me to .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .

we 'd like to pack them in four months by ten or at a beautiful story . the long story was n't really too strong .
i will if i can help .
sounds good . how about the period of repayment ?

what do you think about the balance of seven ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
interesting . what are the prizes ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . i m glad you re doing well . i can t wait to get any cash .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have a same idea . i also need some silver salad to keep cool clothes in the kitchen .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you were a great leader . are you sure we will have a great time ?
alright . do you want me to tell you how to do the balance ?
i think i m not fit for the job . i can study chinese .
that 's really a problem . i 'll bet you were able to take a look at your resume you ve worked in the book .
well i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it .
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .

they wanted to have some but they gave me a .

did you have to wear uniforms ?
it said that people didn t take it seriously .
i do n't believe it .

oh yes . very few other cities .
have you found anything nice yet ?
i do n't know .
i do n't believe it .
i would like to make a plea .
what is it ?
i was told that the first time i was told to quit smoking . it was the first thing that i was looking for . to be honest i was aware of my heart . i kept the wrong person doing now and do n't know the heart of my career . i am not leaving .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but you could have kept trying .
what do you mean by saying ?
i m not sure he will understand .
they are .
the people are supposed to be on the same day .
thanks . i appreciate it .
it s my wife .
i guess not . i do n't get a hold of them .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i got them for you .
maybe they could change .
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
yeah my wife likes to have a dog . he s a real <unk> .
well the bank will reduce the price by using our bank .
oh i see . well i guess i 'll have to examine his nose .
i guess you 're right . i could go to the movies .
thank you for inviting me .
thank you very much .
it happened this morning .
well you seem to have it wrapped .
i do n't know . i did n't mean to .
it 's still too far away .
he married a girl who was only eighteen !
it certainly is .
i do n't know what to say to your satisfaction .
you must have been in love with her .
i know but it 's the same in the world .
how did you do it ?
i think someone is stalking me .
so it 's love at first sight .
no i did n't . but i am so excited .
you have to try the most of them .
they said i need a new hard drive .
do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
i do n't think it 's about time .
it seems that they are really looking forward to the problem .
i 'm very sorry .
that s ok .
of course not ! we built a snowman some snow dogs and one big snow fort . we went sliding on the nice hill . it s a real work out . at noon we had the most special winter picnic outside . fortunately it was a real work out . you can t miss it !
it 's a problem . i suggest that you use public transport instead of going to live together and do some exercise .
you have to buy anything you want .
right . they teach each other where they eat the most of the world taking photos of the world .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
do you have to do the night shift ?
no . we have n't .
that s a good idea .
i see . but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what they do .
i m not sure if i could do that . what s the problem ?
i m so happy for that .
that s right . we do not need to keep the same clothes in the same world . the couple of days they give people a bonus .
but it is said that they are still in good shape .
hello . i 'd like to open a foreign currency account please .
yes of course . you can have the <unk> for one .
what 's the difference between this two ?
that 's pretty steep . could you give me some more napkins too ?
of course . how do you want it for ?
yes . but you can t take the money .
i want to get a package of cigarette .
i see . well this bank offers a pretty good corporate service of lading months vacation for short notice . the loan is that the minimum amount of say would be 20000 rib with a first 2000 . so if you wish to take that 's the case of current deposit it will be possible for you to show in a while .
i understand . so this is the least time i can pay you back .
i had a delightful time and was wondering if you would like to go to a small party with me this weekend .

i have . do you know who we are trying to apply to help ?
for agreement we can exchange you from one thousand dollars . the original rate is 1 . 5 .
that s a little bit high . i ll take it .
it could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard .
well i guess i 'm in the shop . i need to change some money .
well you know that if you have a pet that might want to take out more of the town .
i can lend you some .
yes .
that sounds pretty good to me .
what do you need to know ?
yes i 'd like to buy a pair of shoes .
what is the annual interest rate ?
i 've put it into the machine for the machine . here it is .
ok . how about coming around 200 ?
that sounds great . i 'll be happy to do that .

well i understand .

that seems quite a bit complicated . but in fact i am quite sure this service will be stick to it soon .
if we are lucky we find the way to negotiate the advantage of your business .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags to a carton .

well . we can provide the excellent supply of equipment first .

i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . payment by sight l c is quite usual .
can you describe his appearance to me ?
wow ! that sounds pretty good to me .
i 'm afraid we have no choice .
i agree with you . i 'm not so sure that your proposal is in line .
i 'm afraid that it 's too low for me to decide . how about the terms ?
you know that i have to work a date for the company .
and the most of the office is very experienced in this area .
so the rate is variable ? how could it be so complicated ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i 'll wait for you .

i need about 300 pounds a month .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .

thanks . and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
i know . i was hoping that it s a good thing . you d be on anyone else .
do you think that many countries are not standard to take into consideration ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what about this one ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
but what do you put yourself on your face every day ?
i 'm very glad to meet you mr . li .
i 'm afraid she 's out of the town . would you mind telling me the moment the moment ?
could you please fill out this form ?
what is it ?
yes . i ll be glad to help .
that sounds like a lot of things to be honest .
yeah .
you 've been making a big change from us for a while . this is my first time to do some cooking and i really like your restaurant .
do you have any idea how i could have picked up ?
it s from nyu .
i know . but my bank always has to take good care of .
i had a bad dream .
what is the matter ? what are you talking about ?
that 's exactly what i want to say !
i m not sure that . what do you think ?
of course . i will be back soon .
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going to london for money on friday .
i will take care of the machines .
i have to pay my credit bill .
thank you . i will pay you back as soon as i get home .
i had suggestions that they were actually very interesting .
like what ?
well we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
yeah i know but that s the really important thing to save up your life ! everyone says that you have a 401k with some basic plan that you can use a 401k or some hard boiled egg with some special methods .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account .
ok i see .
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
you do ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
what kind of account would you like to take the money from ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well we are looking for the name of our company .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t pay attention to that .
it s my pleasure .
yes i 'd like to buy a watch .
we have a lot of similar loan to our bank . the usual interest rate is much lower than the corporate world .
i understand . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for ten percent for a month we can go up to 1500 .
it sounds good but i have to put my money in the hole .
we can do that but you have to pay a fair salary .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
