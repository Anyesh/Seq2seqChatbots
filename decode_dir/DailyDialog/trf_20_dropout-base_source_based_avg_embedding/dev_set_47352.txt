reserve a table for four at 8 00 p . m .

well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
it 's rather too expensive . can you make it any cheaper ?
thank you .
sure . . .
oh i did n't see it .
sure . but you have to park in the car first .
sure . you may think of some kind of art or fish .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it was n't me .
that 's what i need .
all right . i 'm finished .
hi .
what happened ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .

i will .
no i 'm afraid not . it 's too heavy .
i ll bring it to you in a moment .
yes we have a reservation .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
i need to cancel a check .
that s right . as you know we are a vegetarian diet to banana some kind of pie .
how many nights a week is it ?
a small bag . i guess we also need a few oranges .
can i pay by card ?
the buying price is included in the dressing room .
it was n't me .
that 's what i need .
ok . do you know the name of the company ?
thanks very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
sure . here you are .
i want to try a new hairstyle . could you show me some pictures of hair styles ?
well . i think the color is a bit too bright .
it 's nice but it 's not very expensive .

it 's not really very fresh .
well we have nicer things than that in this company . you can find a house then .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
yes . it 's a heavy board .
hey ! watch out the game ! you 're the same guy !
yeah . you know what ? they 've got the dollar ones and then tell me the secret of putting together a birthday present .
well you can t just throw him on the sidewalk . he must be mad at you .

how long does it take you to cook it ?
yes . there are several different kinds of clothes in my country . i have never had enough to carry on with them .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no you should have it . i m going to the bedroom .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .

you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it 's true that just the most important thing to do .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what are we going to do now ? i 've got to woke up this morning .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

let me have a look at it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm not much of a dancer and i have to go to the gym .
but if the interviewers are in the states they will be able to learn the piano they will have a good time .
here you are .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go .

not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i know but junk food is so popular .
what kind of work are you doing now ?
i was denied a visa ?
it 's lovely but to be frank it 's not the most practical . you do n't have many formal events in your calendar do you ?
um . . . if it does n't work i 'll bet it does n't even run . .

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper .
can you tell me about the safety of the computers ?
i 'm not really sure but i think it 's too fierce .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
that 's good ! do you know you want to go to the movies with me ?
i know . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
the price is reasonable because the charge is much higher .
it 's only a couple of dollars .
how long will the tour take ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind of sports do you usually play ?

thank you very much .
how do you find product on a website for a person ?
i had no idea . i just ran into my car and my bank for a while . i needed a new engine to open the hood and we re taking a side of coffee with a few things .

why do n't you call them ? they call them the dead .
doctor i have a headache .

we are all the same in this line . let me help you .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
that 's great .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
the ones that are on sale are from central america .
we have a lot of problem . what s wrong ?
i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
yes . could you deliver it for me ?

i 'm not too worried about it . i 'm not a big fan of it .
i just need to know about it .
what is the rate for that car ?

can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
i 'll take a dozen .
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
why do n't they have a good ear for the shower ?
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
you have a very good journey .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to us
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
i know . it s hard to find a decent place at this time .
you 'd look under the quality .
what 's the price ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
all right . i 'll just get it out of the window .
it 's 4 .
what happens if i 'm not finished with them in the afternoon ?
what about this one ? it 's very fashionable and it 's very smart .

the wine list is on the second floor .

sounds like a good idea . let s see .
how about some dumplings ? i just ca n't get enough of them .
no they 're too bright .
yeah .
of course not . i 'll be glad to .
i m afraid i must have taken a wrong turn .
oh did he ?
yeah it was a good choice .
exactly .
are we going there by bus ?
what did your boss say ?
there are two of you to do that .
it s a beautiful view .
i could try that . it would be a pity if i missed it .
is there a lot of news in the newspaper ?
i see . would you like to have dinner with us on friday evening ?
that 's great .
i d better get that . thank you for your help .
yes . i ve got an old ericsson there . take a look at the other one .

it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
you 're kidding !
here you are .
i see . your name please ?
thank you very much .
hello . is there anything i can do for you ?
what size ?
thank you . mr . johnson . i 'll have to ask you for a wakeup call .
yes . i 'm here to see your bank statement . you need to call me when you go .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
that would be great . what kind of keys would you like to have for the past six months ?
see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i see . . . yes we have quite a few rooms available what companies do you think of this one ?
great ! do you think i can have the new page for our imports ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll try that next time .
i 'll just check .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back ?
i 'm not sure . can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of charge .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
it 's a long time .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
yes i know that . i am very pleased with the director . i hope that the contract could be for you .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place .
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
i go to work at 900 a month for local winter and i go to work at <unk> trade places .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
i do n't know . i am too busy to tell you . and you know what ? i am a little worried .
he does n't mind . he is a hard worker .
oh no . you should send him a fax to class . i 'll go to his medical department and pick him up .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
because i love the snow .
hello mr . higgins please .
wow ! what a wonderful weekend !
i did n't want to hear about it .
a bit . i m very nervous . i m a bit nervous .
not bad . i just got back from hawaii .
oh okay . i 'm glad you 're doing something .
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
you are a very good candidate .
see you .
i am not kidding .
for about two years .
i see . thank you for your time .
she 's a lot like me .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah . i think it 's much better than the regular price .
that means he was n't interested in the position .
but we 'll make it .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule our price .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do . what do you want to know ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
well you might want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
that 's good to hear . i thought you were making this quick decision last year .
your car is open now .
what do you think i can do though ?
all you ever do is have a starter then ?
what are the ones that are on the couch ?
so what are you going to do ?
let 's get it for something . do n't tell me you want .
cool ! i ll do it !
i m sorry sir . i m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
i 'm looking for a house .
are you looking for a small gift for a clerk ?
hmm . . . i don t mind . what s wrong with them ?
are you kidding ? how does that mean ?
how about this one ?
i 'll get one for you .
oh it is a kind of you . i am a foreigner and i like the color of this . so i do n't like the way to play .
that s true .
the neighbourhood is nice too . there is a park nearby .
i see . i think that s why it s so cool .
. . . hey !
i don t think so . i think that an advertising planner should have a face and .
what is it look like a market sale ?
yes . how about this one ?
let s have a look at the battery .
here comes jordan though .
oh come on . i m afraid i can t do that .
no problem .
i 'd like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! please fill out this form and show me your passport .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
thank you .
no . that s it .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . did you bring any gifts back for your picnic ?
ok . i ll pick you up at 600 .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to return this video .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s an excellent question . i m really sorry .
this is a new outfit .
what kind of considerations are you talking about ?
well that s the thing that i ve ever heard . she s a bit lower than a few of the most expensive but that s for our dog .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but it takes a while to find it .
what is your aim in your work ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
what about the training ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
this is a white tshirt and a pair of leather shoes . i 'm sorry but that is not what you need .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no i wo n't . i am a good singer but that 's a good opportunity to do .
thank you . that 's very nice of you .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
damn !
hello . i 'm here to get my salary .
there is a problem with this house . it is very expensive though .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no you don t have to pay it . and we ll throw this huge bill .
awesome !
i had a job with a computer company that went for two years and i am very happy with your work .
we are terribly sorry . you were so kind .
can you tell me something about your work ?
i don t think it s time to pull a bouquet of flowers . i love the same way .
can you please tell me what the problem is ?
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
i like the winter too . it s too cold for me to warm in summer .
yes . i think the quality of the photos will go well with your complexion .
can you tell me about the safety of your salary ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
well it 's nice but it 's usually crowded .
yes . sometimes it is n't hard to find the exact place in the city . but you could get a little more rest .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s amazing !
are there any other seats ?
maybe we could get a few new furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
i love the apartment .
and how much do you charge ?
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s too expensive .
what is the occasion ?
what are you looking for now ?
that s not enough .
i will need your social security and your name and your room number .
would you mind telling me that we re not going to get any money ?
i want to know what the news is .
that s the best i can do .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . i should throw some corn on the grill . i also set up the grill . i also bought some corn on the <unk> while i bought it .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
you are right . i will take them .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
this is my first time . would you like me to try it on ?
i d like to have the latest model .
an ordinary one ? i prefer the smell of hers .
i don t want it then .
that s a good idea . i ll take it .
what about this one ?
of course . the fitting room is right behind you .
i want one with a bath .
all right . you can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
the dress is good .
great . the room is over there .
good .
i m sorry . you can t hear you . can i take a message ?
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make .
i 'm happy to hear that . what 's your apartment like ?
i think that the apartment is a little too big for me .
i 'm happy to hear that . what is the rent ?
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
no i want a chemise .
i 'm ready to go .
thank you .
no but we charge 50 cents for each person .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh . . . . i 'm sure it 's not too late .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . i 'm glad you know .
let s rock n roll .
i think you re right . i just got back from the car business center .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
it 's a plain . where 's the tree ?
the list is a few bedroom and a bathroom .
a dozen with a fine view of the park is because a bathroom and there is a lot of fish in the sea .
i 'll take the pink one .
right now there are three .
but you 'll have to get a pet that is a bit more expensive .
let s sit in the back .
i m not looking for excuses here . i ll come back in a few minutes .
i know . i know . but i 'm not used to looking up every turn in the daytime .
my god ! it 's a nice neighborhood .
i love the bamboo and the view . what is the biggest view ?
the master suite is the best . let 's go look at that next saturday .
that 's right . we will have to think about it .
that s the wine of the main main main thing .
i m the manager here . what can i do for you ?
oh hello mr . wilson . this is mary . are you free to call ?
i need to see that place for the apartment .
well i would love to see the apartment .
let 's go to the park first .
yes i have no problem with 6 p . m .
i will be there for three days .
i have a friend who lives in beijing .
we have a deal with you .
i 'm finished .
we only need to check your driver 's license .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is .
i should attend an interview on the internet .
that 's interesting . could you give any reasons for your choice ?
all right . why do you want to work for us ?
yes .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
oh it 's interesting . what is this ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what do you think about the impossible job ?
i 'm sure you 'll like fisherman's wharf . it 's a popular tourist spot . be sure to try the seafood there .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
oh that 's what i meant .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
would you like a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . i 'm sorry jason . it 's all my fault .
yes . but i want to get a kick out of my coffee .
would you like to have a shampoo ?
not too long . but it 's a bit too short . you know what i really want to cut .
if you like we have a shampoo it will be a lovely one .
i hope so . i 'm not really sure about this style .
you are the one i have ever received .
you are right . the direction of the body will turn on your arm to work .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
really ? ok .
i see . well you 'd better lie down to the police . it 's not just as long as you can .
i bet it . she s a bit strange .
i will give you a call .
okay . i 'll take a shower .
yes i do .
here is the money . you can get a discount on each products .
you look so pale . how about a drink ?
let 's find a route for us . i 'm sure you will enjoy the summer .
oh you 're right . that 's great to meet you . thanks for coming in .
oh . . . . what are you doing ?
ok let s go check out the kitchen next .
ok let 's go check it out .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
that 's great . we will definitely do that .
our computer lab is on the first floor . we can provide you with our training sessions for it .
how much do they cost ?
let s leave the samples and get them back to you .
congratulations ! our garden would make it a little different .
ok let 's go .
is that a good idea ?
yes it 's out of the building .
why ? they are the two brothers living next door ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
ok let 's go check it out .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and an hour for example you need to get things done .
actually if you go to the bus stop in the next block you can take no . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate .
ok . let me help you .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
you have to eat breakfast now ?
i prefer sea food .
that 's not true .
i am not . the food here is delicious .
well it looks very nice .
i like the soy sauce chicken .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with your tea ? it 's delicious .
actually i 've been to most of the countries in china . but now i 've visited many countries and regions in the world . they are doing some special business with people .
that 's right . you do n't like them . the only thing i 've been here for a long time . is your birthday present ?
it 's my favorite .
have you ever tried a restaurant that has a large range ?
you are right . but what kind of music do you like ?
it 's a good idea to have a taste of moutan .
sure . you need to go to the university flea market .
my washing machine is n't working .
yes i know . i need some coffee too . i need a guinea pig !
oh i see . so what about the customer service ? i know they have a wide range of products from .
you can send the email to each other every day and after the interview .
rin ?
you re welcome .
ok let me try .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i think the best way to go for a free inspection .
the prices here is still high .
what time do you close please ?
let me see . oh look here . they are the catalogue and the flowers .
i was also wondering if they could look for a few of them .
yes go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
you are right . but i like the fashion show .
i do n't know . i know a place that has excellent restaurants .
that 's a good idea . put on your computer and your computer often tell you what the topics are going to be so prepares that you can get things done at that .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .

all right . but you have to leave it to me . i 'll call you after work .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . the personal thing is to me is transportation by air . so i 'm afraid i ca n't do that well .
here you are .

i 'm sorry . i was n't so impressed .
that 's wise . if you buy it now we will provide you with a service for you .

let 's go into the parking line first .

i was there .
yes but it 's really exciting .
i do n't know what to tell you .
good gracious . that 's incredible !
i 'm in the market .
that 's wonderful !
i 'm not sure what i 'm looking for .
i have a question . i 'll make a note of it .
yes . i heard that . you must be very excited about the film .
you like the panda express ?
i don t know . there s always much to do . i don t think i ve ever done this before .
well i think you 'd better tell me now and what if you 'll excuse me i 'll go for a job .
i 'm afraid i do n't know the reason for being late .

i said you wanted to have dinner with me tomorrow evening .

yes .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what kind of soup do you like ?
what can i do for you ?
you re welcome .
nothing thanks .
what 's up ?
i was denied a visa ?
how d you get that done ?
i was just wondering what you see on the website .
i agree with you but i think he will do well .
i want to try a new style .
why ? what does he do ?
i have been studying english since junior high school . and now i 'm going to miss english .
i understand . so what did you do ?
i 've just been married for about five years . how about you ?
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
i will be leaving on the fifth of august fifth .
oh it 's the usual practice for a lot of people .
what 's your favorite subject ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
i 've never thought of that .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to the car park . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
what kind of price do you offer ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states .
well i 'm sure you will .
i will miss you too .
what happened ?
i heard that we will call at some ports on the way . is that true ?
you know that 's what i ate yesterday . i thought i 'd come and have a try to relax .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
you 're making a good choice .
what do you do at the same time ?
i 'm fine . how are you doing this morning ?
not bad . how about you ?
i 'm still in england .
of course i have a lot of homework to learn . but i 'm sure you will love it .
oh i see . but that 's what i want to do .
let 's see what i have to do .
see you .
oh . . . i 'm sorry .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i really appreciate it . thank you .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get the scholarship right ?
i think so . the most important thing is that you can take every class in the afternoon . in the afternoon you will be there .
i 'm dead serious .
no trouble at all .
i 've already got a ticket for the concert this evening .
well i believe you can stay in the united states but you 'll have to go to the university of hawaii .
ok . i will go there myself .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh i see . thanks .
we can help you with both know the fact that the senior high school lasts for two years .
i love the apartment . i only want to paint the walls this month . i think it 's going to be a good idea .
we can take the met and get a car map of the street .
i see .
well i hope to see you again soon .

you are right .
i want to study .
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .

not at all . i see you and your family twice a week and i enjoy seeing my own friends . i m too busy to feel lonely !
she 's very nice .
yeah . but he 's not the right person who could be led by the nose .
he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
it 's on the third floor .
yes i have it . thank you very much .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . well i will send a detailed check and records so i can choose my password and the computer will make it out .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . how much is the fare ?
sure . i 'll ring the bellboy to show you the way .
i 'm afraid you ca n't get it . i 've been trying to work without the company .
you re welcome .
my name is bill . how are you doing ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?

but she is very interested in her class .
anything else sir ?
yes i did . but i 'm taking a break from being a bit slow in the mood for a while . what is the tennis club ?
it 's rather serious . it 's your fault .
i was denied a visa ?
did you guys go on a date already ?
what did he say ?
you 're working too hard . but do n't worry . you 'll have a hard time and you 'll do the job .
but it 's so exciting .
i 'm a bit nervous . i just lost my job and i 'm taking it .
it was n't as long as you think it 'll be .
did you go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard it was far out man !
it was n't as good as i would have liked .
that is a wonderful surprise .
i do n't know . i just saw a guy on the street .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident .

it was exciting !
it was also a hard nut nobody likes approaching her .
really ? what about your parents ?
yes sometimes .
how about your mother ?
but i do n't know how to take the medicine there .

i see . did you want to get a home inspection ?
i usually put them into my bank account .
i do n't know . do you know what the temperature is today ?

i 'll have to write you a ticket .
well i 'm always willing to help you sir .

i i know . but i didn t really like the fact that i could take a long time . what s the main thing about that ?
oh my . . . well how can i do that ?

i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
yeah . but he 's not the right person who could be led by the nose .
he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
it s in the cabinet . just take the elevator or the stairs .
you are right . that 's really a bit early . let 's take a taxi .
it 's a small bag in the corner of the building .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
my family attend an hour in the afternoon . in the summer i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the university . i had to go to the university with my family .

i want to go to the university museum . i go to the university of interest .
i understand . but i m not sure if you have any questions just ask me .
that s a good idea . do you have any other questions about the job ?
i remember that . and i think that made the decision to promote the company 's image and getting the right way to promote our company .
i won t stand up any more .
it seems that people can never seem to agree with their campaign .
what can i do to help ?
that s good . is there anything else that you should pay ?
i think that s true but i think people are trying to quit smoking since i m in the united states . there s nothing wrong with our people .
you must be lonely .
very well . thank you .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i want to return this video .
what 's the problem ?
i need to make a deposit .
did you check the periodicals ?
yes i forgot to mention it .
i ll just have to make sure and watch my baseball .
they are on sale today .
i do n't think so . i 'm sure you will .
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see the kind of thing that they got it ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! millions of gigantic stones . . each one perfect . . .
o . k . so what are you talking about ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
there are several sports events that can play on the field . i like the sports series of animals .
and what s that building opposite us ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a chance of see a building on the street ? well let me check . oh there is nothing i can do for you . i know you 're so busy right now .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
oh yes . they are all my hobbies . they are my brother and nephew .
what is the national anthem ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to get a package of cigarette .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?

thanks . who s the author ?
thank you very much sir .
i think that is a very quick meal .

but you 're busy are n't you ?

i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
how many times did you say ?
i 'm going to refund your money right now .
you can hear it .
no i 'm not .
well when you give them a call i 'll come back .
thank you very much .
you can imagine a little bit about that .
yes i know .
well you have to be aware that you have charged quite a lot of time .
what time shall i begin ?
here you are .
yes . go on .
i think you should have a try .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake .
here 's a twenty .
it 's hard to say . it depends on the weight of the year . we can go to the weight of the year .
i 'm in a hurry . how long does it take to get there ?
that 's horrible !
no . i think it 's the very question .
yes . but though i do n't think the exact thing is that i have no wanted to change .
what else can i bring ?
i 'll be back as soon as possible .
i 'm not sure if i have the class but i have to read it .
yes .
sure . just a minute . i ll get the tickets for you .
well i 'll tell him .
yes . especially with the jet lag .
yes it is .
that 's too bad . you are not quick on it .
i think that people should try to speak in no way of thinking .
thank you .
no . i want to know the products you want to do the best job .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
which class ?
it looks like it may rain soon .
the starting monthly salary would be 2000 with rises after the half year according to your competence .
here 's your change .
that 's right . all the main points for the environment by the much pollution levels in the way .
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
no problem i think it 's going to be a lot of fun .
a little bit . are you a medical ?
the main responsibility of the work is when you feel well .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i used to be a public conversation but now i know the importance of their contact is because i 'm living with a famous aunt .
they 're right . . . can i check the weight ?
we are n't going to go to the gym .
i 'm sorry i was just taking you a moment .
we get a day off from the boat and go on a river with friends .
i have been a project manager for over 2 years .
so what ?
not really .
thank you . good night .
we 're doing great . next time i 'm doing well .
i see . the chinese teachers will be there for me .
we are putting a special bowl of videos at least 1 000 yuan a month .
i know . i should have told you earlier . this is a company rule .
our company is very high and we could consider other activities in more business .
i 'm a very good manager . which kind of system do you like best ?
i want to know about the fees you ve been doing .
why do n't you take a look at the safety manual of your job ?
your performance is n't good .
why ? you are so kind !
they are all very reasonable .
what are you talking about ?
i know . do n't worry about it . i 'll make a note of it .
how long is the holiday ?
i need to return a book .
what s the problem ?
yes i have it . here you go .
what ?
yes i 'd like to have one with me .
i ll just cancel your account right now .
but i m not in the mood for this .
now hand me the hammer and those nails please .
here you are .
what ?
i appreciate it .
i 'm sorry i did n't even think of it .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i really love you .
that s ok .
because i am interested in this position .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
the second one i have seen .
no i don t think he will .
i can t wait to see him .
but my friends won t like it . he s a hard worker .
but i like its color .
what 's your favorite color miss ?
all right . how about this one ? it 's a lovely vase .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to be much too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i 've always wanted to be like that .
because of the fine grew up in a better way .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
have you been too busy to get enough sleep ?
i know you should change your mind off . i m trying to find out about the job you ve ever had .
oh yeah . i 've got a few things to do . perhaps i can ask you some advice .
yes .
really ? i m so sorry .
well you d better come to see me now . i ve been calling to see the doctor .
do you have your cell phone with you or call the office ?
have you brought your hotel yet ?
that 's true . but she used to be very relaxed and cheerful . it 's not that strict .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
well you are right . it s not just funny .
so what 's the afterwards ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
i ll try but i 'd be happy to assist you .
you know you did n't .
i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how would you like to do that ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? that 's a wonderful idea .
hey young man you 're still working !
what is it ?
i do n't know .
okay then let 's split it .
i 'll let you know .
so what do you do ?
you are just a quick learner .
how many times did you have to go ?
yes but it 's very expensive .
it 's too bad . why do n't you try and give it back ?
exactly .
oh yes .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
i see . we have some fresh air .
what 's the price ?
are you serious ?
you can count on me in .
i hear that she is very intelligent .
of course not .
i do n't think i 'm in the mood for a presidential seat .
where is your polling place ?
i 'm a .
what kind of wish did you like ?
sure . she is the one who saved the life of life of rose .
hi linda i 'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
she 's a friend of amy .
yes . we are all learning things now .
i like the fact that i get to know her .
oh shut up will you ? she 'd better be at the first sight .
i feel sorry for her .
what about the party ?
of course . she had been very helpful and we needed to make sure our plans were all the way to do that .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yes sir . just a moment please .
maybe she is just visiting it .
i 'll tell you what .
maybe she is n't very busy at the moment .
what 's your aim in ?
if your uncle had an accident and bill should have a look at it .
i am glad you came . i 'll help you try it .
what would you like to see ?
what happened ?
take care of yourself and do n't forget to keep in touch .
sure . i 'm really sorry .
yes i do . it seems that i have to finish this report at the end of the week .
i do n't think this is the act that you did n't .
yes it 's right here .
how many children will have ?
how did he do it ?
i see . dad !
you must be joking . the guy who is in the game .
i 'm not imagining it . he just broke up with me . he was a bit nervous .
well it was about a very old man . he was also our lucky dog .
oh ? what 's wrong ?
sure !
i do n't think so . i do n't think we have a very good time here .
i 'm so sorry taylor . you 're so nice .
which one ?
it 's a really good thing you 're having .
well it was n't just some trouble . . .
i 'm so sorry taylor . i knew you would be so nice talking with you .
i 'm so sorry . she was n't expecting you .
oh how awful !
yes . i got a cambridge business english certificate and a good reputation .
cool ! i ca n't believe he is so stressed . i ca n't believe he is so stressed .
do n't you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
that 's very considerate of you . i guess the hotel could be better .
i think i 'm going to give you a ticket .
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
yes . we can not make it today .
no this is the first time i 've been in china .
well the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
i do n't think so . i do n't think we 're all in the same boat .
just a minute . i ca n't find the gym there .
okay sir but do you have a credit card ?
no we 're gonna make the batter . take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . then add some vanilla extract and eggs and eggs and eggs and wine while you are at the pan .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
yes but it 's not expensive .
how much do you like your home ?
no . mary 's brother does n't .
of course . i will .
really ? i think i will go there myself .
i really appreciate the news .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes . do you know that you 're moving to london ?
that 's too bad .
what was that you just said ? you were only kidding !
but you know things cannot always make up new things .
i will ! i could use the drink !
what can you tell me about your future work ?
i didn t get accepted .
all right . what happens now ?
yes . how much is it ?
that would be a good choice . can you see it ?
i 'll give you a call next week .
thanks . i appreciate it .
i 'm not . i only get a chance to take on my own . i 've never had one before . i 'm staying in a hurry but it 's on me .
no thanks . i 'll have to meet you at the airport .
what kind of soup would you like ?
no this is not gonna . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
good afternoon mr . li . this way please . how are you ?
good morning . what time do you want to go ?
i think it is time for me to move out and develop myself . i want to become a different lady like my career !
you re welcome .
that 's wonderful thanks . thanks for your help .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
do you think we can be better off if we are apart .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show it to you .
come on ! don t be silly !
what s wrong ?
well . . . i think i 'm ready for a new challenge .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
but i have to be back soon . i 'm going to move my car until the police arrive .
i am sorry to hear that .
i really hope that you did n't expect me to pay you for this .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
yeah this place is boring .
do n't stay up late .
we 'd better go out for a walk now .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
what s wrong with it ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
what do you think of the weather ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
it 's blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it 's true that just the most important thing to do .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you 're right . but what are we going to do now ? i 've got to woke up this morning .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
actually let 's see . if we had a great time we 'd have to go somewhere . that 's kind of thing .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
i really hope that you did n't expect me to pay you for this .
i had a fantastic time .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
you know what ? i do n't have a bad cold for a long time .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
you 're a good dancer .
i see .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i see . will i be able to get in touch with the taxi ?
i was late for work today .
yeah . i got sick and tired of her nagging all the time .
what did she say ?
sure . what 's up ?
i want to return this video .
never mind . it 's my fault .
i wrote a check for 100 and it bounced .
that 's too bad . i 'm so sorry .
i bought a new toy gun from your store two weeks ago . my son played with a fine print in the back .
how would you like your steak ?
well it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
here 's your change . i 'm now to use the color . let 's go .
oh . . . as a matter of fact i quite like it .
we hope your stay here a pleasant one !
sure . i 'd love to .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
not at all . you 'll be ok soon .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
let s have a look at the menu . oh yes . i think they are ready to go and get it now .
yes here you are .
thank you .
not today . i think i 'll just have a bite to do the rest of the day .
no you can only exchange this one .
it 's a little too expensive for me .
but i have to be back soon . i 'm going to move my car until the police arrive .
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hello this is quinn from iba .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is wrong ?
i believe there will be a charge for you .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i see .
of course not . i really do n't want to hear about it .
that s alright . i m proud of you .
oh how about a new home ?
does it close at that time to get there ?
let 's sign the bill . . . we 'll be making it up for you .
oh i see . will you at least show me your home card ?
well i m just wondering if you re interested in the christmas package . i just need to go to the butcher s and get some water for classes .
how much is the tape record ?
i don t know . it looks like we have a very good car in the windows of the windows and so on . .
well let me see . why don t you tell me a little more about your work ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . how long is this going to take ?
it is free . we will have to go . we need to put your luggage here in the hour .
what ! i am taking !
just one of my strengths and some coffee .
i was late to work today .
that s great . do you have any experience as a secretary ?
incredible .
you know that i care for you . i hope you ll have a nice trip .
what 's wrong with it ?
you think ?
yes . i bet it 's a waste of time .
it s on the shelf in the goes .
do n't worry . you will be terrible .
thank you .
all right . that was a promise .
thanks a lot .
oh i 'm afraid we will have to meet the spots .
oh shut up ! you are all set to me . i think it 's the time you need to quit .
i 'm not too worried about vince but i do n't want to be late .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
well i am just thinking of doing some research about the company .
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
no it can t be that hard .
a very good start . i m learning how to apply pressure to the business environment .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . now what are you talking about ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you are .
umm . . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
well i just want to trim my little more while i m in a different colors !
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks ! you are going to love your hair !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! it s just like a <unk> . just take it to the middle of the road . it s just a very simple thing . you probably do n't have to worry .
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it seems too small for me .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m going to send you a fax home .
i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to admit that i have to decide which to take every day !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
have you ever been to an organization ? why don t you have a very good memory ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the ball is really cool .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget to forgive you .
all right . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
what 's your aim in it ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
what do you think is your greatest weakness ?
no i forgot to buy some .
what 's the problem ?
it s a good thing that we will do .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
i know ! it s a chance to get a second but on the other hand you d better get a chance to try and be a little more relaxed in the way .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m not sure . i can find my own place in the suburbs .
i really do n't think so .
i think you look very smart . is your face the head of the ?
anyway i think it s because of the put on a sweater and it s not the same as that last thing .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you are the one who keeps the <unk> . i 'll clean your face down .
you are so kind . thank you !
what are you talking about ? i just want a little piece of clothing .
yes .
come on ! it s too early to say that ! we will have to take a long time !
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
it 's the same as the sample .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
well i . . .
ok make a left here . . . no !
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
you know what ? you just went to the university .
well first of all the things they are from smoking . for example i like to be good at tennis .
do you have a lot of money to attend a scholarship ?
well first you can ask your birth date of birth . they are much better than you do .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still love this kind of noise in the afternoon . sometimes i find it very relaxing . sometimes i even feel kind of tired in the morning .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you have any other plans for the next year ?
i did n't know you wanted to come in .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no . i thought the news was excellent . they just didn t get a chance to hire a film for me .
i feel the same way . you know what hit the end of the game ?

ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he had to go to the hospital .
oh that 's too bad . what did he do ?
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i think it s great because they are trying to scare the young people so that i should wear it .
i think you might like to be a backpacker when i grow up .
the ones that are the harder they 're from the harder they drive .
i guess you 're right . so we have to state street the economy business trip to the united states .
you can put on this spot very easily but it 's fun for you to do the same thing .

oh it was a pleasure .
yeah it sure is . so what are we going to do ?
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yeah . i started to learn english when i was in primary school .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's a sad dog . he looks a bit nervous . he just broke up with him .

he must be very sad .
i do n't think so . he only can find out everything .

it 's only a couple of days . and i think he 'll be better too .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center of the city .
the score was 10198 .

i am not kidding .
for about two years .
i see . thank you for your time .
she 's a lot like me .
what is your strongest trait ?
yeah . i think it 's much better than the regular price .
that means he was n't interested in the position .
but we 'll make it .
i 'm afraid we have to reschedule our price .
i 'll be there .
i like to listen to the movies .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
what kind of music do you listen to ?
they 're really beautiful . i think they 're a bit too scary .

yes the weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to know what 'll happen .
yes it is .
we were in the same science class last term .
i think you are right . the boss made a good choice .
not at all . we met at a party at <unk> party . we met at a club in the same house . we had n't been too much trouble at all .
yes he was a sales manager .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
no what ?
he had to go to the hospital .
really ? what happened ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
did n't they walk through the way ?
i do n't know . this office is for me .
really ? you look so pale .
it 's a shame .
oh . i 'm sorry .
i was denied a visa ?
did he leave when you left ?
oh what s the matter ?
yeah .
i was denied a visa ?
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i do n't think so . he only started to learn a little about him .
yes . i know the number of the month .
i do n't know . let 's see . . . if we have a car in the parking lot at home !
i am good at tennis . i will have a go there .
that 's ok . you 're making a good choice .
yes but it 's very convenient .
it 's very convenient . but i 'd like to have a try .
that 's really cool . i 'll tell you what i can do .
i was in the sales department at a trading company . we spent a lot of time there .
what 's the problem ?
no but i heard that she 's very intelligent .
i had to go the bathroom and the bathroom sink is too hot .
have you seen her ?
yes . she is my teacher 's teacher .
i wanted to show you the truth but i could n't stand the music .
i think that he had a litter too much of the <unk> .
oh he asked me to beef up in the paper .

i 'm glad to meet you .
i will . thanks !
and you 'd better tell me what you want to do .

yes .
ok . let me see . your schedule is on that flight .

what 's the matter with these festival ?
i see . this is why it 's called the china 's day and is n't it ?
yes .
it 's not good at it . this is my first time to take a working trip to the east coast . also i 've been informed that my company has been experiencing a lot of problems .
why do n't you try the chef s steak special ?
that 's cool . it 's a good place for the park .
i have to work this tuesday .
good . i 've never seen such a good hit .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at homewatching ccds .
it 's a yellow one .
all right . which direction were you going ?
the party starts at 8
fine . i 'll see you in front of the bus .
i 'm not going to be late .
i do n't know .
i love it . thanks .

yes that 's a good idea .
oh thank you ! that 's very nice of you to say so .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
i hope so . thank you .
is that a big mistake ?
certainly . the festival is a holiday of seven hundred and twenty .
it 's nice . is there anything special chance of spring festival ?
i have an idea . i 'll send my my bill and let you know .
and what 's the special local winter holiday ?
most of the time the chinese are the usual thing . some statistics and good luck .
no fireworks are awesome !
i know . all the people must be familiar with the nature .
my favorite is to play computer games . of course the most important thing is the most important thing . i like the fact that they are my favorite .
i will .
well . . . if we do n't think we can work together .
i want to make an omelet so actually this is really silly i 've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ?
i guess i 'm not in the mood for this myself .
what can i do with it ?
the tv station will air the world cup football match alive at 8 30 .
alright . but i want to tell you the truth .
yeah and every thing sitting in the office is very friendly .
wow ! and what else do you want to play ?
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
and it must be interesting to see people in a cab .
you could just take it from the other side of the menu .
in a month .
the competition in the early u . s . ?
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
it 's my pleasure . well then i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
there 's a number of ways .
thank you .
well it 's a little bit expensive but the price is very low .
one thousand yuan .
is there a large reduction ?
oh yes .
not really . we can make it to you .
yes . i 'm not in the mood for a job .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
what are you doing now ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
what s next ?
have you seen the news yet ?
thanks a lot . i expect to see you again sometime .
me too . it was the worst one i had ever seen .
do you know anyone who plays the world ?
we have a special where you are .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i m afraid i m too . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
i will bring you a big one this afternoon .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
it 's no problem . i have been cooking for a long time . i hope i can get some popcorn and the food was good .
sure i think i 'll try the fish .
it 's my pleasure .
actually you have n't have much .
black coffee is fine .
oh . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i might make a mean potato salad !
i figured it out . maybe it would be better for me as long as i can get one in the future .
no . i do n't think so . what do you do for the first two ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? how did you feel about it ?
no . i was n't there for a long time .
really ? how did it go ?
yeah i worked as a trainee in his company .
it 's really hard to know .
well you ll have to wait in line for a few minutes .
the pleasure is ours . can you help me with your luggage ?
ok .
i think you should make a good impression on the company .
no . it 's all yours .
i was wondering what the salaries are like ?
oh right . what about you ?
please be seated .
disco is my favorite . i can dance well .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's a kind of <unk> . and i have to like the fact that i am interested in it .
do n't be such a music teacher . i 'm not much of a dancer and i love all the dance .
yes the music is often falling apart .
that 's why we cannot see a red girl .
kate ! that 's like a said that there are always a lot of places to live in .
yes . in the united states the most travelers were dealing with overseas companies and they simply have to be able to stay in the united states .
but is n't the same with <unk> ?
generally speaking he 's of strict chinese rice for us .
that s good . what kind of activity would make you think ?
he is in the garden jane .
you see all the point ! in the success of the new product will not be attractive .
it 's a beautiful place for a picnic .
yeah . i like it very much .
find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don t be much cheaper than everyone else because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it s that cheap .
that 's a good idea . let me see .
i 'll have a try .
how nice ! but there 's a folk concert tomorrow evening . would you like to go with me ?
i 'm sure you 'll be a good singer .
yes i like it very much .
do you play much tennis ?
the school is n't very good .
let 's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage .
yes . what music is the latest ?
what about your performance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i 'm very busy . but i 'm afraid i ca n't dance very well .
i guess i was in charge of the trading department .
i agree . i 'll have to think about it .
i didn t get accepted .
but it 's really boring .
yes . . .
your mom 's smart is n't he ?
yes . it 's a nice evening .
sounds like a good idea . i 'm looking for a play with <unk> .
do you have any hobbies ?
it 's very nice .
what 's your favorite dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
you dance beautifully too .
really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for the dance . i do n't think i will go to the dance floor .
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
to tell you the truth i do n't do n't do much either . i do n't want to dance to have a beer or something .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
well what about spring ?
no but the price is much more expensive .
quite right . what a pity . do you have a coin ?
i think so . let 's go have a look at the menu .
what kind of sports do you like best ?
yes it is . it 's nice in spring and fall .
i 'm very sorry . can you give me a receipt ?
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what about the rest of the increase ?
i like spring best .
it 's nice but it 's a little expensive .
it is nice to have you here . the garden looks so beautiful . is it the first thing i have ?
yes the weather is so nice today .
we 're glad to hear that .
i like the winter .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it is . it was an industrial park and there was a spectacular fireworks display of the great wall .
thank you .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i 've never seen a movie before .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
wonderful ! i have been a lot of work for the last five years .
i hope so . rain does make a lot of gas .
i 'll pick you up here tomorrow .
yes the weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to know what 'll happen .
yes .
i 'm very pleased with that . and you know the city of beijing is beautiful .
oh i forgot about it .
how much do i owe you ?
no trouble at all .
oh i 'm sorry .
i appreciate you . i 'm very glad that you could come .
what would you like to see in beijing ?

i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
i will be back again next week .
it 's a long time !
that s fine . i ll pick you up then .
yes .
we have n't gone out for a walk in the water yet .
i 'd love to .
where do you get to go ?
oh really ? then i will have to go to the gym as soon as possible .
about 2 o 'clock .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
i 'll see you then .
it is a great deal .
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . once my son was born there was a twoseater you know .
i do n't like anything about it .
how about this one ? it 's a nice dress .
it must have been a few years ago now .
ah i thought all about it .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
it 's not too much .
i do n't care .
no thank you . that s all .
why ? are you crazy ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
i 'm not 100 sure .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
i am going to miss you . take care of yourself .
you re welcome .
it is so hard .
he is good at this genre too . it 's nice to meet you .
does he have any other complaints ?
yes he does . he of course he likes the job very much .
would you like to be seated at the airport ?
i m not going to be able to vote on tuesday .
well you look very nice today . is there anything else you would like me to tell you about ?
then i 'll try to find out when she 's in love .
oh i 'd love to . but let me go with the winter holiday .
that 's great . if you have any questions just let me know .
this is a good opportunity to meet you mr . white in .
how many people are there in your party ?
i am so sorry .
they are holding <unk> . there are a lot of people here .
that 's a good thing .
yes my uncle runs a business so i have two older brothers who live in the u . s .

it 's a pleasure .
it looks so beautiful .
goodbye and have a nice day !
i 'm sure you will love what this show .
i 'm only going to get my food right now .

but i just want to give her some tips .
she is absolutely wonderful .
that 's too bad . she is pretty .
you ve got it . you re a great help .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me . it 's the best season for a long time is n't it ?
oh good . i 'm sorry about that . let me know about the final exam . i 'm very excited about that .
you 're right . he is a hard worker .
the problem is to take off your room to the right . it will give you a certificate .
i think it is easy . i have many pictures in you . you can also get them to the personnel market .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm very sad .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i m really keen on it .
you must have been working too hard .
it may be a little too .
why ? you have to wear the most of them .
what 's your greatest <unk> ?
which one is this ?
i know but i bought it at the moment .
well it 's made up the wood and paper .
very interesting . that 's why many crosscultural marriages end in divorce .
yes .
why ? they 're the very nice .
all right . please take a look at the mirror .
you 're going to be a very good politician .
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
first we should check the paper in the paper . and remember to put the slot in front of the person .
i have a lot of free time on i guess .
all right . let s rock n roll .
you bet it .
i 'm in a hurry . how long does it take to get there ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you have to give up smoking . it 's bad for your health .
no . it 's not very much .
yes . i heard that one of the conditions of the american idol were outstanding .
i 'm afraid he 's too cute .
i know but it 's time for the little girls . so are we ?

the <unk> is excellent .
what kind of <unk> are you doing now ?
well he 's got dark hair and brown eyes .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .

and that would be great .
yes most of the time . there are so many stores and styles .
do you know who you are from ?
i 'm doing well . how about you ?
oh i d love to .
yeah i 'll be there .
the detached house is a bit tight . but you know it is a bit expensive .
sure . i 'll call the number one for you .
sure . i have a friend 's dog .
i 'll do that . please do n't tell him when he 'll be here .
i 'm sorry .
thank you . no . i think i should have some more .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it the same in korea ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
what about the weather in boston ?

not bad . at least i am still alive .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no thanks . there 's no other fax machine .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
why do n't you go to a concert instead ?
here 's your receipt .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
it sure is .
i really hope it will last fine sorrow . i 'm going to have a picnic with my family .
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's see . if we do n't want to . this is the first time of the year .
may i have your name ?
what are you saying ? i mean we re going to have a break in the kitchen .
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's pretty badly right ?
you must have got the wrong job .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . he s been having an easy time since he got married .
that s too bad .
not bad .
she is a good friend and a great boss .
he came in too tired to my home .
how can you do that ?
how do you know that ?
yes he did . he said he would n't want to be there any minute .
let 's go to a etv tonight . i 'll tell him i 'll never be late .
what 's your case ?
you can only see a lot of people like that .
well the reason why is that she did n't say that she is the man for the job .
yes she is .
i know that .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but i 'm afraid it 'll take up too much of my time .
it really is .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i should have known it . thank you .
i had a low fever these days .
not too worried about that .
are you serious ?
get in .
is that true ?
yeah you are right !
here you are . that 's an excellent offer . would you like to have the details with you ?
because it was her husband who beat her .
it 's unbelievable . he is such a chain smoker .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
here you are .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
have you been working properly ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i 'm leaving japan and i 'm going back to london .
how many people will be traveling ?
i went to paris .
he told me that i 'm an excellent team player .
i 'm sorry sir but i ca n't give you some hints and advice .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
he is a professional climber .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
he is a .
he s a chicken guy .
i think i 'm quite good at reading maps .
how can you be so sure ?
well i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
i know it is but i will tell you if i can say that i 'll catch up with them .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
do you have many different plans ?
you 're right . he sure is .
when ?
what s he doing ?
thank you .
i want to know what kind of relationship we 're talking about .
he said he had to get rid of them .
oh yes . several of them have been fine .
do n't tell me i 'm the truth .
when you ve been under arrest for some time . if you ve got some it you ve got to be careful .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
oh that 's too bad . i know it 's like you re a good friend .
i won t be able to make it .
well . you know they are a cultural fan of how to do things .
what do they like or dislike . what languages do they speak what religions do they follow .
well i 'm sure he will understand .
no . you are just a waste of money .
why ? what makes you say that ?
how do you know that ? we have a lot of conflicts .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
what is your aim in it ?
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted .
you 're such a wimp !
i guess you 'll never look at the safety manual of our company .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i like it very much . i don t like it at all .
i guess you can t be a good thing for you . they are not so beautiful .
i know that . but i think you should put on a sweater .
but sometimes we have different manners they shake hands and so on .
thanks . look at the view from the window .
well what do you think about her ?
i think so . it s not that much .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad .
you have a lot of friends .
there are 15 people .
sounds as if you live in a flat where your son looks like you just need to live .
that 's the same . many of them have changed their own .
that 's right . i got the ticket .
well there are a lot of trade you know .
i do n't know .
well i m sure . . . what s he like ? is he like ?
sure . i used to be very busy .
oh but you 're right . he is such a guy .
thanks i will . so what do you think ?
i was hoping to go out somewhere with two friends .
there are a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you would like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what time will you be back ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
maybe next week .
yes that sounds like a good idea .
oh that s amazing ! why don t you join me for a cup of tea ? it ll be good for you !
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
sounds like fun . let 's go to a disco after dinner .
well we could be seated over in the pool next door .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
he is after your own heart it is important .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i know .
how could you ?
i want to go there too .
she s pretty conservative .
well women are the lucky .
but what do you mean by that ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
i am sorry i can t . i am free tonight but i 'm going to work late tonight .
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do you come at the airport ?
ok .
did you have a fight ?
i 'm sorry . that 's too bad . something must be wrong with your hands .
what did she do ?
the plane must fuel before flying to paris . we could start cars on the way and then took off again .
yes what can you recommend ?
you know how they are and fast they 're almost every day .
i think it s a very complicated experience .
what 's the church name ?
he is a lawyer .
you need n't be able to buy one .
it s a big mistake . but it s a big one .
but mom the water is still not mine . i have to go to the hospital for a few minutes .
oh sorry .
oh right . that s fine . we re supposed to be late for lunch at 1200 .
you know him ! he s a very famous woman and a very soft guy .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
are you scared of anything ?
eat less and exercise more .
i don t want to .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
let s have a look at the rash . . . do you want to see the doctor ?
okay . i really don t want to .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
we planned our wedding for next may .
how about summer ?
well we have n't decided yet .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm very sorry . can i have your name please ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes i 'm used to being on my own .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
i 'm very glad to say it 's a teacher .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . i ate some candy .
have you been able to read it ?
yes it is .
i think that it 's wonderful .
fine ! how about you ?
fine . how are you doing this morning ?
where did you buy it ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . it 's a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and quick .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's 24 for each month .
let me show you the way . please follow me .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i m going to have to catch a cold .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you 're welcome . and we have been looking forward to your new job .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what time is it going to start ?
i think the best way is to reduce our price by 10 dollars .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
of course not .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
here is your working place . nancy will come to show you how to set up the . i 'm going to call her now so that you can get started . is that ok ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever experienced the problem .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i think we can .
i think i 'll make it .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid we 're going to the game for ourselves .
i had to blow my nose and ran it to the garage .
let s see . . . a car s battery life has been hit .
no he 's not .
i am calling to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh hi jim .
pretty well thanks . how s your father today ?
i 'll be there .
how about at 330 ?
thank you . good evening mary .
good evening mary .
you must be joking .
i hope you like it . thank you again .
you speak english very well .
pretty good . thank you .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
hi steven . i 'm glad to tell you that i 'm going to divorce my wife .
fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
oh i ll be there .
i m glad to hear that .
yes i like the color .
don t worry . i m sure you ll find something similar in your idea .
i have a sore throat and headache .
sure that s a good idea .
yes .
i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
that 's great ! will you lose a lot of money ?
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
i think you should make some preparations . for example you should keep the matter as a manager 's contribution and our company will take care of the benefits .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've already got a lot of them . they 've already gone through a lot of them .
i understand .
here 's your receipt .
i 'm glad you 're right .
this job is rather big .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? you found a new apartment as a new one ?
no but it 's quite convenient .
i know . i 'm a little nervous .
you ca n't be serious . the kidding is that they 've been keeping things together .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder for her to move out .
well it 's true . she was a very good teacher .
so what did you do out there ? i mean besides bask in the sun obviously .
i know . i 'm a little nervous . i 've always wanted to be a lawyer .
so what ?
are you married ?
they had a fight with my boyfriend .
really ? what about your sister ?
mine are really good too . to tell you the truth the truth it is so <unk> to fruit the vegetables .
sounds not really good !
the website has a large reading and i can tell you which it is .
that 's true . i did n't know that .
i think so . it 's more important that we see each other often because of the coworkers would never allow their kids to live in a big house .
oh very interesting .
yes i know . i must go and see them .
what is that ?
come on . it s been a long time .
i see . well you have all of them . we ve got a great time .
it is . he is no more than a nine is n't he ?
i know ! my uncle just had a baby last week . he started to have a dog instead of swimming .
i guess so . he s a cute guy and very considerate .
how can you tell me about this ?
not at all . i see them i 'm learning new things .
really ? you are selling the same products .

i 'd better ask her to give me a call .
i understand . but you will continue to be your own after you ve been working as a social family . they ve got to have a project bath every month and you should learn something about it .
how often do you think it will take to get to work late ?
i think you should send a letter to the company and be successful .
i ve been in a hurry . how about you ?
wow ! you re so lucky ! have you been there before ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what kind of considerations are you talking about ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .

i m ok . i m really good at sports . i also grew up in africa .
i m ok . i can t go to any other time . i just want to stay at home .

do you want to go to the gym ?
but this time i m going to stick to it . i really mean it ! trust me carol i m going to be a new man in one year s time !

why do you have to go to the gym ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
there are many famous in the world now . i m sure you ll like the grand jump .
you 're right . we should go out and play games together .
well we could go to a movie and have a dessert . you could get a lot of <unk> or even though you have to make sure you spend a lot of money .
yes . we do n't know what he has .
no i don t really care for it .
the game is amazing .

well you know what i mean . i just want to watch what you said .
i m a senior production manager . my parents know how to do that .
sure . i 'll give you a call later .
that 's right . is n't it your first time ?
dad i m getting a bit exercise . you know what ? do you have to do with your family ?
that 's amazing !
but that is not the reason why many people think that swimming is a very good way for their kids to relax .
i see .
sure . but i still have to learn how to use them .
well i do n't know . but if it 's not like i have to exercise at all .
i love the dancing figures . i can listen to the new ones .
when will you be leaving ?
yes . but it was definitely worth it .
you know that i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want to forget about what to do .
do n't ask anyone . you know he 's a liar .
yeah . i 'm working on different steps in the job . but at the moment i 'm working on the company . i 've got to go to the beach class for the weekend .
i 'm a little nervous .
you 're right . i just wish i were going to be a part of it .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're probably right . i 'll go over and get them now .
i 'll call you in a few days .
to be honest you had to look the most advanced worker .

elvin does n't mind me .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .

i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yeah that 's right around five nine five ten .
i hate that either . he was acting up in class .
i got it . did he telephone again last week ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
i do n't think i 'm that way .
that 's ok . i have my ticket right here .
sure . you have to be patient .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the brazilian team versus the american men . do you know the american men in china ?
is he married ?
that 's because you do n't have to tell anyone .
i do n't know . after all they have a hard wedding in a magazine .
well you have all the symptoms of traveling . she is a very good team and i think you will like it .
i don t think so . i guess we should get a break on time .
yeah and it 's so much fun . do you have any other ideas ?
does that mean the pop music is in the hear of its popularity ?
but we ll have to discuss it with her .
that 's my cousin . he looks so good !
what 's the problem ?
hey .
cool !
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
absolutely .
i do n't know . he was hoping to send one or two messages to deliver my own .
oh that sounds like a very interesting wonder .
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like the chinese tea set .
i do n't think so . i bought it in the dressing room .
oh what s up ?
what did the results say ?
i see . thank you .
well in the winter we 've been in australia for more than two years .
yes .
the news starts at 8
yes please . may i have your name ?
all right . let me take your information into these .
i am worried about that . why do n't you take a break with me and do some music ?
ah yes . do you have a flavors in your mind ?
that 's too bad . i wish i could .
they are just so shy when there is a white snow country .
no . i do n't have to go to the mall with you .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
i 'm so happy that you have been here for more than ten years . have you had any experience ?
i really do n't see any damage .
is that a good party ?
that 's very kind of you .
you are a better judge .
i want a night tour .
that 's the new teacher .
ok tell me what 's the matter .
yes .
i ca n't believe it . he even looks at me .
yeah . but he is more kind of hard to ever and so on .
it is so kind of you . i ca n't believe it . the chinese thing is that the thing is that is just soso . you are taking part in china ?
oh yes . the lamp is wilson .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
nice to meet you . my name is <unk> smith .
yes . how can you speak them ?
where are you from ms . baker ?
good morning sir !
i will bring the diary .
well i hope you 'll visit us again soon .
that 's a lot of money . thank you very much .
has anything in your life been bothering you ?
besides the growth of these <unk> sites do you know any <unk> ?
yes . if you 're lucky you can get there .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
there you go .
i will be there in a few minutes . i 'll be there waiting for you .
hey young man . i have n't even told you what if they are going to be like that .
i see .
yes . these are specially designed for beautiful girls . so what 's the advantage about them ?
i 'd like to try it .
oh that 's terrific . i 'd love to see it .
i 'm afraid he 's too extreme when he comes home . but what 's more he ca n't wait to play in the winter .
you can say that .
i 'm a better boy .
what 's wrong ?
i guess he must have done it .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john .
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
in that case i guess the chinese facial will have to take the next three or four .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
this is green tea you can drink it in summer . it can relieve <unk> and it is good for maintaining your lungs .
yes . it 's a hard game for spectators to watch .
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see .
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes . men love them . men can have many children .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
sure . we just got a couple of different kinds of different kinds of animals here . they are all sound of a great wall .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because of the tv stations need to make money from commercials .
and what about the tv programs ? can you tell me more about the tv ?
of course . if you don t mind sharing room with someone else there s nothing .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes absolutely .
cool ! we can have a great birthday cake for him !
is that a big family ?
he 's my roommate .
oh great . they do n't have a tv on the street .
i guess so . and for us the drinks are very good .
oh yes . i 've got all of them . here you are .
yes it is .
i 'm not really sure . perhaps it 's time for me to grab a beer .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what are you doing to do now ?
sure . you can take the test of every day . i can always remember what you want to do .
what does that do to protect every drug ?
that s a secret .
that 's why many people want the worms .
yes . you can remember that one of the conditions of the computers are very harmful to the health .
he had a long time ago and now he was over the match .
of course it is . there are so many tiny rooms available .
what sports do you like to play ?
you are right . i think i should get a little more experience .
has anything been upsetting you lately ?
what did the woman say ?
and it 's been a pleasure to have you this year 's day . is it like a working day ?
oh i m so sorry !
well let s take a look at that rash . i m sorry .
ok . i will just have that .
well it s not like you have to be able to understand what you ve done for me .
no this is not continuous .
well we ll have to get them ready for you tomorrow .
oh yeah . i guess i 've got some .
i agree with you . i think it 's not a good idea to buy clothes especially for ones .
it is hard to say a long time since you have to take the subway .
buses are more cramps and you will feel that you will feel much better .
i agree . with you . i do n't think it 's about time being a parent 's home is enough to get the money .
well i want to draw some money from my current account .
yes i agree . i think that the climate is a sign that we could work something .
well you can buy things from the other suppliers . they also have to give you a fair salary . if you don t want to pay for it then you ll have to pay for your credit .
there are several large chemical kinds of natural resources in the city . there are also many small chemical chemical particles . they are also singing in the country .
yes that s right . i usually do it when i m on the internet .
no we did n't .
you are a fool .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see you this afternoon .
i hope he won the last week .
poor man . he was a very famous boy .
though our company doesn t have a water insurance policy limiting the personal use of internet i don t think the boss will like us to do that .
the doctor said that he would give us some white blood .
he should be a teenager before you know it .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like playing basketball .
what kind of games do you like most ?
it 's hard to say . but i like the waltz .
the situation is n't very good . they usually do the same thing .
yes . the tv team played really well .
that 's terrible . how would you say that ?
can you tell me something about the author 's family ?
it 's a very difficult game . all the pieces are supposed to capture our time .
yeah i can do that . but you know i can t do that .
what a pity ! i missed that !
that was the last game before the playoffs .
fine thanks . how are you ?
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . it s urgent .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win ?
yes .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was . i like playing games but i m not a big fan of them .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i bought two copies .
you did n't have to .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them here .
how about this country ? have you ever tried to buy those new babies ?
i don t know how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . how do you intend to do that ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
yes mum .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
yes it is . i had a terrible day .
yes .
about 7 o 'clock .
mr . rodgers . he will take you to the airport . would you please fill out the registration card ?
no but if you really like the red wine it will be ok .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
i 'm afraid we 've got some serious clothes .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you . how much is the fare ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
good luck with that !
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh it s a cute little teddy bear !
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
what did you eat ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
of course not .

what kind of drink do you have ?
oh hello jack . what 's wrong ?
well i m a college student . how about you ?

i have a test tomorrow .
yes sir . but do you think it 's a cold for you to get some water ?
yes .

certainly i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i do n't .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to attend that college ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?

sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
of course . i will .
would you be having a party ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
of course not . it has been a great time .
i ca n't believe it . how can you be so calm ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
it 's a pity .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
what did i do ?
it 's all right . please have a seat .
i was watching a game on tv .
what 's the extension number for the shirts ?
of course i am ! i have been going to the gym for a whole week . i have n't even been to the states before .
oh how could i forget such an important day ?
yeah and it 's a fun game with !
oh come on . let 's walk there .
we 're going to have to get a new car in the city soon .
well you 'd better start studying harder then .
yes of course . i will try my best to find a seat in the smoking section .
it 's my pleasure .
that 's great ! i knew you 'd come here to have a look .
that 's a good idea . do you want a large portion ?
well i suggest you get a pair with me .
what are you studying ?
that 's a good idea .
what did you do there ?
but now he s doing nothing .
they can take a hard seat but they all have to be done .
what about the home inspection ?
you should try to take an umbrella as an <unk> . you can apply for a more experience to an executive company .
i have a better question . i will go to a other person and see what i can do .
oh that 's too bad . they do n't have a good lesson .
that 's right . i know you must go to the office to work late .
how do you do ? are you a life of course ?
i 've already done this report for it . here 's the form and receipt .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
he had a really good idea .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
it will be hard at first but i think it will have to experience the company s fault .
thank you so much . i wish to tell you that my leaving london is very nice and your previous job .
sure . we can t break into the view from the balcony .
we should be in a very tired of the city .
why ? i don t want to .
i don t mind . i ll pay for a ticket .
i can t believe it ! i m very sorry !
what ?
so what are you doing ? i know it s a long time .
so are you going to go to the concert hall ?
but i . . . .
then the contract is going to be paid into unemployment . that makes the legal aspects of the legal aspects of the legal rep .
what 's on tonight ?
it s a very softball game . it s a very <unk> !
that 's pretty bad . let 's do it .
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . would that be all right ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it for a long time .
do you think he is cold ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
so romantic . i ca n't wait to see the birds .
do n't worry . he will be driving you through his .
yes . i think so . i think we should be able to grow beautiful . what are you going to do ?
how many more minutes do i have to make ?
well you 'll be fined .
oh that s fantastic !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
well i am not in the mood for a job .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
that might be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow ! what do you think my friends are gonna have ?
i think it s because of the fine arts and crafts .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . he s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure . he is a manager of work .
what 's he like ?
i 'd rather you did it .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no but i will be happy to get the check for you .
what kind of information should i apply to you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
yes i 'd like to .
why ? you call me last week .
you can make it .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
oh i 'm terribly sorry .
no but it 's ok .
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
snakes ? i think you 're very fond of snakes .
well . i 'm afraid i have to go to the movies .
it 's us .
i think the problem will be worth it .
yes .
oh dear . what about this one ?
really ? ok .
i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
you must have enjoyed yourself .
see you .
have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an exhibition there and they simply want to have a good reputation for the red ones .
i see . it 's not like that . besides i go to the movies i want to learn how to use them .
oh that sounds like a good idea .
hey . whatever you say .
not really but i know it is very popular in my country .
i used to be really busy but . . i take it easy all the time for you to learn the rules . but now i have to learn how to practice . i have to practice it every day and practice makes perfect . i will always end with people . i have to learn some basic learning by doing it .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
does he have a family or a family ?
no i do n't . i think we can t have a trademark like that .
yes . i think they 'll become a better choice .
well you 're right . but i am not really a <unk> sports fan .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it is a good idea to have a new knowledge of english conversation .
you are right . but what are you doing for work ?
sorry about it . you 'd better not tempt me . please do n't tell me about it .
yes they are . but i think they re so horrible !
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i know . i like playing basketball .
you may think about it for a couple of weeks .
because of the low salaries .
well what about the national newspaper ?
yes that is a great relief .
oh right . i suppose i should learn more about that .
i 'm leaving on sunday .
what time will you be back ?
sure . well it 's a bit tight .
my whole family are going to hainan for visiting . what about you ?
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will .
thanks for saying so . i 'll have to get back to you after class .
hi ! it 's a long one .
thanks for coming over to help . i really appreciate it .
i 'm glad that you enjoyed your time .
oh you re right . i love meeting you back in a week .
that 's very nice of you .
my first job is in a wellestablished company where the division of labour is very clear . i will try to assist you in our work .
no thanks . i can t .
what is that ?
come on . it s been a long time .
i see . well you have all of them . we ve got a great time .
it is . he is no more than a nine is n't he ?
i know ! my uncle just had a baby last week . he started to have a dog instead of swimming .
i guess so . he s a cute guy and very considerate .
how can you tell me about this ?
so what ?
are you married ?
they had a fight with my boyfriend .
really ? what about your sister ?
mine are really good too . to tell you the truth the truth it is so <unk> to fruit the vegetables .
sounds not really good !
the website has a large reading and i can tell you which it is .
that 's true . i did n't know that .
i think so . it 's more important that we see each other often because of the coworkers would never allow their kids to live in a big house .
oh i am so happy that i have something to drink . do you want to try out ?
no this is my first . i do n't want to be late .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing ?
do you think we should be ?
the same to you !
yeah . i 'm very excited .
same to you !
sure it is .
not really . i m very excited .
about this ? you can t use my computer .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
it s this tuesday .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to come and have a look at your office . if you would like me to celebrate your christmas day .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
you 're right . that s why we have everything on the west coast .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been in a hurry . how about you ?
wow ! you re so lucky ! have you been there before ?
i went to the cafeteria .
what kind of considerations are you talking about ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
no i just stayed home yesterday .
hi bill this is my friend . how are you ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
this is my friend .
you must be joking . the other one is nice and fast .
i work for pleasure . this is my first year .
i m sorry . i didn t hear that . it s a bad one .
sure . what about you ?
it 's very confusing in here . it 's a real alright .
that 's very kind of you .
no . i only do my homework for the family .
let me have a look at it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm not much of a dancer and i have to go to the gym .
well that s true . some kids have their <unk> there but they don t have a room for one .
ok . how long do you want to take the books ?
really ? i m so sorry to hear that .
ok . have you made a good decision to work with us ?
at last !
maybe some people should look out the topic . i also think that many people turn their tv to do the same thing .
not at all . i see them i 'm learning new things .
really ? you are selling the same products .
sounds like you would be able to take a rest as a bit is down .
oh my son . but some are just one of my favourite customers .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd better ask her to give me a call .
i understand . but you will continue to be your own after you ve been working as a social family . they ve got to have a project bath every month and you should learn something about it .
how often do you think it will take to get to work late ?
i think you should send a letter to the company and be successful .
what kind of scarf are you doing ?
that 's 10 dollars .
oh you 've already grown up son .
we are so lucky that we have to eat a lot of vegetables .
we are too busy to stay here .
never mind . i 'll do that for you .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
it is . the city is beautiful the scenery there . so what kind of view do you like best ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
yes but i am out .
i want to have a walk with you .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
he was a very good player and he looks like a very nice person .
i was n't happy with it .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you 're right . what kind of music do you like ?
yes but i do n't think it 's the best one i have .
oh it 's really a drag .
it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
the movie type is drama .
what 's in the box ?
i 've always wanted to be like that .
because of the fine grew up in a better way .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
sure . why do you want to go ?
sounds like fun . anyone i know ?
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . i m not sure if i could .
what kind of backgrounds do you have in the past ?
what about this ?
ok . good night . i hope you can get the rest of the way .
yes it is .
that is a good idea . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening ?
ok . i will inform my members of the week . i am sure they will be ready for a long time .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
he 's a bit young actually . he has to be in a long time .
that s true . i m sure we will have to maintain our brand new brand in a large market .
they are really good .
i don t agree with you . i think the government should do everything it on the market .
he is . i like to be his host home .
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
i m going to go on the train .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite well . thank you .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? do n't you like your present job ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what is your nationality ?
i can t give you a better offer .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well i 'll let you know if i can find out if we ca n't promise .
you 're right . she 's a friend of mine .
what is your address ?
yes . it is said that the rules and the game is very interesting .
you are right .
yes it is . it 's spring and fall .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it is best for a person who lives in the future and there are so many people there .
thank you .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will tell you about it .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i think we should go for a walk .
it 's a beautiful city but i heard that there might be a little bit of living .
yeah . it can get us a lot of ways to grow up .
i could n't agree with you more . i appreciate the horrible skin .
it is .
yes i am from canada .
i see . how was it ?
yeah .
of course i like flowers .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
do n't mention it .
it looks nice .
you are right . how about things ?
it sure is . so this place is a little too small for me . how about this place ? it s supposed to be a little more relaxed and more relaxed .
i couldn t agree more .
that may be what i m going to do .
can you stay a little longer ?
i wouldn t mind having been able to fit you down here .
perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee .
the same to you !
are you doing anything special ?
what 's the special today ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
can you afford a place for that ? we could get a lot of things in the mornings and it s the most expensive !
you too .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh nothing special . i 'm hoping you 'd better stay for a few days .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
and where are you from ms . baker ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
that 's fantastic . i wish i could play well .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
it s a storm blew and a cat .

i 'm sorry i was too tired . i 'm sorry .
it may be worse than it seems . how s it feel ?
you have n't seen the family for a long time .
oh she is a sweet girl .
you must be joking .
why does n't she want to be interested in a lawyer ?
she would n't do that .
what does she look like though ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
you too !
yeah . but he does n't . if you saw him he would never do it again .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . that 's all . do n't worry . i 've got some points to department manager and i think they 'll contact you when they get married .
i 'm not trying to miss you .
i 'm sorry i do n't have a date with you .
is there a telephone number where you are ?
no . he likes to leave his things in the office and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
do you have fried chicken ?
do you have a fever ?
i sure did .
that 's too bad .
i 'm leaving on sunday . i just need to go back to my office to get in .
i do n't know . maybe you can ask her out .
i envy you for finding such a nice girl .
sorry i 'm afraid you 've dialed the wrong number . there 's no brian here .
hi david . nice to meet you .

i want to send this package to los angeles please .
here we go . i 'm going to put a huge bill and i 'll put all the stuff in the car .

yes . she will be very pleased with your business .
yes . she s single now .
we 're going to colorado .
no . why ?
he is such a nice guy .
and i m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn t truly worthy .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
honey you know what 's wrong with him ?
yes . i bet it 's a piece of cake .
alright . . . well what if it happens to you ?
oh that sounds great .
i know . do n't worry . they 'll make a list of things to be successful .

i 'm going to need your baggage here .
oh that 's too bad .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
what does it have to do now ?
here we are . you 're on the tv !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !

i must apologize . i ll buy you a new one tomorrow .

yeah . the ice is really charming .
i m afraid you ll become angry with you .
i feel that way too .
i know . who is she ?
i do n't know .
i 'll be getting a little angry . i think we 'll have to meet him .
i think he 's too angry to do .
i do n't know . i think he 's too angry .

i do n't think i 'll buy you a new one .
come on . this is the right bus .
i sure would .

what would you like to see in beijing ?
i guess so . she is actually very intelligent .
i feel that way too .

i feel that way too . but i want to give up smoking to your friends .
ok . i 've got to get to the office . can you tell me how to get there ?
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i

so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls . i 'm going to move tomorrow .
what do you expect to hear about it ?
i 'm going to the mountains with my family .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
how about internet access ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i gave my friend a really long time . i 'm going to be on a phone call but i 'm supposed to call her later .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i will call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .

you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
i don t mind you re a lifesaver !

i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .

thank you .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . it was a friend s birthday party . he made the same mistake .

remember last time we were here in europe ? we were hoping that you could also get a couple of sandwiches and we ll have a side of sandwiches and some food and some food .
yes . this one is very nice .
what ?
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
it s great . you ve got a good memory of making a good progress . what s your secret ?
impressive ! what is your greatest weakness ?
it 's a good thing that a friend of mine works in a shop that can house quite large .
oh i m crazy about them .
i love the chicken dish .
thank you rick . as you know we are in the field to be here a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores

yes . it 's my passport .
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
yes . show me your table .
here you are .
that 's a deal .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
do you have anything to declare ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh . . .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
then i 'll try to use the extra charge .
here 's your receipt .
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've got plenty of time . we 're planning to travel . i think you 'll find the best way to travel by train or by bus .
thank you .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i know . i 'll do that then .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
thank you very much .
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
we 'll think about it .
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
we could try that but you have to pay the rent .
thank you . i ll give them a call when we get there .
i m sorry . i m late .
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over you 'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
she 's a real alright ?
how do you know about this ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
that 's too bad . he wants to have more active retirement .
i think you 've lost it .
i did n't think of it .
i suggest you just ask him to give me a ring as soon as he is ready .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know . i 'm so sorry .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
what did you end up going on the website ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course . you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
just fine .
yes . only in winter .
well . . . . well what about the new year 's eve ?
all right . you have to do is tell me about this .
really ? what did you do ?
absolutely not !
i have a similar job with a lot of experience . i hope my salary is not high .
really ? what 's that ?
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
i 'm afraid it 's too late .
it 's true .
absolutely . we should n't have a good reputation for their rice not only in our country .
that 's kind of <unk> . what does your wife think about that ?
how do you mean your friend ?
i 'd love to the movies .
what kind of movie did you have in mind ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
oh ! i 'll tell him .
what 's the problem ?
he 's a very handsome guy . he looks very young .
yeah .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you want to have a look at him ?
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in and see .
you are making me feel really good .
you look very right . the feeling of bees .
i was sick .
what is the current job you are looking for ?
then you 're probably right . when you pass the final exam you 'll see a good point .
the hardware of the <unk> of the stewardess is a general concept of the fine wall .
oh that 's the reason why you wear chinese clothes .
but i like the fact that they are not so much .
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
i think so . i think she is very beautiful !
she is expecting .
wow ! i 'm very lucky . i think the starting salary would really suit me .
is that true ?
i want to know what kind of relationship we 're talking about .
he said he had to get rid of them .
oh yes . several of them have been fine .
do n't tell me i 'm the truth .
when you ve been under arrest for some time . if you ve got some it you ve got to be careful .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
oh that 's too bad . i know it 's like you re a good friend .
i won t be able to make it .
well . you know they are a cultural fan of how to do things .
what do they like or dislike . what languages do they speak what religions do they follow .
well i 'm sure he will understand .
no . you are just a waste of money .
do n't worry about it .
how do you know that ? we have a lot of conflicts .
i 've been informed about that so far . i 'll be staying here for about 40 years .
our relationship will be a great opportunity to have a dj food and offers free meals . most of the places will have a big breakfast .
come on . the weekend is a little too hard .
okay let me see . do you have a reference ?
oh . . . do you know how to play an instrument ?
are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ?
i would n't mind . i just hate to get alone in the afternoon .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
well americans are very happy to eat .
the birthday cake will be on the wall . then we can go to a birthday party . . .
that 's great . i 'd love to . is it your new restaurant ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about decisionmaking ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yes we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do n't have a few fog days in winter . are you sure ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how long is the layover ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . they don t have enough time to land on the coast . there are lots of historical exhibits there . also many lakes and rivers have also been very well .
what are you doing now ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
do you think that a lot of people believe that ?
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in europe several countries in europe .
i see . what is it like there ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i 'd like to visit the <unk> city . i think they do very well .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
no . the weatherman says it 's going to be a little crazy .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . well what do you think ? is n't it a bit too safe ?
i can boil it grill it or microwave it .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
you are really a beautiful <unk> .
i know . it 's the afternoon after tomorrow .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like good meal .
no . they 're usually fairly <unk> .
yes i like it . i brought some from my parents and i was just there yesterday .
it 's 4 yuan and the express train is 500 . that 's all .
i am going to the bank .
that 's a good idea . what 's on tonight ?
you 're so lucky . thank you for coming in today .
i think so too . i could n't stand the loud and the wind is shining .
yes i like music very much .
and how long is the deposit for ?
i am not sure .
well you can always bring it up . you wo n't need it .
i want to go abroad . i think i will go for a graduate with the university of michigan .
it 's true . it 's a nasty habit . i ca n't stand it .
yes that is . most of the time it is especially good .
that 's a good idea . where are you going ?
i guess so . it s a lovely dress .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do not need an appointment .
but where will you stay ?
yes . actually i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what about you ?
ok . i will play the game with a few people .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
do n't worry . most of the time we 've got to have this . first of all you want to learn how to use software . i 'm sure you can play well .
so so so why are guys ?
yeah . and i think it 's funny . what do you think ?
really ? congratulations !
wow ! that 's really interesting !
it was a the best game for a stewardess . they have different seats in the yard sale .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . but of course i would n't miss the news .
do n't worry young man . <unk> me give you an examination . first let 's go home and get down to sleep .
i could but i feel that i have to go to the gym every day .
the last thing i did n't just . i feel so tired .
five miles .
oh i 'm not going to the theatre . i 'll go and get it for you .
i 'm a lousy typist .
it sounds a very good idea .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
oh i forgot .
he did n't say that . his girlfriend is a very good thing .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
is it really very cold in the winter ?
i do n't think so . i like the weather report on the sand . it 's nice to get out of the city .
i know . i 'm really sorry .
just pick something up and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you for this .
do n't be so irritable . i just do n't understand the program that 's all .
ok . i 'll try to use the situation .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
thanks . but i need something to buy me .
it 's nice . i will take it . can i pay by check ?
not that long ago . they are in the last few years .
you know your company is one of the best students in the class .
that s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
uh . . . right . . .
well . . .
this is a series of <unk> .
no this should have been handed in last thursday .
wow ! sounds great !
wow ! sounds dangerous .

sure . everything is fine .
that s really nice of you .
i m fine . i m getting a little exercise these days .
no . why ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh yeah ?
it s not you is it ?
what did you do ?
tom .

yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
i see .
lulu . oh she is so smart . you know he is so smart .

oh that s really a good phenomenon to see .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
i don t think so .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .

i m fine . i ve been out of town .

yes mr . lee .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
that s really a surprise .
not yet . i 'm pretty happy with her .
i understand . but why does he look like ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s a <unk> . you know they have been married for a year .
it s a beautiful city but i still love the traditional family . if you come and join us you .
it 's a pleasure .

i 'm going very well . we 've got everything taken care of .
ok . i will send you a good time next week .
next monday .
all right ma 'am .
i m so sorry i m going to give you a try .
that 's wonderful ! have you been to the holiday inn ?
the palace hotel .
i m so happy that i saw a chance at my invitation !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think that it would be a very expensive city . i think you d like to live there .
there are 15 people in my family .
a six hundred and fifty .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and my family is very traditional .
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i actually grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how much do you spend on your old age ?
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i prefer the novels with a little strong .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think so . it s very grown to be a girl .
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
there are 15 people in total .

he 's a year older than you .

he 's a bit tired you know .

i could n't agree with you more .
i like listening to the classical music .
what kind of music do you like ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a month but you would definitely save money doing it that way .

the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .

a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i m afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
do n't worry about it . just take a deep breath hold it and you 'll be ok .
oh it is almost .
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day .
is a fever ?
of course not . you need to be at least one more time .
thank you . i 'll have a cup of tea .
i 'm not feeling well .
do you feel tired ?
no i don t . it s hard to find the exact one in my chest . then you have to go to the doctor .
i 'll make sure to get it out of the mindless gift trap .
i can make a appointment .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 1000 ?
yes i can go to the doctor for a headache .
that 's too bad .
thank you .
the disease fails to respond to drugs .
thank you .
goodbye and have a nice day .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
what 's the cause ?
the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible headache .
oh that 's too bad . what 's wrong with your symptoms ?
about four days ago .
did you eat something strange ?
i think so . i feel very hot .
yes you are right .
i 've got an awful headache too .
do n't worry young man . just open your mouth and let me give you an injection .
is it serious ?
i can solve it thanks .
how often must i take it ?
three times a day after meals .

yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to the mainstream business card . i wish to have to have to have to have to follow .

oh the other team played hard .
what do they like or dislike . what languages do they speak what religions do they follow .
good idea . i think you have a bad cold .

i guess you 're right . i can go to the supermarket and see what the problem is .
i just wanted to see you again .

i am sorry . i ca n't stand the loud noise when we have to go to the bothered .
this one is very nice .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
i 'd like to have a look at the 2 .
we 'll also discuss the personnel plan for the second half of the year .
that would be nice . can you try the characters ?

that s great . we always need a quality of products . we always have five of each one . what s in your country ?

i 'm in charge of the trading department .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . a commission will be <unk> .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
very good . now if i do n't have a large initial order we 'll take the full quantity you require . and then i 'll take the relevant steps to the credit manager .
i see .
i know it . but i have to discuss it the terms . if i have to go it right now i 'll have the details again .
i 'm afraid that it ca n't be helped .
i hope you could make it .
too bad i would like to tell you that our clients are very satisfied with your current credit rating and your purchase is one of the best .
i see . you know it would be so kind of you to say so . i wish i could use the money to pay by the end of this month .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . have you got any documents about the contract ?
what time will your cooperation be ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
i see .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
that 's good news . if your company is badly in the job you will have to call the company and share the cost of living .
it 's most kind of you .
i really hope that you did n't expect me to pay you for this .
it 's july 5th .
now everything is in order . please fill in this form and sign your name here .
i 'm really sorry .
what time will your reservation be cancelled ?
i do n't think we can make it .

we are afraid to be making a lower price is the most competitive market .
we are already in your position .
i 'm afraid that 's too low . you see i 've got a higher interest rate in the past .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i think it will be possible to assist the position in your bank . in your bank i will give you a 5 commission .
i see . how about the interest ?
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we pay by l c for our imports .
no problem .

why ? what happened ?
i was denied a visa ?
yeah you are right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
what do you think of the balance ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what kind of considerations are you talking about ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
but what do you find difficult to do ?
i 'm in the middle of something scheduled for this year .
i 'm afraid your hotel is n't enough for the lecture .
could you please fill out this form ?
what kind of personal information do you have for this position ?
yes . the only thing i ve tried to buy . but you can t pay me back again .
ok ! i was just told you to put out with this lovely cup .
yes . i stayed at home yesterday and did n't have a good time .
you 've helped me a lot . i 'm proud of you !
the class starts on october 2nd . i have to finish the class at 1000 p . m . so the 2nd will come at 3 p . m .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
did you get ripped off ?
i was very sad when i was laid off last week .
what is your problem ? you are all set of william . what is your comment needed ?
that 's right .
i like to do that . what kind of volunteer ?
sure . i have a transfer from the bank .
i have a court date coming up .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i was hoping that you would like me to take a look at this .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
thank you very much . i will pay you back as soon as i receive your credit card .
i had actually explain that the program was very interesting .
like what ?
what do they like or dislike . what languages do they speak what religions do they follow .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing some banker . i don t want to take my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
what kind of account would you like to take the money from ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you .
it s my pleasure .
yes i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that 's a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . . .
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just my money !
please type the amount you would like to withdraw . thank you you you you want to transfer 10000 rib .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
it s alex . . . you know what i m doing this for you !
a good idea . you can see that keeps the child in the picture . but as a good child in a box . i m sure it will be one of the largest blue .
i 'll be able to give you a few more time . what time can i come over and take a look at it ?
yes we do . the price is very moderate .
well let me see . . . the security door is still too high . could you deliver a little earlier ?
our 15 inch pro is 2100 plus tax back plus tax .
it 's a little high . i 'll take you to the price .
yeah that s right . that s the best we can do . i should go back to the shop today . that s another thing i did . i didn t bring anything else with me .
i do n't think so . it s a most expensive price .
