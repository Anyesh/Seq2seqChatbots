i think i ll have a small glass of orange juice .
i see . we can eat in the restaurant .
yes i would like to look at some of your hats . can you give me some advice ?

your products are very good but i think the price is too high .

what 's in it ?
for the job you want to send me a deposit .
what 's the price for a new apartment ?

you have a phone on the bedside table that you can use .
yes it is the right size but it s a little expensive .
what was the score ?
yes . let me give you this on the shirt .
do n't worry . i 'll make it up to you next week .
ok . here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the new perfume .
well the main reason is to go to the supermarket and have a look .
ok . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
it 's the same as the one .
actually i took out of them .
very good . i 'll get the food ready for you .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
thank you very much sir .

you 're welcome .
thank you .
would you like an appetizer ?
it is absolutely special .

well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that sounds like a very big order .
well we simply want you to listen to our records . we also have a model that is much better .
you are right . i would n't have to work any more .
we really think that that we have a good range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
i would love to get away from the home inspection .
ok let 's do it .
i think that the apartment is just a little less expensive .
yes it 's on our new house in the suburbs .
i guess the show is that it 's why they have so much money to buy clothes at the movies .
i think it 's boring .
that sounds like a very big order .
it seems that it is much easier to get them done .
actually in the world there are many houses nearby . i think it 's more convenient to get on the city .
ok . i can help you prepare for the list .
i 'd like to go to the railway station please .
first you need to get your ticket here . do you want to show your id ?

yes they do . for example if you want to see each side can be active you will have to stop for more time .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
you might be right . i guess most people believe it now !
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?

how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !

yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .

i think a train journey is still a bit less expensive .
i 'm looking forward to that an apartment . i 'd like to live with my degree in the next month and see if they have a house that would be great .
i see . we have a rental agent or a furnished .

when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks .
ok . bye !
ok . thank you .
where would you like to move ?
of course . first it 's a way to find a way to make a living . otherwise it 's not a problem for your own .
what is the rent ?
it s only about 300 pounds a month .
that sounds all right to me .
but it is quite expensive to get a room .
if you could make it to me by tomorrow i 'll have to go over the weekend . that is what i should do . i am afraid that the government will have to gone over the market .
i know . i am a little worried . but i really do n't know how to thank you .
i agree with you . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
i go to work during the week or i go shopping .
do you have any hobbies ?
that 's true . ok we will go to the university to have a great rest .
where did he go ?
he was in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
well i do n't know . maybe he is just asking me the question .
i do n't know . i am not sure if we do get the contract .
oh no ! what did he do ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
that 's a good idea . why not get off the bus ?
well i do n't know . i never really know what to say to them .
hi !
wow what happened ?
it 's ok . i 've almost finished . maybe you should get your hair there and i 'll call you if you did n't get home .
i m fine .
i 've been working too .
i 'm glad you could come .
thank you .
you re welcome .
i 'll call you later .

i 'll tell him to call you back as soon as possible .

yeah . it 's about time to go .
hmm . . . does he have a good ear for music ?
ok .
i 'm sorry sir . we are fully booked tonight . would you like to have dinner with us on next monday ?
i see . thank you .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do . what is it ?
i m looking for a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
yes i am glad you like it . i have been making a long time . it s been so long that i can t get the opportunity to stay in .
you have to buy your ticket first .
what s the side of the game ?
ok i ll see you there !
do i have to use the tv ?
fantastic ! i m going to go play the guitar and the guitar has a beautiful snack .
oh let s do it !
cool ! i ll show you the first one that s really good !
i m sorry . sir . i m not going to have to look an antivirus software .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
what size are you looking for ?
i d like a good pair of shoes . can i take a look ?
what ?
which university did you graduate from ?
i am sorry sir . it 's not allowed .
thank you very much .
that s true . but i don t think it could be so heavy .
it s a good thing we can do so .
i think that an advertising planner should have a trademark like that .
hey ! what 's that ?
i don t think that s an amazing art exhibition ! ! i thought that maybe i should get a picture of a famous art in a picture of a top of a child that would sell !
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 've never heard of a change .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know how to use it .
what about the kitchen ?
that s a deal .
i know but i m afraid i can t afford it .
no problem .
i 'd like to buy a toy car for my son .
the chicken breasts are 2 .
i would also like a bottle of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
yes i have read your brochure about the text messages and other things like that .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
ok .
no thank you .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
would you like another drink ?
i m glad you like it .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s gonna cut the cake !
do you think we ll need our overcoats ?
i want to return this book .
i see . what kind of flowers would you like ?
it s a special occasion . i m sorry .
well i guess you ll just have to wait .
what about the special features ?
that s a lovely hat .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
just use it honey . you know how to make money out your mind .
i m afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it will be taken care of it .
what do you mean by that ?
yes but i 've never had the bank come to the states before .
ah ! why do n't you take this up with me to some other section ?
it will be on next monday .
i know what you mean . i am looking for a position that is not big enough for my advice .
you know that this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you a new one !
i know i know . i have the feeling that i know . i don t like the way it s so complicated .
how do you know about the quality ?
what about this red wine ? how do i get it out of the latest ?
just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set !
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
yeah . we could go to the movies .
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll go and pick you up .
i think i 've got an idea .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
but if you want to go to the gym you 'll have to pay the same fee .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i 'll pick you up at the gate of your hotel .
ok . i 'll wait for you at 7pm at home . anything else ?
that 's fine .
that 's very nice of you .
ok . you have to prepare for it now .
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
why ca n't you ?
i need to get a passport .
certainly sir . the rental agent will also take you to the property management account .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
you ve got to apply for it right now !
awesome !
yes . i had a bad traffic accident .
i think you re right . there s a whole other way to the city . i don t think we ll have to return the city .
well what about your salary ?
i know i know . it was the first time i saw her with her . it was so embarrassing . i thought i should have known it .
i can understand that . if you can t fix the problems we ll then find it .
it is the most expensive .
that s right . it s lovely but to be frank it 's not the most practical .
it s a little overpriced . are you sure ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
i like spring too . it s a little too cold for autumn .
i am sorry . we do n't have any on sale today .
can you tell me about it ?
ok . i will take a look at the aluminum pan .
i don t know . let me try it on . i think it s still on looks .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks . i ll call again later .
it 's great ! the bedroom is a little small but the only problem is that it s pretty small .
you know i think it would be better if i had a different dress .
it 's certainly a big improvement in it .
but i think it 's better for the winter .
but i prefer the night with a nice room is bigger and more expensive .
it s nice but looks nice .
yes it has a balcony with an view of the park .
just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?
i have a lot of money to buy a burrito .
you 're right . i love it .
it s nice to meet you too .
it s only 24 a month .
that s way too much .
what s the most important thing for you ?
what are you looking for now ?
that s not a problem .
what s the problem ?
if you could lower the price by three percent would you prefer a lower rebate .
well i want you to know that i ve decided to run the car .
if you consider your weakness is much .
yes i do . i like cooking very much . the meal is free .
i don t know if it is not good enough to clean it up .
you know what we usually do is cook it . i hope you don t have as many things before you leave .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ?
i like indian food .
i ve got plenty of cooking . i need a lot of practice .
i usually buy namebrand clothing shoes and electronic goods . how about you ?
yeah but i love bargaining . it 's a popular dish with a bunch of <unk> .
i do n't know . just a few weeks .
what kind of room would you like ?
i want a black one .
an ordinary player ?
i don t think that s a problem . can you give me a rough idea of what you can get ?
you re right . can i a little bit ?
what about this one ?
yes . there s a department store on grant street . there are several floor in the apartment . which one would you like ?
i like the black one .
ok . anything else ?
any time .
great . you can draw your money from any small account at the end of this month .
good .
i m afraid you can t . you ve got a wrong number .
i 'm calling to let you know that the funds for nx567822100007 have arrived .
i 'm afraid it 's still vacant .
i think it would be better for me to see a doctor .
i 'm happy to hear that . when are you going to move ?
fine we 'll be expecting you .
i 'm afraid he 's fully engaged .
yes . i want to get some water .
ok . i will be there in a minute .
ok .
no but i ve got some help from you .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i see . what about this one ?
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres . it s very good .
i d like to see the room .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . i 'm going to find my own place .
i think that s a very good idea .
i think you ll find the right place . i can see it from the mirror .
let me have it please .
that s right . it s a nice room .
it s a lovely view but it s a little expensive .
it s a pity we can t afford a house .
i will take the pink one . it is a little too small for my skin .
just one .
well this is a great hotel but it is far from our city .
i think we can find the waiter that you are over there .
i don t know why it s so good .
i see . i can do it later .
that 's my great great great great idea . could you please help me to clean it ?
thank you . i am so happy that we can share the room .
let 's go look at the big tables in the kitchen . the night and the night itself has the sound of the big waves the sound of the whole night .
well we have an excellent service . we can provide that with all the employees . we also think that the company will provide you with all of that of our clients .
it s a little expensive but it s not allowed for you to use it .
i m afraid you can t . you ve got a message from there .
hello this is the property manager . i 'm calling to tell you that you are the right person we are here to offer you the position of manager . what position do you want to do ?
where are you living now ?
i m looking for a onebedroom apartment .
i can t wait to vote .
yes that 's right . i 'm meeting my wife .
i really appreciate it .
i 'm afraid i have n't got any .
what are you going to do now ?
thank you .
we still have some nice shoes .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
you mean you got working experience right ?
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory .
well let me take a look . i want a look .
is that a lot ?
yes it is .
i need a printer . i 'll come back tomorrow with just tomorrow .
what 's your date of birth ?
well . . . will you tell me about the balance sheet for the register ?
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yes it 's not that good . if you 're going to live in the city it 's not much trouble for your job .
i 'm glad you 're happy . i do n't want to come over to see us .
it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't find any foreign one . i think i should ask if i am accepted for my university .
well that 's not true . if you do n't mind me asking how to use your phone .
what ? do you know how to use a computer ?
i m trying to send you an email .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do .
what is your interests of the american culture ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
i think it s a good idea . what you are thinking of a good person to help calm down .
i want to try later .
i think you should make it .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . i 'll see you tomorrow at 2 00 .
how would you like your coffee ?
yes i do . i have an appointment with the hr manager .
oh sure . i 'll be there as soon as i get home .
yes please .
ok please fill in the form first .
i 'd just like to trim . but i do n't know what to do . just sit down a little .
i see . do you want me to cut it down ?
i 'm not sure whether i can try it .
you are very welcome .
it is not so bad . you can use the thinning shears on top too .
i haven t seen you for several days .
no it 's hard to say .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
ok well it was a pleasure .
well i suppose you have to run a few tests to save . but it 's not good for your health .
thank you mom .
do you want me to give you a ticket ?
ok . i 'll take it . thank you .
yes i do .
ok . let me try .
i must admit it . i 'm very sorry .
i hope that the restaurant is still there .
oh i 'm not sure . do you have a apartment for two people ?
oh come on ! what are you busy ?
ok let 's go look .
that sounds like a good idea .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that sounds like a very big order .
well we simply want you to listen to our records . we also have a model that is much better .
you are right . i would n't have to work any more .
we can try to find something suitable for you . let me know .
i hope you can have a nice trip home .
ok let 's do it .
i think that the apartment is just a little less expensive .
yes it 's on our new house in the suburbs .
i guess the show is that it 's why they have so much money to buy clothes at the movies .
i think it 's boring .
ok let 's have it .
it seems that it is much easier to get them done .
actually in the world the long run is n't it ?
ok . i can help you prepare for the list .
i am good at cooking .
you need n't have enough money .
i prefer sea food .
really ? i am glad to hear that .
yes i am . i have been here for three years .
what are you going to do ?
i like both of them but i do n't think i 'd like some green dishes .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
yes i 've been invited over to a friend 's . he 's from his hometown . one of my friends of my friends of mine say my company is very good .
that 's great . do you like some soup ?
you are my good wife .
how about a place of sichuan food ?
ok . i 'll have a try .
i think it is a good way to learn chinese food .
of course i can find one at the end of the street .
i need to get home .
yes i know that . i need this lipstick too . it s so much better than i can try .
oh i see . thank you very much .
you can keep it until next time .
rin ?
you re welcome .
i think it s good and it has a different color .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i think it s too high for me . what do you mean ?
i think i know . but i am afraid i ca n't promise you that .
ok . where do you flying ?
they are all here .
i really want to go shopping with an interesting place . can i go there to have a look at it ?
yes go ahead . i hope it .
i guess you are right . i like the fashion too .
i do n't know . i already got a car .
how about the one that 's a good way to relieve my anger ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know . i figure that myself but the prices are better . they are always hard to find a job at the end of the few things .
you was n't believe either .
i 'm afraid i do n't have to tell you .
the monthly sticker is 24 but the actual pass is free .
i guess it 's a good idea .
i hope you like it .
i 'd like to buy a shirt .
sure . how do you like your money ?
yes here you are .
that 's great ! do you see the <unk> of the traditional chinese culture ?
i would like to show them the cabin .
why do n't you try it on ?
well it does n't matter . i 'll tell my wife that you 're here for your birthday .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford your house .
ok . i 'll take them .
that s good . can you also take a picture here ?
i see .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm afraid i ca n't be able to accept that .
i do n't think so . i do n't know how to write it down .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 've been in a business relationship with you about it for a while now and i 'm here to show you around and we 'd like to have some business on your first .
here you are .
thank you . have a nice trip .
ok . i 'll do that then .
i think the quality of the photos will be quite good .
sure . what is it ?
well i ve lost my wallet and my id card .
do you have a trainer to eat ?
would you please fill out this form ?
i do n't know .
have you taken a walk ?
it 's not that many of the americans have the same experience in their group . they can even make their arrangement if they are really want .
well i certainly could n't eat anymore . my friends and i always felt well when i was a child .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
my friend and i are gonna go play the beach and we have a whole night left that we ll have to make sure that our picnic !
i hope i can get a few things to enjoy my stay in the city .
yeah well that 's okay . let me see .
yeah but it 's ok . you know i am hard to get used to it .
yes i can . it s very kind of you .
yes i do . i enjoy cooking very much .
yes it is ! everything is ready for you !
i usually run to the black bamboo park .
you ve got a high fever and a fever . i m afraid i must be going to be a vegetarian .
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
i like to swim and run .
you know it is a time to eat and we ll have a lot of dry red wine to be good for you !
i used to buy chinese food for us for the chinese food . but i do n't think it 's good for us .
well i believe your <unk> or twice will do just fine .
that s a place to go to eat .
yeah i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like both .
the ointment and push the button the button on .
yeah i 've got the flu . it 's not my fault .
it 's your pleasure . i think you 'll be a good day .
no thanks . i 'm full .
well i 'd like to try some kebab roasted squid and many different appealing things .
thank you you you you you you you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
no thanks . you can keep it from getting .
it 's not that i think it would be better for people to get away .
maybe you are right . i could n't figure it out .
no thanks . coffee is fine .
they are n't too difficult to make .
sounds like a plan . i 'll have a try .
no that would be great .
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
i could n't afford to .
i 've never had a burger before .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try some ?
sure that would be great . do you want to have a chicken ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
i know i ca n't wait to do it .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . please hurry .
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
it 's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
how about the rice ?
no thanks . i 'm full .
white rice please .
yes you 're right . i 'll have to ask my mother to give you a call .
i m thinking of buying some books .
i 'm going to the gym .
i 'm not going to make dinner .
what are you going to cook ?
i 'd like to get a burger .
i think i will have the dish .
do you like english food ?
i do n't feel like cooking . i 'm not going to order anything .
i 'm sorry i thought you were going to cook tonight .
what kind of food would you like ?
i 'll be back in a little while .
i 'm fine .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
i 'd like to get a coke .
ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
i know . i often feel like sitting at home .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'll have a glass of water .
i like to have a glass of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .

i do n't know what i want to eat .
but i 'm hungry again .
i like apple pie .
what would you like for dessert ?
well i like to have black tea .

ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
just coke will be fine .
yes i ll have a glass of water please .
yes it is .
have you any aches and pains ?
no thanks . i 'm fine .
what do you think of it ?
a cup of coffee please .
well we have many units without ice cream . you do n't need to take a few days to get away from your food .
that 's true .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
what about soda ?
well you 'd better have a glass of beer .
yes i ca n't seem to drink enough .
ok . do you want any sugar ?
i am not eating some chocolate .
ok . i 'll have a glass of water .

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i know . i know that it s the same as this car .
maybe . but i would find a lot of houses that i think a lot of people prefer . maybe a little more people can enjoy animals but more people do n't want to have so many public space .
well i know that it 's my policy to take . but if you want to change someone else we will have to pay more attention to the car .
do n't worry . i 've got to get a taxi . it 's faster to keep the car in the evening .
no i do n't .
what ? why did you buy it ?
i think that would work out better .
that s true .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds .
well you ca n't drive like this . i 've got to go shopping for a while . i 'm lucky you did n't get any nightmares !
ok .
yes i am . i have always wanted to go . i have always wanted to go .

i want to get a puppy for my son .

i think an active job is an important part of the art .
i really hope it would be expensive to think . i really hope it would be a little difficult .
i need to buy a ticket for some tourist attractions and i 'm not sure which one is better .
i hope i can get to meet some of my personal information before i move in .
i really hope we will continue our discussion .

what about our salesman ?
yes it is .

i understand . maybe you should do something for him .

i hope you can give me some advice .
but it 's so humiliating ! i do n't want my friends to know i failed !

i agree i had the same feeling when i was in college .
sounds like fun . let 's get in .

i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
well one pronunciation is not easy . it 's easy to handle . it sounds like a good file .
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .

do you think you can get a good chance to travel ?
i remember that . i was able to work with the team and little suitcase . i took the experience and the work i do n't think that i should do well .
maybe you are right but i still need more practice .
maybe that s true . but it s going to be difficult about people who have to speak to animals .
i agree with you .
that s true . is there anything that you should do ?

those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing that many countries are not very big enough for the world . many of the traditional and russia from england are well dehydrated .

i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
wow ! it 's a lot of fun !
i had been a similar job with a top performance in the future . i was not sure if i can manage it .
the couple of each time you have to use the same amount as you want .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i think it 's a brilliant advert !
oh i see . i can only read the subtitles . the <unk> is a little onto the <unk> .
i am not sure . perhaps you 'd like to go to a concert or something .
i would like to talk about that .
do we get a day off ?
i really have been able to high school . i really have a good time reading about my hand and so on .
what are the results of the test ?
no it 's not so popular these days .

i could take you for that .
well i know you are a graduate right now .
i really like the position . which kind of course do you like best ?
i want to know about the fees .
why do n't you take the test ?
you look a bit pale do n't you ?

why ? what happened ?
but i could n't help it .
it s ok .
yes but i still have one more question .
yes he has been having an easy time since he was a boy .
why did n't you tell him ?
he must be very easygoing .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
i m glad to hear that .
but it is lucky for us .
it 's made of pure wool .
what about this one ?
i know how you feel .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh i see . i 'd like to try some kebab roasted squid and many different appealing .
yes but it 's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market .
would you like me to tell you something about your outstanding achievements ?
it 's my dream .
i 've always had a chance to see you .
i think it s a pleasant experience to be a natural part of the world .
i agree with you . but it s not all that strong .
i 'm going to the movies this weekend .
you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight and i think that you should be a good thing for you !
maybe i can ask my girlfriend to come and fix it today . how about the dinner ?
no . it 's only 5 minutes walk .
i m so sorry .
well i m sure you ll enjoy your food . i can help you prepare for it .
do you have a lot of money ?
ah yes that 's what she 's interested in .
yeah . she is a pretty good worker .
i feel they 're dirty .
i think it s not a problem . it s just a policy of ours .
wait a minute . i 'll get the bag .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
i honestly did n't mean to .
i do n't care .
you did n't ?
i 'm sorry i did n't know .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
well i really do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
that sounds great . let me give you a second .
hey ! what 's wrong with you ?
what 's your favorite kind of video ?
i think i have a bad toothache !
well it does n't seem very hopeful to have that .
i am sorry i can t .

you did n't ?
it 's in the near the wall .

there is a lot of people waiting for you .
i was n't feeling well so i do n't think i 'm going to be a very good night .
what are you going to do now ?
i 'm an excellent student .
what kind of books do you like ?

i feel sorry for her .
what about your mother ?
i did but i heard that she should have done it .
it 's my acceptance letter from ucla .
yes certainly just a minute .
maybe we could talk about it this afternoon .
i 'll tell you what .
maybe he is busy with his work .
why do n't you tell me about this one ?
why is that ?
oh hey ! what a surprise ! you 're so concerned !
i 'd like to go to the movies . have you ever been there ?
what happened ?
i 'll call you later .
no . what are you talking about ?
yes that 's right .
they are all about credit rating and salary .
sure . i 've got it somewhere . what 's it ?
how many people has a key card for each person ?
how did he do that ?
i 'm sorry i 've got to get some cold .
he is a professional football player .
i 'm not sure . he 's a cheater . he 's not a girl . he always shuts down and makes me off .
well it was about a pound of about how much money you have to use for the monthly rent .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . but i think it 's a good idea to have a look at it .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think i did n't have any .
so you 're saying we 're all set . . .
my roommate . he 's a nice guy .
it 's the 11th avenue park street .
it 's a bad habit .
how did you do that ?
so did i . thanks for your cooperation .
oh how awful !
yes i did . he was also a student in college and a student english program .
cool ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
well they are n't as fun as you think .
oh i see . so what do you think about the service ? are you sure we did n't have a good time ?
i can still remember .
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
yes it is .
yes .
ah . . . .
listen i know you are a big fan of fun .
are you having a big party ?
do you have a credit card sir ?
and no hijackers .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i know but i did n't mean to look for it .
this one is good .
no mom .
yes of course . i will .
me too . do you think i could leave the office by the window ?
yes that 's right .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
you 're moving now ?
i thought it was a surprise .
what was that ? you didn t have to watch the end of the month .
you know i often have to work far into the night . i need smoking to keep me awake .
i could use some help i !
ok . i 'll tell you what the requirements are of your undergraduate work experience .
it says smoking is not allowed at all .
what about the features of these other churches ?
yes . how much is it ?
that 's really good .

i think it 's more important that i will start my new job as soon as possible . i plan to become more professional as possible !
well i hope you will do better after we finish this .
yes i 've just come here to see the credit card . you see i 'm a bit confused about the interest rate of the bank .
you must be joking !
yes . yesterday .

she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .

i 've been having a lot of trouble with my company .
what 's up ?
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .

i 'm sorry to hear that .
it 's ok .
what a pity !
i really wish i was free that night so i must go to the movies .
ho no !
yeah . i 'm not too worried about vince but i 'd hate to go by bus or on the bus .
what 's your plan now ?
we 'd like to come back again .
ok .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything .
i think i should study a little more .
i think so . here it is . here it is .
this is a really good one .
yes it is .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
it 's great ! i like it very much .
well i think the waist is a little tight and the sleeves are too long .
i think it 's boring .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it 's a picnic .
well i hope you will give me a call and let me know .
i guess you 're right . but what are we going to do now ?
i think the weather is fantastic .
that sounds like fun . maybe we can go to a bar in the park .
in that case let 's go to the latin club . we do n't have any in the mood to listen to the new bar . there 's a good one exhibition by the theater . we can go to the play in the golf club .
that 's good . i 'll have to go now .
i don t know how to get there .
it was me . i am so sorry .
it 's ok .
i think it was amazing . you can do a good job .
i hate this too .
i am sorry . i did n't mean to look at it .

i think i 'm going to buy a plane for my girlfriend .
how would you like your steak ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .

i really do n't know how to use your bus .
no it s not . may i take a message ?
hello this is monica .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is it ?
i 'm afraid there is a mistake on the bottom of my heart .
i 'm going to give you a call .
what 's the problem ?
i m afraid you re angry .
that s fine .
oh how much should i pay ?
does the train run a lot ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't do that . we have to get some groceries for tonight .
what was that ?
i m just wondering if we re going to go home and have to make lunch .
i am glad you know that . i do n't want any of the fish .
i don t know . it looks like the old one is really new and i m feeling detached or doing the same . it s either one or the kitchen . it s not like a <unk> .
well i have to hear that . tell me about your goals .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month .
well you can have a bird <unk> . . .
how long is the magazine ?
it s a bit strange . we will take a taxi to get there in about an hour .
what ! how much is that ?
no thanks . i just had a bad quarrel with my head and i got a terrible stomachache and i forgot to take it .
i was late to get home .
that s great . have you had any experience as a manager ?
i hope you are enjoying your trip .
you know that i care for you . i hope you ll have a good time .

that 's great .
i don t think so . let s go together !
it s true .

i hope we have n't meet the deadlines .
i am afraid we will get to the office on the way .
i am sorry . i know there are no pennies from heaven . i will work hard .
i 'm not going to be late today .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
i am going to go to the gym .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun !
no it 's not really . it 's just what i want .
you know what i mean . i am a junior but . . . that s the best way to practice . .
well that seems easy enough .
yeah . i think it s time to move on .
geez . is there a bonus for you ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . . . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um . . . sorry .
how about the sideburns ? you know only have a small piece of cake .
okay . um . . how much is it ?
i think i just have a casual evening and i do n't want to get a kick or just for my hair .
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's great ! i ve always dreamed of going to try some new furniture like a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did n't get a jacket and ca n't stand it .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
i think the government should change .
i guess .
i think you should do something for your new lives .
yeah . i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i know how the first thing that i can do is which gifts to keep and which ones are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that i one i have to exchange for my first day .
well i hate to tell you this but it is the first time we ve been on this busy holiday . it s really fun !
i see . have you received any scholarships ?
not at all . you really did a good job .
i might ! i might have a question . but maybe i might be a good thing .
it s nice .
merry christmas to you !
sure what 's up ?
you re not going to be able to take a look at the jeans . i ve got a small screen . it s pretty heavy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup of tea or coffee !
don t worry about it . i never thought of it . it s all my fault anna . you re so picky on it .
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day so you should shoot the breeze .
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let s call a .
how about this one ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
have you ever tried to lose weight ?
no i forgot to buy some .
i 'm sorry .
i hope you don t do that .
i guess you re right . maybe i can find a beer and i don t want to see a doctor .
i know ! why don t we go for a walk in the hills ? it s a very good thing that we can see a good deal .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m sorry sir . i can t give you a call .
i think so . i am ready for a walk in the park .
i think you re right . i bought a same shirt last week . it s just that the market is much more modern than your hair .
anyway i think it s more important to have a pet in advertising that market . i think it s better for advertising . and i need to have a brand that offers a lot of money .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you know i 'm a compulsive <unk> . i got to watch what i eat .
you are a good mother . i am sure you will do well .
you are right on the point . everything is so valuable and i know what i should do .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ?
good idea . can i get a pair of shoes now ? i am going to the gym .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach !
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end of the world . there s always a lot of modern things you know .
not everything just this film . have you heard of the latest fashion ?
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
if you have to make your disagree with you you they re not going to be angry with your friends .
i really love him too .
love stories ? more like .
yes it is .
you don t have time for me ! what about you ?
no i 'm just that i 'm too tired to fall in the night .

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
you know that s what i m going to do . i ve got a lunch here a little bit . are you sure you need a manicure here ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of rental ?
well first of all i m not interested in trying to give you a few tests that i m not interested in how to invest their money . i ve got to be honest i ve always wanted to be a little bit of weight .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
my motherinlaw just went into the hospital in the states and i have n't slept right through my house .
what 's the problem ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
well you can simply use some books to make money . but you do n't know you 're <unk> to do that .
i know . but i am not a good swimmer . can you tell me how to get to the room ?
i understand . sometimes the other party is more important than the others .
do you have any other outside income that make it ?
what 's up ?
it 's my acceptance letter from ucla .
i 've decided to but i 'm afraid i ca n't afford the new one .
i feel dizzy and weak . what makes me excited about ?

i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find it .
have you ever read a book before ?
not so soon .

you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .

it s a good thing to be like that .
haha . . . please do n't tell me you got a dead stack . i hate making cold calls . . .
no why ?
i m going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .

i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yeah . he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
he 's got a promotion .

did n't you see the dogs ?
i got it on one . i think it was that big .
really ? so you live in taiwan ?
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with it .
what a coincidence . i 'm just browsing .
i think someone is stalking me .
did he leave when you leave ?
what 's wrong ?
i guess so .
i think someone is stalking me .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
what happened ?
yes . is it a big one ?
well let 's do it !
great . i 'll enjoy both .
that 's right . and his wife will get the one in the kitchen . she is really funny .
yes it is . and it 's very convenient .
that 's really convenient . how much should i pay ?
that 's really cool . i 've always wanted to do that . you have many other questions about the contract .
i met him through a computer a computer a lot .
what are you going to do ?
yeah . but i heard that she 's going to be married in the first year of the year .
i had it when i left the house .
when ?
yes i 'm very fond of her .
i had it a lot but it was not the best .
i think that he had a litter too much of the future .
i told him that i ran a red light but he just didn t listen to me .
it is so beautiful . i wish i had a good time .

ok . see you then .
see you .
sure . this is a second question .
that is good . what is the ticket for the twentyfourth twentyfifth and twentysixth of the same name ?
so it 's simple for people not to spend their holiday .
so it 's interesting to see people from south america .
no it is n't .
it 's not that bad . i hate it . so what about the salary ?
well how about like this ?
it 's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
what 's it like ?
nothing .
yes . those two kids are very obedient and high in each other .
it 's a very good one .
and which platform are you going to go ?
it starts at 8
fine . that sounds good .
i 'm not ready to go to eat .
i 'd prefer going to go by train .
wow ! it 's huge !
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
i think it 's a good idea to give you a call .
thank you .
ok . i like the color and the style . it 's so heavy .
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
what is your reservation number ?
sure . it 's often the most popular season of the year .
and what is the purpose of the meeting ?
do you mean the bride s christmas party ?
what 's the holiday ?
they are french .
no fireworks are awesome !
yes i agree . people in the next country especially the authority in the same city are very popular .
well it seems like people from different ethnic groups in my country . the government in my country is one of the most expensive .
i will .
what a pity !
i really wish i could talk to you about this .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i do n't see any point in this place .
it 's the powell orchestra .
well i thought it was a bit slow . what if i 'm in real world ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
wow ! what else is it ?
yes . i want to get a few friends and i have a family to get married in the city .
cool ! anything else ?
you could get a burger and it would be good for you .
at 7
the school has some good reputation for the world .
do you know where it is ?
it 's my pleasure . well i hope you will have a good time here .
she 's your sister .
thank you .
well that 's right . well the apartments are just higher than the subway .
it costs 125 dollars a month .
it sounds like a hot room .
yes it s all right . but if you can give me the money back of the account the interest rate will be both .
we can make it a special offer for you .
i want to go to see a movie tonight .
so what would it be ?
hey look at the thermometer ! the temperature has hit 98 .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
so you are not interested in this job ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
thanks . now i understand what you mean .
i hope you ll visit us again soon .
thanks a lot .
it was a great game .
that was a good game .
you have a phone on the bedside table that you can use .
i think it 's boring .
i m so happy .
you must feel much better now .
that 's good .
yes .
i will .
i 'm glad i could come .
no thanks . i 'm full .
i do n't like fish .
you re welcome .
just coke will be fine .
oh good . what time does the flight get to rome ?
i do n't know why i ca n't . i just ca n't stand the bald man talking about me .
i figured it would be better for me .
sounds reasonable . what about the second part ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i thought you were going to get off at about it .
no i did n't . i was on the bus .
really ? you look so young .
yes i did .
it 's great to know .
it was nice of you to see a live show .
are you also going to beijing ?
do you think we 'll have a good time this weekend ?
i think it is very difficult to explain .
no please feel free .
do you know where the national bank is ?
oh right . i 've got it .
miss li . please have a seat . i know the employment of has already given you information about your employee contract but i 'd like to go over the main details again before signing . first you 'll be getting a monthly salary with one month paid vacation after one year of service .
disco is my favorite . you know i do n't like it .
you 're pretty good .
it 's a special one because the super girl is n't very smart and the super girl is n't very good .
it 's not all right . but i think the foxtrot and the tango are better .
oh yes . music is a good way to dance .
that sounds like a good idea . how are you ?
i see !
i think that they are quite reasonable and the forbidden city is the one of the most famous historical figures in china . the only problem is that the people are attractive way to go to special .
but is n't it the same with a much much larger size ?
generally speaking there are other sources of pilferage the insurance company 's must be <unk> to <unk> .
that s good . i m going to the opening match with the national newspaper .
they are in the eyes .
well this is good for me . all the attention of our products are made of <unk> .
good idea . i 'm going to the gym .
i enjoy working there .
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid i ca n't afford the night .
do you have any hobbies ?
thank you for the dance . i 'll show you the dance floor .
i 'm glad you like it . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes i 'd like to .
you dance beautifully too .
you 're a good dancer . .
do you know the waltz ?
yes i 'd like to .
what about your performance ?

i really wanted to go to the movies this year .
sorry i do n't often dance . i 'm afraid i ca n't dance very well .
i m sorry sir . i forgot to show you the table .
i agree . i appreciate the movie .
it says smoking is not allowed at all .
but it 's a good way to learn a language is n't it ?
yes .
absolutely .
yes .
we 'll have a glass of orange juice .
do you know the happy happy happy cap ?
it 's very nice .
what do you think about the food here ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
you dance beautifully too .
oh really ? so you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
thanks . i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes i like it very much .
disco is my favorite .
oh good . you 're a good partner .
it 's my pleasure .
ok .
i like variety shows .
tell me about it . what do you think about the city ?
no sir . it is n't .
oh i see . what a pity !
i do n't think so . let 's go to a lake . it 's a beautiful one .
what kind of sport do you think are the best fit for me ?
it 's not so cold as it is .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that s a good idea .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
maybe you 're right .
i like spring . the days are long and the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
it looks nice .
it s nice to have you to say so . but i really do n't know how i can get there from the city .
i think it 's the best season i 've ever had .
i 'm looking forward to it .
i like spring . it 's a long time .
i feel the same way .
it 's supposed to be sunny tomorrow and tomorrow .
that 's right .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i guess it 's the same in my city .
i think it s supposed to rain today .
great idea ! we have a lot of good weather in the city .
that 's true .
ok . please fill in the form first .
yes the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
yes i am from china .
what 's it like ?
what 's that ?
it 's very kind of you to say so . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you re welcome .
i ll take the tapestry it .
i think you deserve a promotion .
i really appreciate you for such a nice evening and happy birthday .
sure what is it ?
what 's the tariff ?
i will be there on time .
it 's time for the weather reporter .
that 's fine . i 'll pick you up then .
yes . i have a class around there .
you are not going to see a movie with me at the bar .
i 'd like to .
it 's over there .
oh are you ? i thought you were interested .
i was robbed this morning .
ok . we can book you a private room for up at that time .
i 'll see you then .
it s great because it s fun .
i love it .
it is not that bad . it 's just the kitchen .
i guess it was . some people are too busy to drive . i guess it still makes the same thing .
i 'm trying to send a letter to france .
how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
what was taken ?
it was many years ago when i was younger .
what else is wrong with it ?
i think it 's too slow .
i would n't agree with you more .
no thank you .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know . i am going to try my best to find a job .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
what does he look like ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you re welcome .
you re welcome .
you are so lucky .
oh my god i think i 'm mistake .
how do you feel about your english ?
yes he does .
what did you do after you vote ?
i 'm afraid i have some business to attend to .
it s a love story .
then i 'll try to find her again .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but i think it 's not a date .
yes of course . but i 'm not a big party today .
i 'm afraid we ca n't have any time to attend the night .
i 'll try .
they must be just excited about it .
that 's good to hear .
yes i have one of the best ones in this country . i have two older brothers and one younger sisters .
hi ! i m glad to hear that .
it 's a pleasure .
it s been a long time since we last saw each other .
you re welcome .
i really do n't think we should go now .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
that 's easy . it 's a good thing to do .
i know . i just don t want to see the girl s eyes .
don t be so sad .
oh i see . she looks very attractive .
you can t just change your mind . you can t use it .
i 'd love to .
ok . let me see . i 'd like to draw some money from my current account .
i agree with you . i ve had a lot of time . you know i love him .
it 's student practice . reading is usually a good way to relieve anger .
you 're right . i can also get a quick picture from the doctor .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i hear that some people say that americans spend money on advertising .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm afraid i did n't mean to .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you re right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes i did . it s a good party .
you re right .
it 's great !
what do you think ?
could you tell me more about the balance sheet now ?
yes .
yes i think so . i bought it in the mall but i bought it .
well it 's for the best in my business days .
very interesting . so it was your first interview that was a time to think over a years ago . it was fun for your team .
yes .
but i think the focus is on how you are .
how about this made of plastic ?
well i hope you 'll have a good chance to come and join us again .
have you been working hard recently ?
i know that something about it . and if you do n't mind me asking how to get on the contract i know .
i could n't agree with you more .
no thank you . i can t .
you bet it .
i 'm afraid i ca n't see you again .
i do n't want to .
oh come on . you know it 's bad for your health .
no . it 's not really an overdraft .
no i do n't think so . i think i am a little confused about the rules .
i did n't know he had a lot of homework .
i am so sorry that i was so attracted by the burglar .
yes they were . i was n't there a lot of nightlife and a lot .
i know . it 's going to be a really good thing to do !
they were supposed to but so far nobody s turned up and i m left on my own to do the work .

yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
it 's pretty cold in winter .
it 's boring right ?
i do n't think so . i think it 's a great party .
how long will it take ?
i think so . we do n't have a lot of time in our city . we can go to the park this weekend .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it is .
i hope it stays like this .
it 's not too bad but i do n't know how it is today .
it certainly is . the sun there is a little beauty treatment and the flowers in the middle of the city . there are many trees there .
this is the result of change . time of day our day has become a day .
okay . hey do you know how to play the guitar ?
i do n't think so . i do n't think the weather report last week . i woke up this morning and had a really good time . i woke up this morning .
i hope it will get hotter .
yes i would like to have this finished .
i m afraid i won t . i ve got to go to the hospital . i can t wait to see a doctor .
whatever you say .
oh no . that s just the smell of my nose . i was wondering if i could have her a black coffee or something .
you must be joking !
that lucky guy .
he s fine . he s a bit tired .
what did he do for restoring the young man ?
not bad .
she s going to be here for a while .
he s not feeling well .
fifteen minutes ?
you mean your husband 's boyfriend ?
yes he 's not bad . he did n't know how to express his opinion .
maybe . but he 's busy then .
what did you do ?
but it s a good movie . it s a very romantic one .
you must be joking !
yes she is .
i really do n't believe that there was no reason to go .
i would n't do it if i were you .
i would n't do that .
it 's very dangerous is n't it ?
i 'm afraid i have n't . i 've never had a chance to take a plane .
what do you think about the food ?
i 'm afraid i have n't got much larger ones .
well i 'll talk to you later .
i ll have to do that .
i think i have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
you 're kidding .
you are just a little more .
can i help you ?
what did the score ?
yes it is .
ok . i 'll call you later .
but she did and made me disappointed .
that 's right .
you said it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what are they ?
i 've been having a bad problem . i think i should start working as a trainee in his company .
what are you going to do now ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
not bad . i 've got a really bad cold and my head is dizzy .
how many days will you be staying at ?
we went to europe .
he told me that i 'm an engineer .
i 'm sorry sir but i ca n't do it again .
i ve been having a bad hangover this morning .
what does his dad say ?
he is finishing our final exam tomorrow .
i 'm not sure which one is hers .
but i think it 's really nice of you to give me the cake .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
he is ! he s a hard worker !
you know that s the reason why he did n't show up . he s always on the go .
i am quite familiar with the medicine industry and i think i am good at planning to meet the american people .
how can you be so sure ?
well i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
i don t think so . i do n't know what a great wife does .
yeah . he has a lot of homework .
do you have many friends ?
i 'll call him and tell him you 're here .
that 's ok .
what happened ?
thank you .
well i 'd like to be in the states but i have n't decided yet .
he borrowed a nick of money from his girlfriend .
yes . here it is . how many years have they been ?
i 'd like to .
don t worry about it . i m learning how to play tennis at work . it s ok .
ouch that hurts did you have to do anything . do you know the room ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked if i was his wife and they wanted to go there tonight . she did n't know if i 'd ask him to get yours .
well you know it s going to be a great time . i have to get married on a special day and i really want to get married .
i think it s as complicated as it is .
well . we all know that people from different countries used to think that we are in a way of making money from different countries .
i mean what s more there are n't enough outlets ?
well that 's all right . he 's all busy on the weekend .
i think you are right .
maybe you are right .
well we do have a lot of employees . in our company there 's always a big standard of us to get their approval from our government .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
i honestly did n't mean to .
did n't i ?
you did n't ?
i 'm sorry i did n't know .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
well i really do n't think you 'll like the house then .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
so you 're hearing from your experience ?
what 's more his favorite number ?
it 's true .
i guess it is n't that bad .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i hate him either . he seems like such an honest guy .
of course not . but i like the way you like them .
i like the slow dance . i like the universal studios and weekiwatchee springs .
i like to have the dog .
how do you get along with each other ?
what do you think about her ?
well what do you think about her as a teacher ?
no i do n't think so .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah .
i 'm so happy for you .
thank you .
not bad . i 've got to get a bunch of pearl earrings .
you must have been really hurting for such a heavy smoker .
thank you .
and your mother is a worker .
you have good taste in your mouth .
yes i did . it was one of the best ones available . but that 's what i feel i should do .
well there are several tiny countries in europe . people in europe have also suggested that it is a big deal .
i don t think i ve ever tried one of those before . it seems that i don t see any of them .
well i 've always dreamed of seeing you so much .
sure . i 'll be happy to see them .
oh i know he really deserves it . but he is a nice guy .

i can t believe it .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
who cares ?
i really thought this was our stop .
she has a fever and a bad headache .
right . anyway the basic difference between a high level and being women are not allowed to take care of their children .
yeah . he s a good team .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
that 's wonderful . i love the apartment .

i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
it 's not that bad . if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start drinking . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
i never thought about it that way .
that 's because you did n't have any rights ?
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
why are you so many extra money for the train ?
it 's just what i wanted .
it 's not too late .
i am really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a table reserved for two nights . .
i think the best we can do is to reduce the price by 10 .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .

that sounds like a good idea . let 's do it .
no way . i m afraid i can t .
let me see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 're out of town .
i 'm not sure but i think i 've got some serious serious serious .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
that would be very useful .
i just lost my job and i 'm having a terrible terrible cold .
why do n't you sleep well last night ?
yes it is .
that sounds like a good idea . you need a holiday .
it certainly is .
i do n't think i was wrong with the singer .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you have a lot of friends .
yes i would like to do a lot of things on the holiday .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .

i hope you like it .
i like the design of this one .
don t worry . i m sure you re right . there s a lot of competition from our customers . i think it s pretty good .
i have a sore throat and headache .
it s a deal .
yes i am . i 'm looking for a job that is more advanced than the corporate world .
i 'm going to add a cdrom drive and come back home .
i see .
i 'm fine . i just got back from the minute of my life .
i think that is just the matter of getting you covered .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we have a lot of time but we have to go to the movies . they have a lot of fun and they have to clean up .
i understand . and the minimum deposit for my current account ?
here 's your receipt and the receipt is overweight . you must pay extra for it .
i think you re right .
it is ok with your experience for me .
well i have to go to university . i 'll go to an english exhibition .
why do you want to quit ?
no but i 've never seen a few tshirts in my life .
i would if i ever ask my parents to live with me .
well i understand . it 's good to have you here .
no they never wear suit or not but they 're just too young .
well when you tell them you are in a hurry to do things .
how sweet . what if i stay with you ?
but it 's a good company . it 's very expensive .
have you been to california ?
how long do you think it will take to get to the train ?
they did . we started school this morning . i guess i 'd better not .
what did she do ?
well it seems to be my favorite in order to have this package .
that sounds interesting !
the organizational structure is the position of human resources manager .
that 's so bad . i wish i could afford that .
well that 's true . if your son starts to buy one of their own pets .
wow ! so many people in south america now .
oh i see . i guess i should try to keep the suitcase the old one is better .
that sounds terrible . what is the problem ?
you are right . but she got angry with her from her mother and she did her baby .
i can t believe it ! thank you so much !
that is not what the matter . he is a terrible habit .
well i ve invited my parents for their wedding but now i know how to do it .
well it s not that bad . we just had a complete drop of them up in the morning and we forgot to get him something to drink . it s just one thing we had a lot of money to get up .
how can you tell me about this ?
i do n't . i used to work alone but i do n't think i 'm going to be a terrible team .
really ? that 's great . i thought it was nice .
that sounds terrible !
that s true . if you had to work my whole day and got to work so well . i think that s ok .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to help . what else did she ask about ?
i understand .
how often do you meet at the office ?
you have to do it . it 's good to have a good rest .

and it s funny .
what about the cinema ?
you are a lucky man .
you are a very lucky child .
what is your favorite sport ?
what 's your favorite sport of all time ?
it depends .
i do n't really know . i do n't like football .
what is your greatest weakness ?
well maybe you re right . but what if i do n't know how to play the piano ?
well we have a lot of money in the city . the government is working on it . besides we eat and take a lot of fresh fruit and a lot of other things .
sure . let 's meet at 600 .
that 's right . some of my friends from university enjoy the same thing .
hey sounds great !
do you know the news ?
but one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the way for it to work out for it .
i see . thank you .

i am looking for it but i can t decide whether to take it or not .
yes i 'm from taiwan . i 've never had a job in the states before .
yeah his house was one of the best things to pull out .
what did he do ?
that 's a good idea . you 'd better get a try .
it was a real red letter .

i don t think that i ve decided to leave a lot of it .
i do n't know . maybe you are right but when she started her new job all the time i wanted to tell her that she was a bit that i wanted to be a volunteer .
some people are wearing that . i like to read a book that 's part of my own .
you are so lucky .
that 's a great idea . you can put it in a tie .
what do you do on the machines ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
cool !
well it 's very windy today . we have the same thing in america but we 've all got to be friends .
the government should take some measures to curb it .
no i did n't .

i 'm not sure . i think i 'll let you know when i get back .
oh yes .
what do you think ?
ok . do you want me to take the class ?
what did the results tell you ?
i see .
we can visit the great wall and see if we can get a car in the city .
yes it is .
the time period is three months old .
yes it 's all set .
all right . tell me about the other alternatives .
i am thinking of doing some research into the internet .
well . . . you know sometimes believe in the future is not so important .
that 's true .
yes quite right . there are too many cars too . people in my city are very not very big .
no not at all . first of all i 've had a few problems . the olympic games were broken . . . there was a big accident on the other side . . . .
good . i 'll get some too .
if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted . do you have a good time ?
i feel great !
i will be there .
yeah i guess i should . it 's nice to have a good time .
are you a dancing teacher ?
what would you like to see in beijing ?
oh that 's him . he looks like a guy who d ever do that .
ok his wife and the tie .
yes .
i ca n't agree more . that 's why he 's so competent .
yeah . but anyway he is driving me mad .

you are welcome .
my name is jessica . i 'm jane smith . nice to meet you .
yes .
nice to meet you too .
good morning mrs smith .
well we can make it through our financial situation .
you re welcome .
ok i see . thank you .
i think that 's true . i know there are too many people working as well . when i get home to the office i do n't think about it .
how about recycling ?
yes . you can make a few photocopies and send faxes over there .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i would love to come .
i will . do you think we can get together and meet some of the people in the afternoon ?
hey what about the rice flour and flour in your relaxed dress ? what about the rice ?
i see .
yes . it sounds nice .
i 'd love to try it .
i 'd love to .
i think he 's known as well as you know . before i got the play table i think i 'll enjoy himself . it 's great for him to learn chinese .
you ca n't say that .
do n't you know only the day ?
oh my god ! i 'm sorry .
it 's just you two . he never said anything .
poor guy !
thank you . nice to meet you too .
you 're welcome .
i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes actually the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
i see . all the people in the chinese are proud of the great wall .
i see . then what about the trip ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh i like the way that the chinese style in america too .
yes . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft elegant music a teahouse is often a noisy crowded public space . people visit tea
yes i like almost all sports and i enjoy watching . i especially like to watch football games .
yes i like it very much but i do n't like it very much .
yes it is . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . the bucky card is a big problem . it s a great way for a while to save .
what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
the winter olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
what 's your favorite winter sport ?
i like baseball the best .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh but i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
what are your friends of ?
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's a bunch of fun .
hey look at my museum . it 's going to help me with my own eyes .
i think those are a great movie . they must have been making records of <unk> .
there are different kinds of folk collections . you can see that many ancient chinese people have all over the world .
i agree . i agree with you . are there any commercials on the tv ?
yeah . i think it 's a good way to save energy .
that makes sense . does the tv work well ?
of course it is . it 's a good deal .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . we have a position in our company .
he s huge !
is that right ?
he 's the guy who had a question .
oh yeah . i see . so what about the drink ?
maybe you are right . but i have to work too hard .
ok . i 'll take one . . . wow ! what a beautiful color are you ?
i love it too .
well i 'll celebrate it .
there are plenty of rugby in my country .
when do you know your major ?
that s my opinion .
what other sources do the nurse tell you ?
that s a lot of fun .
that 's right .
there is a lot of rugby in my country .
he did a good match .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i feel too lousy to go .
you know what i heard too much about a woman i thought that maybe we could get him something that way .
i m sorry to hear that . maybe you can just go to the movies .
what happened ?
and it 's a pleasure to have a taste for us . it is time to think and it will work out .
i must have slept right through it .
well let s take a look at that rash . . . . we ll get back to you in about an hour .
ok i guess i do n't have a finger !
well i m sorry sir . the only time i ve tried and i didn t want you to tell me about the delay .
no but the north of the back are sore .
well we can still get them to the health center .
no i did n't .
i suggest you buy 1000 or more a good quality product .
it sounds like a good idea . why do you ask ?
buses are more cramped and you can t walk around .
maybe . i think a lot of people do n't want to see a doctor .
i 'll give you my credit card .
yes i agree . that s why we have to work on the retired . we could get a lot of money .
well you can have a try .
the other large house are just over the last few large chemical in the city . the only problem is that most of the office are in good condition .
yes that s right . i usually go on the inside of the office . i usually go back to the waterfall in the city or on the road .
no i did n't .
you are a fool !
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
i wish he could do that .
what a lucky guy !
well if you think it s not a practical problem i can do it as a friend .
yeah . the forbidden city is divided into two parts . the government service have the same blood in the us .
he should get a tie . a tie is like him .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
it was a very good game but the people here are concerned about their group of goods . as you know the great play is much more important than in my country .
that is true . but my passport was in a big city .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . well the city is located in a beautiful city . would you like to go to the top ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like almost all of them . i guess i like it better .
what kind of sport do you like best ?
i like the novels of inches very much .
you 'll find the time you need to get a seat .
yes . the game is hard to benefit .
that shouldn t be a problem .
you can also play badminton with the children and girls .
it is a very good game . you can also play ball into the piano .
not at all . i did n't watch much television . i like to watch it at all .
what does it say ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
i m fine thanks . and you ?
have you had anything to eat lately ?
i don t have health insurance .
perhaps you ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason .
you know i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
well i m sure you ll find your lunch there . maybe it s better for you to get a good breakfast .
yes he is . he can t decide which to go to his schedule .
ok . i understand . when did you have him ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t wait to watch it .
i like the novels of dickens too . i like the novels of animals as well as you can see more than other people are concerned about the traditional architecture itself and character .
it s very interesting .
yes .
you must be very serious . usually one or two films will be paid for it .
i like the category of best trading students . it s quite different from each other .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have any other questions so far . when will you be located ?
i only buy him a lot .
i see . i d suggest you read them . i d be sure he does .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of the movie ?
i was but then i discovered you can find everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i bought it in the bank .
you did ?
i think you should give them some credit . they must have just come back from the government .
i bet it would . really they thought that they were supposed to be popular with each other .
i think that s true but i think they must have figured it would be hard to save . and i think the government would definitely not have such an easy life to do .
i think they want to have a beautiful shower but i think they need to have to make more money .
why not ? i don t have any credit on my bill . if i have any children i don t have enough money for how long a show !
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . why not send some money to cover the market ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
what kind of style do you want ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
you are a happy job .
yes what time would you like to come ?
let 's meet in front of you .
ok we will be expecting you at 1130 . see you then .
yes but i prefer red wine with meat .
really ? there are n't many left now .
oh i see them .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there are a lot of animals around here . but it s in the north of my city . there are plenty of animals here . we also have the birds here .
oh they are n't . i 'm a little nervous . i 've never seen a movie before .
it 's a etv palace . it 's a good thing .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
i hope you can stay with me .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
yes . i remember now . we met at the holiday party . i thought you were very good .
well it is about a married couple . people from work together who are going to live with that people .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i was invited to graduate this summer vacation .
what 's the matter ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
what did he say ?
yes . he said i 'm his dream girl .
what did he say ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
why do n't you speak english ?
no you have to .
good . red suits me very well . it s a lovely dress .
so you 're hearing from the book ?
oh hello amy . what a great surprise !
i m a sales manager in a publishing company . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the matter ?
yes .
yes i am going to the hospital to see a doctor .
thanks for reminding me . do you have a chance ?
pardon ?
what time would you like to have dinner with us ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
what was your specialty ?
i saw a man come in with a gun .
yes i 'm sorry sir . i 'm very sorry about that .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
yes i 'm sure i 've done a good job .
ok .
i do n't mind the work . i 'm glad you could do it .
it does n't matter . i do n't think we have a very good one .
i thought you knew .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
what about tomorrow morning ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
why not ?
it 's all right . please leave the message to my room .
i 've got a bad headache .
ok . what 's the extension number ?
i 've been thinking about it for some time now .
honey it 's all your fault .
yeah i 'm really excited .
why do n't you just get the desk by the window ?
we 're not working in the city !
i see . well you have to do some exercise . you 'll have to get a lot of exercise .
i am sorry . i have to call the police .
you 're welcome . and we wish you good luck !
i 'd love to try the chef s salad course .
i 'll go and get a burger and i 'll take a walk .
you 're welcome . i 'll see you tomorrow at 2 00 .
well good luck to you .
that sounds like a good idea .
what was the most significant project you 've worked on ?
well . . .
they usually give me their email address .
what about your other expenses ?
there s an interview on french dressing plan .
that 's a good idea . but it seems that if a girl is a crush or something like that .
oh that sounds like fun . maybe i 'll go with one of my friends .
that 's right . do you know the boss of the boss ?
how are you ?
yes i did . i 've almost finished it . i 'm glad i did n't have any problems .
i 'm afraid you ca n't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
that 's a big problem . we have many other applicants for this position . the first one we must follow the general office . it is really hard to find a way to get through our approved form .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
it will be close at the next meeting .
ah thank you . actually i had forgotten to tell you that my little bit about your experience .
sure . i d love to but we ve got a lot of time .
we ll have a picnic .
that sounds just perfect .
that sounds perfect .
i can t believe it ! i knew you were only going to catch a few things out there .
hey do n't matt . what 's up ?
so what are you doing ?
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
i know . but i just ca n't forget him .
what i understand .
i 'd like to very much .
it s a program that has a very big tv so there s a lot of noise from there .
that 's pretty good . i 've never heard of such a thing . what 's it like ?
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? so you just took it in one year 's history !
yes i am . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is so thin . i have to be there only one piece of cake !
ok just send me through them and we will be ready in one week .
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should get a tongue piercing !
yes i 've decided .
what is it ?
i think it 's boring .
i really hope we will .
that s right . don t worry . he s an acrobat
i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur .
how many more games are left this season ?
you 'll be not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
oh that s fantastic !
that s possible . they are too fast . i think they might be so much to move . the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
i 'm sorry i have to watch my baseball game .
yeah i was . i ve never had the guts to tell you .
maybe that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
huh ?
yeah it s a great movie . i can watch it for you .
let s do it !
they re doing fine .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he ll be running at the regular end of the long jump . he s got a jump in !
that s interesting . what does the maximum mean ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . they are not very fast . they are just in the moment .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
i don t think that s because of that .
yeah that 's my wife .
oh that 's right .
he is a professional expert .
what 's wrong with him ?
i 'd like to .
i was hoping to go out somewhere for a drink .
well good luck to you .
ok . i ll be there in a minute .
no thank you .
ok i see . well can you tell me how to send one of your <unk> to each other ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
what time would you like me to come ?
how about 7 o 'clock ?
all right . thank you very much .
no problem .
you don t have that problem .
it 's an open book that you can get a student pass .
no i was out . did i ?
let 's do it .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what 's that ?
yes but i 'm busy .
i 'll give you a call if you need any help .
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid it 's quite a beautiful day .
what are they ?
i 'm afraid so .
i think it 's going to be better for the next three days .
yes .
what size do you wear ?
you should n't have been so early .
i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
so what did you do ?
yeah .
you have to have a taste of fruits for fruits and vegetables .
i guess i should learn how to save money . i just have to save money .
oh that sounds great .
well actually i ve got to go for a walk . i ve got to get a drink .
not really but i like watching .
yeah i agree . i tried to quit last week and i thought i 'd stop learning some basic rules and do some rules .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
what about your daughter ?
i do n't think so . i think we d be a lie to me like that .
i agree . i think it 's a sheer waste of time .
wow you 're right . i think the only reason is that i am a bit nervous .
well there is a good exercise for you to keep fit . what s your greatest exercise ?
i ll try that .
i think you should really try this kind of car .
you mean you like to study english ?
sorry for hear that .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i think i should go and look at the same side of the tv .
you can always go to the movies take care of their business .
well i 've always wanted to be a part of the city . i like the working day and the people i think it 's a lot of fun .
well i m going to take a few tests to get some books from the university .
yes that is a great way to learn .
yes i did .
we are going to visit the famous national park .
so we must get married .
yes certainly . but i want a second pizza .
yes i have been invited over to a friend s and you ?
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i want to become an english professor in the future . how about you ?
i hope that we will have better luck .
you are right . i should have known it . thank you for saying so much .
good morning !
yeah i just got off the phone and my car broke down .
i think that is a good idea .
i m sorry i can t . i ve got to go .
that s nice .
it is so encouraging to hear this remark . the company has established good salaries to employees .
that s fine .
that sounds terrible . what is the problem ?
you are right . but she got angry with her from her mother and she did her baby .
i can t believe it ! thank you so much !
that is not what the matter . he is a terrible habit .
well i ve invited my parents for their wedding but now i know how to do it .
well it s not that bad . we just had a complete drop of them up in the morning and we forgot to get him something to drink . it s just one thing we had a lot of money to get up .
how can you tell me about this ?
have you been to california ?
how long do you think it will take to get to the train ?
they did . we started school this morning . i guess i 'd better not .
what did she do ?
well it seems to be my favorite in order to have this package .
that sounds interesting !
the organizational structure is the position of human resources manager .
that 's so bad . i wish i could afford that .
well that 's true . if your son starts to buy one of their own pets .
i can t either . i m really glad we ll go .
well sir i do n't really know but the reservation was in a hurry .
i bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
well i know what you mean . the first time there s no one we have to go there for a reason .
do you think we ll have the chance for the next one ?
merry christmas to you !
yeah . i just got back from the theatre . i 'm scared of water .
it s a birthday party . we ll have a christmas party this saturday .
yes it is .
well i wanted to go but i m afraid i can t afford it .
well . . .
you know i 'm in a hurry . i 'm late .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know that .
it s ok .
i guess so . so what do you think about this city ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well we could have this to celebrate a dinner party this saturday night and have a good rest also .
a party is a party .
ok i see .
i feel they 're dirty .
i think that s the reason why i m here . we re at the same time .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i see . so your company is huge and well behaved however in the long run .
that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you think we should spend ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i went to visit an uncle . he s in the hospital with a new his secretary .
really ? how did you get there ?
i went to a small town in the mountains with lots of fun .
what is the purpose of your visit to your visit ?
yes . it was very kind of you to say . i enjoyed working with you .
no i just missed it .
hi tom i m susan marshall you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
this is bob . where are you going ?
do you do that ? nice to meet you .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation .
oh i m sorry . i ve never heard of it .
yes i do . what do you do there ?
it 's just that it 's a hard time to do . it 's too plain on its own .
i am sorry . i must have come .
no . it 's a lot harder than i thought .
thank you .
i 'll have a try .
i know . i m going to the same home myself .
ok . how long will it take to get to the library ?
i really like that outfit .
how about the museum of modern art ?
some friends of the office work in the city .
maybe we should do some shopping . that s why people go to the art gallery instead of walk around the city .
i do n't . i used to work alone but i do n't think i 'm going to be a terrible team .
really ? that 's great . i thought it was nice .
that sounds terrible !
that s true . if you had to work my whole day and got to work so well . i think that s ok .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to help . what else did she ask about ?
i understand .
how often do you meet at the office ?
you have to do it . it 's good to have a good rest .
why do you want to have this ?
it 's only 20 .
well maybe you should ask my sister .
yes but we are so lucky . we may not have the heart in the city .
we are too busy to stay here . we could n't have any vegetables in the kitchen .
it should be close but it will be close .
why not ?
it is . but i ve never heard of it .
no i 'm afraid not . i 've got to go . it 's my first time being late .
yes but i have to do it .
i 'm not sure . i think i 've got a cold .
i 'll wait for you at the cafe and walk .
her acting is ok .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do that .
i 'm afraid i do n't know less about her .
it 's great ! that s the secret .
he has a very good voice .
i think i was good at the beginning .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you 're right . we have a different styles of music .
no but i do n't think it 's too far to be a lot of people .
oh i did n't really like it .
what 's the weather like today ?
cool . does it have a dark cloud over there ? it 's very kind of you .
yes i went there last week . it was an exciting game with lots of best times .
it 's a piano solo . i 'm fond of piano you know .
what 's in it ?
i 've always had a chance to see you .
i think it s a pleasant experience to be a natural part of the world .
i agree with you . but it s not all that strong .
yes i did . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun .
you ll have to make it .
i hope so .
but it s true .
yes i went to the national economy .
have you ever read a good review of an exhibition by your school ?
what about the qualification needed ?
ok . i 'll get back to you in a minute .
yes it is . but you have to be back by 5 o 'clock otherwise we will not get off at the airport as soon as possible .
that is a good idea . it is a pity that we will have a good working conditions and our company will be in a meeting .
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok . let me put it in the details .
ok . i will ask lucy to call you in two days .
not very well . he has a lot of good news . he has a lot of good news and his really funny .
that s true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long run . this is a major opportunity for business card .
they are complete waste of time showing the amount of <unk> and are complete waste of time even in the past few days .
i don t know why but the problem is that most of the traditional and the traditional problem is now .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home but it s the worst thing i ve ever had before .
it s hard to commute a long way .
it s a good deal . the people are very friendly .
great . let 's get started !
haha . i know you are not going to quit soon . maybe you will be fine .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
what brand ?
i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't .
yeah but i did n't . . .
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
it 's better for you . you can get a phone card at the taxi for you .
what happened ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
well let 's go to the etv .
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
look ! there 's nobody in your eyes . you should get the highest in line for her .
what 's your favorite title ?
yes it is .
you are right .
yes it is . it 's nice to see you again .
i think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . would you like to help me with that ?
it 's going to be there by 5 this afternoon .
that 's right .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i must tell you the truth .
i think it s supposed to rain today .
we do n't need to get any sleep .
i 'm afraid it 's too early to go to find a place to live .
that s true . but i love being in the summer it can be summer .
i think it s too cold for your stomach .
but it is true .
yes i am from china .
so where did you go ?
i m sorry but i ve gotta run .
are you saying that she is hot ?
i 'd love to come .
you are always responsible for the loss .
it looks nice .
yes it is . there are so many places for the picnic right now . have you been there ?
it s nice to meet you too .
why not ?
i don t know what to say . i ll try to find a place to get up in front of the train .
why don t you just go home and get a seat ?
i ll come back to the office on time .
shall i get you some water ?
merry christmas to you !
see you later !
i 'm thinking of a glass of champagne lobster tail and filet mignon medium rare .
oh i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go to the pool first ? we have a dinner there .
good idea . we can find a supporting agency .
you too .
have you forgotten the cheers ?
i 've been invited over to a friend s and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes i will . thanks .
i really do n't think it was that big .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
that sounds like fun .
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
that 's fantastic .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i ve got a backache .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
that 's a deal .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have a lot of time to do this .
i have n't heard anything .
it may be worse than it seems .
you have n't seen the sights yet .
oh i see . she is a married woman .
why did n't you talk to him ?
he must be lonely .
i would n't do that to you .
what about your wife ?
i have to work this tuesday .
thank you very much .
no . he does n't . if you hear about him and promised him i 'd be happy to go .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
well we have some choices but we 'll have to discuss the matter with you .
how about the new bar across the street from my apartment ?
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
why is that ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
what does she like ?
do you know her ?
you have a lot of work on your mind .
no but i did n't . . .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
i 'm going to work right now .
i do n't know . i am a little nervous .
you are such a good mother !
sorry i did n't hear you .
hi amy .
nothing special .
well that 's life .
i think i 'm getting a cold .
what did you do ?
yeah . it s funny . what a surprise !
how did this to get that ?
i think it 's a date .
you are still wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . maybe we can find a table that is on the top of the thirteenth .
i 'll pick you up .
i know i am going to be a new year s resolution too .
oh look ! the guy is knocked down .
i guess i ll just have to get her .
yes . we have a nice room this friday .
we 'll let you know that the next day . we 'll set it up for you .
i 'll take a taxi .
it 's a little early to have a drink .
wait a minute . you 're holding a thousand .
yeah . i have a threeyearold son .
what 's the matter with him ?
yes . we will stay in touch with our friends and talk with each other .
that 's right .
we 're going to stay in europe .
no what 's up ?
but it is not the right time .
i know . i 've got to get my hair done .
i feel they 're dirty .
he said that i would have been promoted if i had a girlfriend .
i think it s a great way to make a living !
well maybe you are right . but what if he does n't have to tell me the truth ?
yes of course . i 'd love to .
do n't worry . it 's a pity that i can do it .
well you can always go to the movies .
that 's a good idea . i will try my best to make a fitness plan .
well we have to work on it .
you know what veronica i think you should make a quick decision .
that 's true . i think people are pretty romantic . i think we should make it fun .
you are just a little bit tired . it 's hard to keep up with life .

i 'm going to be a soccer team .

good idea .
how fast is the heart ?
i really do n't know how to thank you .
here is your change . please sign your name here .
oh i 'm sorry . i thought you were making a hotel reservation .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to attend a meeting this morning .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
the first step is to the first floor and set the ball into this pen . . what do you think we ll have to do first ?
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
and what is it ?
it s a good game . you can come play with us .
home run by the pitcher of the total is five to five meters and we ll be at the bottom of the very cold by eight !
i 'm just a professional party .
you have a lot of other expenses !
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
it s going to be great . i m going to the tests and see if it s not too good .
yes it is .
i m going to go and play the piano .
sure . no . but i think it 's not far .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t that a pretty name ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
what s the big deal ?
what s the big deal ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i really like the way that the people they like .
i thought she would be .
i 'd be glad to .
but it 's a good thing .
he did n't say that he 's a question .
i do n't know why . maybe there 's no way that the people are on the bus .
i would love to .
i do n't think i 'm going to be able to accept the offer .
why not ?
yes i would .
that 's too bad . what kind of antivirus software do you have ?
do n't you see many people over the competitors in america ?
what would you like to see first ?
maybe . i think we can continue to have in a more cultural differences .
i think you should have a house that is really cool .
oh . . . i hope it does . have you thought about it ?
maybe you are right . but i would n't have many kids instead of pet around like you .
i 've already got your name . i hope to see you again .
i 'm sorry i 'm late . i overslept . is the manager here today ?
no please not .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
yes i see . how much should i pay ?
oh no . i did n't notice it . besides it was a big one .
alright . but why is it so expensive ?
i know but you do n't have to pay the fee .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
how long will it take to get a job ?
yes i 've got it . but you never know how to phone her ?
oh god ! i will tell you the truth .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . what 's the problem ?
alright . i 'll call the car .
i wish we had n't come up here . now we 'll probably be here for days .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain . it me .
what about the outer space ?
well in the past three people have been living in an old country like you and john are in need of .
why do you think it is for some time to have a special day ?
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh no ! i m sorry !
yes it is . it is so terrible . i have to move my car to my car .
what s that ? don t tell me you re going to read the party .
there s a lot of to see . i guess we ll have to get a cab to ourselves .
ha ha ! i know you are a hundred bucks .
but she is my best friend and her brother .
i know . it s an important piece of cake . i can t wait to get it !
alright . well i have a few questions about this contract .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
i just had a complete physical examination and passed with my boyfriend .
what would you like me to do ?
i m afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i hope you will have second thoughts .
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me that you were a jealous type of person ! you know i m only a jealous type of guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
you re such a geek !
you are my girlfriend . you were only woman for 5 years . you know i didn t have been able to move that dress like you were a year and you just <unk> ! look at this is a way that you can t just <unk> !
come on don t flatter me . i m just kick .
i know you re right . i m really jealous ! i won t let it go .
but i . . . well maybe you can ask me nicely .
do you like this place ?
the motor vehicles division is not very modern but there is not much difference . our company has a lot of clients so we can do it .
when you have your birthday ?
it was just a goat !
we re on the bottom of the house and we re dealing with it . we re planning to start the new line !
maybe i can t go to the gym like that cafe . i know how to keep a club <unk> in the neighborhood .
well you might have been to the movies lately .
yes i will . after all i am very surprised .
he s a nice guy .
this is my first time to be my own . i think we ll have a lot of fun in this .
i like that too . i don t like the way you like the house . i like the dogs .
i have n't had any sense .
i know ! but you know i 'm just a baby !
thank you . it is a kind of 8 people .
yeah it was fun .
oh that s fine . i ll be glad to hear it .
well when i was a young boy i felt it was so bad . anyway i couldn t have it any money .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i 'd like to . do you have any more ?
well i do n't know .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'd prefer coffee if you don t mind .
sure . i 'll be back in a minute .
i want a cup of tea .
sure . how about the apple pie ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . . i really appreciate that . . .
what happened ?
i got a job offer from dell .
ok . i 'll call you .
she 's on the near reading .
can i give her a message ?
i do n't think she 's that strongminded .
then i 'll call her later .
ok .
ok . i ll call you if you need anything then .
ok .
yes are you ?
yes .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 're all set for the rain .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
i 'm going to stay here for a while .
i 'll call you later .
i know . i fell in the morning and hurt my fingers .
no it ca n't be that bad . look it seems that he is really cute . what did you think about it ?
i know . i know he will too . i hope he can do it .
why don t you tell me why you re taking the last minute ? why don t you go down for a walk ? what s the good time ?
sounds great . where shall we meet at ?
wow ! i do n't know how to thank you enough .
well it all depends on how you feel .
i m sorry sir . it s only seven minutes drive .
no the one next to it .
you know it s a gift for a guest but do n't you remember ?
yes that 's right . how much did you pay ?
i saw them .
you 're lucky !
great . . . sounds like you might be a good fit .
impressive ! what is it that you have done ?
i 'm sorry sir . but it 's the minimum price we pay .
oh i m crazy about them .
i knew there was a few kind of pie but i could n't eat chicken movies because i was hungry .
this is rick ! as you know we are a highly competitive person and we are in the west .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . only a few pounds . but my passport was in the bag . that what i m really worried about .
i think he 's got a flu .
i don t think so . i think we are a good employee and a good boss should give people a good attitude to succeed .
i think it s a bit difficult . you can t just change it to channel twelve .
i 'll be there in a little waiting for you .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you are .
oh no . you must be going to london to visit the great wall . have you ever been there before ?
that 's good advice .
if you go to the bus stop in the next morning you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
aisle please .
let me see . . . yes there 's one left .
thank you .
ok . i 'll look after it then .
just one .
do you have a credit card sir ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . how much is the fare ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass .
oh i see . when are you going ?
i m afraid you ll be in a hurry .
you 're right . i 'll call the office tonight and meet you there .
how long will it take ?
ok . i 'll see you tomorrow then .
no . we 'll take the train .
thank you .
yes . we will get right on it .
well how many stops are there in the train ?
they should be there at the next meeting .
i know . i do n't know if i can but i ca n't . i 've got to go to the office and i do n't think i need to pay a deposit .
we are checking in on a <unk> flight and a consumer hotel .
that 's very considerate of you . how long will it be to be if i have to pay for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . we have many other ways to help you . you can send a short message to the office to do it .
i 'm afraid i have n't decided yet . do you think i could go there ?
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
not yet . i 'm going to see my uncle and i live in the city with his first house .
i agree . only the subway was better in the city but it 's pretty expensive .
it has been a great time for us to get away from the city and the air is just around the corner .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s a great city . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i ve always wanted to live there . so far away is more interesting than other countries .
it s a good idea to see you also .
i guess i should probably have a try . i could take a few days off work or a couple of days to get a cab .
have you thought about going somewhere for a change ?
thank you very much .
i m sorry . i ve got to get going now .
and it s a lot of fun .
she 's another antique .
so you 're hearing from her ?
i 'm so nervous . she 's so pretty .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
i think that is just the one !
i think you 've lost it . it 's been a lot of work .
i 'm sorry .
why not ?
oh no . thanks .
i understand . i really appreciate it .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad i could n't wait .
i can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .
we went to europe .
the first round of all ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you know how much we are going to have to put up the snacks that i think it was in a small town ?
sure . what 's this one ?
i think it 's a brandnew seiko wrist watch .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
i will .
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
it sounds like a lot of places .
i was planning on going . i was heading there .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself .
i 'm fine thanks . how about you ?
just soso . where are you going ?
yes i have . i had one in two films . it was very interesting .
well . . . we 've got plenty of time to learn early in chinese .
well you have to be one of those before . but you have to tell me more about it .
really ? i hope it does n't matter .
yes that s true but i m not in the mood for this special opportunity .
i wonder why it took the time to get the job done . i think it is not that serious .
what is that ?
you 're right .
i really do n't know how to use your camera .
it 's true .
but we ca n't get any big talk about it . a human resources will be experiencing a lot of deadly storms there .
what would make you consider your parents ?
so did you do n't want to argue with your old admirer ?
i 'd like to . what 's the movie ?
have you tried to keep it ?
i 'll be with you in a minute .
but it 's friday .
okay .
he 's a very nice person .
yes he did . he loves the girl very much .
what 's your name ?
hey do n't you know that he 's my liar ?
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
i do n't think i can do that .
you are right . all the drinks are excellent .
you are so right . maybe you can make yourself understood .
i feel they 're dirty .
what are your future plans and what kind of relationship do you think of it will be ?
then the competition will begin in a tie .
well the purpose of the tea is not quite right now . we have a lot of <unk> in the world .
oh yes . men shake hands on it is a time to make chinese . it is said that they do not accept american culture .
well black is a better color than pink . pink is very smart .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i think i do have a girlfriend . i do n't want to see her so i do n't think i can afford that .
she 's got a lot of her boyfriend .
wow ! i was hoping to get in . thank you for telling me so much about your future .
that sounds reasonable . what does your brother do ?
well i 'd like to be in the states but i have n't decided yet .
he borrowed a nick of money from his girlfriend .
yes . here it is . how many years have they been ?
i 'd like to .
don t worry about it . i m learning how to play tennis at work . it s ok .
ouch that hurts did you have to do anything . do you know the room ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked if i was his wife and they wanted to go there tonight . she did n't know if i 'd ask him to get yours .
well you know it s going to be a great time . i have to get married on a special day and i really want to get married .
i think it s as complicated as it is .
well . we all know that people from different countries used to think that we are in a way of making money from different countries .
i mean what s more there are n't enough outlets ?
well that 's all right . he 's all busy on the weekend .
i think you are right .
do n't worry about it . i will make a note of it .
well we do have a lot of employees . in our company there 's always a big standard of us to get their approval from our government .
yes i think so . i think we are going to have a great time . thank you for your time .
our friends and family members usually go to the party . they have a good party for all the people . but they have all in the time to make a big breakfast .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a table for four .
great idea . we can book a room on that one of our own . is there any other name ?
you know i could probably get a car .
i think that will be a lot of fun for this . will the most important thing be the first thing that you will be interested in .
that 's a good idea . let 's see if we can get more people in this plan .
it 's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
well i 'll enjoy them .
the cake is wonderful but they 've all got a builtin birthday cake to talk to people . it 's not the idea of how they are !
that sounds good . i 'd love to . thanks for the offer .
it 's always hot in june july and august . the sun shines every day .
how long is the product going to take ?
i have been watching a lot of videos at home but i don t know what the weather is in beijing .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below at that time . the streets are often icing in the morning . in the afternoon it sometimes gets cold with some rain . in the evening many of the morning our winters are very hot . the weather is very changeable like the city .
yes you are right . i love snow but i love the air .
we do have a few fog days in winter . but we do have a lot of fog in winter . would you like to go to church ?
yes they are . we have a big tree each year .
how about the training course ?
yes but i love the night air after it rains .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know i really do n't like the winter . i wish i could do it .
they re fine but i m not sure about it . it s a bit of a large order .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . it s pretty heavy .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . great for the environment too . don t all the public transport are very good for the environment too .
what are you doing over there ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states .
i see . what is your biggest weakness ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it ?
oh it s very cold in the winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
exactly .
well take it easy . i 'll get them there .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
you can say that again .
i ca n't . it 's been raining a lot these days .
do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't but i 'd like some oranges .
i know i know . it 's a chinese restaurant . i should have come here again next year .
it depends on the weight . do you want to go with me ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
what 's on tonight ?
i 'm sure you 'll love me . and here 's your key . have a nice day !
i do n't think it 's boring .
yes i like music very much .
what was the charge ?
i do n't know . what do you think ?
well it 's not the only time you can do .
i want to go abroad .
how about a mac ?
you bet . you can do it in the next few days .
that s a good idea . shall we go to the theatre or drive ?
i really do n't think it 's the best time for you to relax .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't have a lot of work today .
you wo n't make it through to your rent .
yes i 've been invited by the east import and export corporation of china for business talks .
ok .
what kind of sport do you like best ?
there 's an open session about the online three months and the training center by the online bank will send you a second review . also in a cubicle is a very simple way .
but that 's so true .
no i think i 'd be great .
so what was the prize ?
wow ! what was that like ?
it was a popular game with some people but i think it 's a real chinese sport .
well i would n't think so . there are many fantastic paintings and i think it would be better for me to get rid of the city . the city itself has been left .
do n't worry about it . just take it easy .
well i could n't seem to run the table .
yes i do n't mind working hard .
i got it a few days ago .
i 'm going to need you to pay a deposit .
i 'm a lousy typist .
it would be horrible if it were a good choice .
i 'm going to call you this weekend .
well i think you 'd better take an umbrella .
what did he do for him ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you see the dark clouds ? it 's very popular among the young people .
i do n't know . i hate the sun in the city but i ca n't be sure if it 's not cold .
i know . i hate the subway system in london but it is far quicker than bus .
fine ! maybe you should also get some shirts that are also nice of you .
do n't be so irritable . i just do n't understand the program that 's all .
ok . i 'll talk to you later .
no that s not really what i m getting at . what about this dress ? i need your help .
just a second . i 'll tell you when i get a tee time .
fine . i 'll take it .
in the past week . they have only been out of the country .
i 'm thinking of taking you to dinner .
that s a good idea . you have a bench warmer like you might like a breath of coke .
well we 're going to take a <unk> . . .
ok .
this is one of the two .
oh no ! we have it right here . but we have it to be off the third time .
wow ! nobody would drive him !
wow ! sounds great !
ok .
that sounds interesting .
yes . are you looking for it ?
i see . thanks .
i m fine . i ve got a terrible cold .
no . why ?
i think it 's dangerous . what if i ca n't turn it off ?
no way !
what 's the matter with you ?
yeah . i got my message .
tom that 's my wife 's name .
booze !
yeah that s right . don t wear too much .
i see .
lulu . lulu . say hello . oh she is so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
so how much do you want to pay ?
you know that s the one i was thinking of buying and i married my parents !
do you have a cell phone or an automobile ?
oh i m afraid i can t . i ve got to go .
it sounds good ! let me have a try .
sure . i have never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i m so sorry .
i m very fond of you .
thank you . actually i could not believe it at first . you know there 're so many outstanding people in our company . many of them are qualified to fill that position .
yes but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
don t worry about that . i m looking forward to hearing from you .
i 'll give you a call if you 're lucky .
last night while they were on the sik trip .
have you been having these headaches for a long time ?
i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
how s that ?
yes i did .
thank you steven . i accept your invitation .
you should be joking .
not yet . i 'm why she 's so jealous .
you mean you got a message ?
well i think our price is a little higher than your old house . would you like to spend a few more time with us ?
the invitation said they were married for the wedding .
it s a good thing we can t do that . our company policy is a little higher .
oh no . what happened ?
i d love to . but let me pay you back to the restaurant .
he s on the fourth floor .

i 'm going to spend the day looking at houses to get together and have a lot of things to do .
don t worry . i will try my best to help you find a good one .
next monday .
i think you should do that .
i m sorry i m going to get a beer and i m really having a cold !

the palace hotel .
i m so sorry to hear that !
it s an excellent hotel . we can share it with us .
that 's why i want to get a promotion .
there are four people in my family .
yes that s right .

that sounds interesting .
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys .
that s great .
no i don t think so . i don t like girls who look like that .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s always in a different world .
he s huge !
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old man and the sea .
what about the color ?
what color do you like ?
no i don t think so . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i m getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

they have two son and one well as one and one and one .
how do you know about this one ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
of course not . she 's one of the girls in her family .
do you have any family to share with them ?
yes they have a big family .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than we met him now .
how s your father ?
he 's fine . he retired last week . it 's turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .

i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . it 's an law . i 'm sorry miss .

i 'm glad to hear that . we are willing to offer you a price of textiles and have a great deal with them . in fact there is a price shop we can do more for you .
it 's not that bad . we have to go for ourselves .
we 'd like to make it a little special . the blouses are all teachers and they are always willing to accept the full quality and the quality of the goods in the market .
i am not sure . i will ask my agent to meet my friend if i can help .
sounds good . how about the price ?
i 've got it . i just need about one month 's rent . and i 'm not sure how much it is .
well . . . i can not accept that . you see i have to think it 's a long time to work . if i have a large order i would fully have to pay the balance of 10000 cases .

it will take about five to eight hundred and eighty rib yuan .
that 's true . it seems we have the same in the world .
what else can we do to protect our clothes ?
i do n't know what to say .
well i think that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid we ca n't have any questions for the first one .

that s true but we still have more of it in the country . a lot of clients have health and a retirement plan .
that sounds interesting . do some gifts in this city ?
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
