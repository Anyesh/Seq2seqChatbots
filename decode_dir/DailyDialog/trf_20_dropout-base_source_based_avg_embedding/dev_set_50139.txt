that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?

yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .

i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't worry about it . i need to have something done about those bushes .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .

not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
i m sorry sir . we will send someone to your room right now .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
if you do n't mind transferring to another room we may manage it for you . we usually have cancellations or noshows .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .

it 's quite actually . i 've been looking for it for quite a long time . do you think it 's much cheaper than mine ?
any place will be fine .
oh yes . it 's just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it on your left .

our restaurant is in the south of the city .

i need to go to the airport before ten . can you make it ?
it is so far .
thank you .
were you kidding ?
interesting . what if the average income groups are good at first ?
that s a good idea . let s see . . .
i have n't been to the theater in a long time . i just want to go to the movies .
no . i 'm afraid your sofa is too bright .
he was late for the party .
do n't take too long . let 's walk together .
i m afraid so . i m just going to have to call the police .
i think he did .
this doesn t sound too bad .
exactly .
are you nuts ! nobody told me you were so kind !
what did she say ?
that sounds alright .
i like that .
i could try that . it would be great to see you again .
ok . is the school of your family ?
i see . may i see your room number ?
but the price is too high .
i might be dead if i can t afford it .
i want a home inspection very much .
where to sir ?
the one made in the hotel .
it 's 12 . 15 minutes later the station is over there . do you have any rooms available ?
i have to be there before .
great . i 'll be at your place at 700 .
that 's fine with me . there is a first class going on trial . if i do n't think there 'd be some more lengthy discussions .
i 'll do my best .
i think that is a very good idea . how many years have you been employed here ?
usually it 's 12 dollars off the glass .
then i 'll be right back .
thank you .
yes here you are .
yes where to ?
could you please help me put my luggage here ?
are there tickets for the federal express ticket ?
if you 're hungry then i 'll go and buy a new one .

here 's ten dollars .
take the lift over there and turn left . you wo n't miss it .
you 're kidding !
here you are .
ok . if you could just give me your name and phone number i ll call you in a few minutes .
thank you very much .
hi . is there anything i can do for you ?
what would you like ?
oh is it ?
yes i 'm here to see the bank .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
sure . do you have a trainer ?
yeah . see you later .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they 're all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
i see . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
sounds good . do you think i could have a look at your passport ?
of course . but it 's just at 19 lingual . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . do you know the number of the waiting room ?
yes . i d like a room .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
yes . it 's . besides it is a spacious nonsmoking room with a view . the whole room is a kitchen and the bathroom . . .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back then ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the electricity is the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
that 's a long time .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
i know that . i am worried that the market is too high . if i ca n't deliver it with you you you you you have to be afraid .
i know . do n't you have any more space for me ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
you are right . i will wait .
but he studies for me . i always thought you were only ill .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
i do n't know . i never went to a church before . i was not raised as a christian so i do n't think it 's fun .
hello paul !
wow ! what a beautiful home !
i did n't know you were n't feeling well .
hello . i m feeling a little tired .
i 've been busy .
i 'm sorry sir . may i ask you for a while ?
thank you .
my pleasure . good luck to you .
see you later .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a worker .
what if a surprise ?
yeah . i think it 's funny . what if i put a little oil in it ?
that sounds like a good idea . the number of people in different countries are in different countries .
ok .
i 'll see you in front of the window .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
that 's exactly what i want to do . i am glad you are here .
no you have to . it s only seven minutes to make your car .
what !
all you ever think about food ! i know you could use a stylus to draw a map on a map on this map .
what do the sunroof in the car then ?
fantastic ! i m sorry !
well we can just throw them into the trash can . i want something like that .
cool ! i ll take it .
i m sorry . nothing is wrong .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
are you a sure ?
hmm . have you got a look at this one ? this is a good one .
what a pity !
i see . how about the olympic games ?
i 'll have to get one .
oh it is kind of you . thank you very much .
that s true . when would you like to purchase it ?
the fans are not very long . too hot and the air is also nice .
i know about that . i know why it s so cool in power that magazine .
. . . . and your clock trying . .
i don t know . i know why that little guy s pet ?
what 's it like lady ?
yes i think you look very nice .
there 's actually another problem with the problem .
here we are sir . you re all set . let s go under the tree and have a nice stay .
i know . i ll try my best to do the job well .
you are welcome !
i 'd like a half an hour early morning .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! how do you want to apply for the insurance policy ?
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
ok . thank you very much .
that 's all thank you .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
here s your key sir . your room is on the 7th floor . please wait a moment .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find this book .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
this is a new one .
what about the special effects of these ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but i bought it last month .
what is your aim in your work ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how do you organize and plan for major ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
the trainer tells me besides regular sports activities i should also have a good rest .
i think i will go and have a look at the newest 10 .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
thank you . that 's very nice of you .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
damn !
hi . i am here to talk to you about your company . is this the right counter ma 'am ?
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
awesome !
i was told to come in this morning .
this is the kitchen . you look so attractive .
can you tell me something about your background ?
i know what it is and i love the smell of gasoline with last night . it s so noisy that i can t get it .
can you come to the end of the month ?
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
you are right . this is the latest fashion .
i am sorry miss . i think we have made a few of pure silk .
how can you solve the problem ?
there . it s a piece of work . i can t wait to get rid of it .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it might be . sometimes we do n't need some less expensive clothes .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
oh yes ! the view is spectacular . but that is the house of the house .
we should have a few more . maybe we should do the shopping !
i have n't thought of that . i know it would be so much quicker than just a few of my pay .
thank you . i 'm glad that you 're here .
and how do you do miss that ?
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
what is the most important thing for you ?
it s a good thing .
that s not enough .
what will you do if you don t mind ?
i see . would you mind telling me how much you paid for your ticket ?
that s a great idea .
if you consider our high research costs and excellent quality we are very reasonable .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . you know i find it very comfortable in supermarket .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
this is a really good brand . i ve just come back from the kitchen .
i have no idea . could you show me the menu please ?
an ordinary one ? i prefer the brown one .
i don t think i ll take that one .
i don t think so . i m sure it s still well made .
what do you think of this industry 's outlook in the world ?
yes . there is a big yard for help . i can t wait to have it .
i like one black one .
all right . anything else ?
we are all right . we should rent the apartment with our relatives and friends .
great . i just need a few questions .
yes . good luck .
i m sorry . you can t ask anyone .
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make .
i 'll be glad to help you out .
i think that i can afford it . just one or i 'll need it .
i 'm happy to hear that . how much will it be ?
fine . i 'll be expecting you .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
you ca n't miss it . make sure you do n't go anywhere until you see what you want .
let me see your id and 27 .
thank you . i 'm sorry for the trouble you 've done this .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
i 'm sure it 's not my fault . i 'll take it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes i think that is the best part .
right . i know it would be horrible if we could watch a game last week .
i think you re right .
i told you to clean it up earlier .
that s all right . i m afraid it s got a dark cloud cover . i can t afford it .
i love the balcony . let s go shopping and see . there is a new one just around the corner .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i will take more .
yes we are my wife and brother . and brother and sister are doing well .
you can think of two houses that we have a very wide variety of discounts .
ok just fill in the direction of the registry . let s go !
i have to do something .
i see . i ll take it .
that 's my grandfather . my friend 's room number is a bit too small . it has a balcony and it 's a grandfather .
i like the bamboo design . what is this ?
i agree . i think we should just go look at the sun first .
that 's right . we will have to go there once a week .
that s the aroma of coffee beans .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hi this is the property manager . how may i help you ?
that s not my problem .
well i would love to move in . do you have any available ?
let 's go to malibu .
i am . i 'm looking forward to meeting you .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
i 'm afraid i have to get a cab . it 'll be too late .
we have a deal with the local news .
i 'm going to be ready to get my food done right now .
we might be providing hot dogs hamburgers and cake but people can bring side dishes .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
well i ve got a few useful website to help you with your requirements .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is . it has a brushed titanium metal body and a rubber shockproof <unk> case with a belt clip .
history .
that 's interesting . could you give any reasons for your choice ?
ok . do you have any plans for the new year 's resolution ?
yes .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
yes . it 's an excellent system . i 'm looking for the job of a company .
let me see it . oh the computer looks really good . i 'm sorry to have taken out . are you a new bird ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm trying to send you a check .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what do you think about the balance of the most ?
i know that in most asian countries apple is not very good at english . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok . please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . what about tomorrow morning ?
yes i 'd like to try the considerate .
oh really ? did you know it ?
not too long . but it 's a little tight . you have to wait for a long time .
if you like this person s short and your wife doesn t like it would make you happy ?
i hope so . i 'm not really into this style of this year .
you are very welcome . i think you 'll be a good candidate .
no you are just a little thin .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no i do n't really know about it .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
well done . i have been working on it for quite a while .
i see . well here 's the form . please fill in this form and label it .
thank you for saying that .
you can always make a sandwich or something .
okay . i 'll take a look .
yes i do .
here is the money . which one would you like ?
i am not surprised . i thought you had a cold .
let 's take a look at the pamphlet . i 'm sure you will find the weather .
oh i 'm sorry . but i 've got to look at that . this is our apartments in the neighborhood .
hey ! look at this ! it looks as if you can ! are you busy now ?
ok i have a great idea .
ok let 's go .
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
that 's great .
our computer lab is unfortunately we can not use it .
true . i think the most important thing is that i can learn from the holiday .
let 's leave the kitchen and get it back .
yes i have found the four samples . i am sure you could have them .
ok let 's go .
is that why a wouldn t you talk to them ?
where is it ?
i could n't find the files you request even though i checked all the crossreferences . i do n't think it 's there .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
ok let 's go check it out .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and an employee can only move one space for a year . it 's just not complicated .
actually there are many houses nearby . i think it 's impossible for a train .
ok . let me help you .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what 's the matter ?
i prefer sea food .
some of my friends say that boys are enjoying yourself .
not at all .
well it looks very nice .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
certainly . speaking of china 's mouth is a chinese wine . it 's a chinese wine .
actually i 've been thinking about it for quite a while . but now i 've got to be in touch with all my friends .
do you like some soup ?
you are right . i could n't do it .
what kind of food do you like to try ?
ok . i like chinese food .
it 's getting chinese you know not good . i like chinese food .
sure i know . but you must pay the entrance fee to the store where the monthly store is .
you know i have n't had any type of computer but i 'm hoping you could do it .
yes i know . i need some oranges . i hope they do n't like them . i need a recipe to buy some and a new suit .
oh i see . so what else do i have to do ?
you can see the job about a hundred and fifty cents .
rin ?
you re welcome .
we don t have any on sale yet .
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
i think you should give me some advice .
well we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement .
ok . what time do you close please ?
they are attending the conference in the united states .
are there many things online ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
you are right . but i like wearing a dog or a cat .
i do n't know . i 'd love to !
that sounds good .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i figure as long as the quality is concerned .
the most expensive little girls in the blond .
this one is good . i will take it .
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to put it in a few minutes ?
i think we should make it .
good .
yes i would like to check in .
sure . do you have the receipt ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . i 'll take it .
i ca n't . i am a grownup and i 'll come back to my office this afternoon .
go and try it on .
are you kidding me ? i bought a pair of shoes last week .
i 'll take a dozen .
ok . i 'll come back later .
ok . please wait a moment .
that 's fine .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you sir . in fact i am afraid i ca n't do anything about this .
i know . but she said she had an important thing to tell you .
i 'm sorry mr . johnson . my first order was a guaranteed reservation from our other companies to guangzhou . i 'm sorry to meet you .
here you are .
thank you .
i 'm sorry . i 've already been accepted .
i think the quality is a good idea . how about this one ? it 's made of wood and it 's very comfortable .
sure . what do you want to know ?
i am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
do i have any other choices ?
is anyone else sick in your home ?
i do n't have any other choices . do you have any other choices ?
oh o . k . where s that ?
it 's not that bad . besides i also think that these people can pick a nice place to eat the most .
yes . i 've always wanted to have a try .
my pleasure ! this tea towel s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
i will look forward to it .
yeah i got it . actually this is my first time here .
but you should have thought of it .
yes i will . thanks for your help .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
absolutely ! i bought this red underwear ! it was a great opportunity to demonstrate it !
i usually use chopsticks .
yeah you are right . all these are sixteens .
you 're right .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
mainly plastics . plastics aren t <unk> they don t break down easily in the environment so they should n't be thrown away .
last week i only tried a few minutes we had a delicious dinner that night and it is about time to throw a new dinner !
generally speaking i 'm from a asian country .
i remember that there is a lot of people who eat it .
it 's a place that is n't true .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
it 's very good and you have to be patient . the manager is relaxed and helpful . i want you to take a rest of the day off .
yeah i 've got to stay home .
it 's not your fault . they are really looking forward to it .
sure . why do n't you ask me for a minute ?
well i 'd like tea instead .
thank you you you you you are very kind ! i think i could use some beers right now .
sure . you will give me proof of their mistake .
it 's hard to say .
you 'd better take some medicine for a couple of days to make sure that you get some every day .
no thank you . coffee is very kind of you .
they are n't very fashionable you see . i 've told you i 'm going to quit my job .
sounds like fun . i 'll try that .
you 've got a deal !
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you want to cook some chinese dishes ?

i can t believe that .
the office is in new york .

this is the last time . if we start we 'll both have to get this straightened out .
which bus should i take then ?
i 'm in a really good mood actually . how about you ?
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
how are you finding your new boss ?
i have n't sir . do you know how to get there ?
when ?
no i do n't .
you have your own vehicle ?
i have n't . i used to be driving a car .
do you want one ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
that will be tough .
we can get both at the cafeteria .
how about it ?
do n't worry . we can always get off the bus .
you must have seen some other kind of bird .
i do n't think this is right .
well you have to wait for a few minutes . if you do n't have to wait for a computer i 'll call you .
i 'm not sure where to get off .
i am really sorry to hear that .
yes i mean it .
i am glad i did not mean you would n't .
i do n't understand why you did n't .
hi ann . this is a surprise . how are you doing ?
i 'm reading about a book in the city .
that 's great .
i 'm not sure what you mean .
i wish i could tell you i 'm more exciting !
i won a prize for a half at the sports century .
you like the food there ?
i don t have any idea . one of my <unk> i m quite sure i could find a good career .
well i am not sure if i remember correctly .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in a hurry .
you are right . is that all right ?
well i hope you 're right .
i 've been working for a company for the last two years .
i hope i do n't finish this paper . i wo n't get out of it . do you think it will be tomorrow ?
well i ve been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
really ? that 's terrible .
really ? oh what 's that ?
ok i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
thank you .
i said this is a first time to get up .
thank you . i 'll be right back .
yes . we have a very wide selection of job here .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what kind of are you looking for ?
are there any other clauses in marine policies ?
you re welcome .
my mother 's been ill and i had to stay at home .
what s the matter ?
i think i know because i 've got a better job .
but you re crazy !
oh my son is an allright guy . i have to go with you about that ?
i understand . but he may do it too .
i want to get a puppy for my son .
why ? what does he do ?
i have been studying english for the past few years .
i understand . i thought you had been working hard .
i 've thought about it for me . how about you ?
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
next month .
oh it 's a sitcom . i like the vanilla ice cream .
what 's your favorite computer ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they re not using the same as the market !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
i know . i 'll feel terrible with my stomach .
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to the lake and see what else can we do ?
how about this one ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well there s one thing .
what happened ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
you know that this is a good exercise . i tried to eat spicy food but it is a little expensive .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i know . i intend to eat a sichuan food . the chef is spicy and spicy .
what if we 're not busy then ?
i 'm fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm still in xyz company this month . when i was a kid you had better time i started reading it at the university of studies . i 'm still a friend of mine so i came here .
i used to go to the new year 's party in .
oh i see . that 's what i want to do .
let 's see . i 'm free .
see you .
do n't worry . i 'll have to call you back in a couple of days .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
i like it too . i am very happy to be able to learn english and skills .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i think i 'll try my best .
i think so . the most important thing is that you can write your name address and telephone number .
yes i 'm very shy .
no problem .
i 've never been to such a dirty restaurant and i want to start to use a restaurant .
well i believe you can stay there but you 'll have to go to the small school for a few years .
what do they have for the government ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
oh i see . thank you .
i think an number of people who are interested in work of history .
i love that suggestion . i 'll think about it .
we have a printed one .

you did ? but you 're good at making mistakes .
it 's so exciting .
i start washing clothes here . i 'm a bit worried about my lease .
it was n't as high as you did . your english seems a little different .

it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 .

i think i caught a cold .
how do you think about him ?
thanks a lot .

it was fantastic but i 'm going to be back home this mountains .
it was divided into two fields from different subjects . the most important thing was that i had was good luck .
what 's in them ? did you find any bargains ?
no i am afraid i am going to stay in bed early .
i 'll tell you about the cost of a lot of pounds .
but i do n't know how to take the medicine .
really ? how long has your sister been in the states ?
well i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
and how do i know her ?
and it also reminds me of the blue .
i think you 'll have to get the offer . do you have any other questions about your job ?
i think she 's as good as that .
i do n't know . i did n't have a bad cold .
i hope so . thank you .
yes i think so .
do n't worry . i know what happened .
i m not sure yet .
you are not interested in that .
i want to have a driver 's course in your class .
let me see . that 's the airport from the professor hall . may i have your name please ?
to tell you the truth it 's the most tedious course i have ever had .
that is the one i was worried about . i mean if i ca n't wait until the last two weeks i am staying in a company and i am a boss .
yes he does . he loves the girl very much .
i guess i have to get so excited .
i 'm sure you 're right . i just need to ask you something .
no because my english is n't very good enough .
yes . i was just wondering if you could give me some advice on the menu .
i didn t think much of that . i think i could have a look at the menu . what else would you like to have ?
wow ! it sounds like a lot of fun . but how can the microphone and taking part of the action ?
he asked me to beef up in the car .
do you think it is ?
a slow should make a long enough attention to your manner style of conversation . their conversation can make a good working environment .
oh i know . i will try my best to assist the position but i need to know more about it .
ok . i will go right now .
i need it . thank you .

yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
okay you 'll be in a minute .
the author was a happy figure . that 's the best picture i 've seen . it was written by the man in detective novels .
and the cast is really the best .
all right . we 'll do it later .
yeah that s what i was thinking .
i had no idea and look at these charges for movies ! i was just calling to see you !
i 'm sorry you have to leave so early .
yeah . how s everything going ?
it 's ok . did you get the new computer company ?

i think that is our policy .
umm . . . i need to think about this issue .
sure . julie has sent me a resume and she s also got the final review of job all the top photos of them .
wow ! when do you move in ?
i agree with you . they are very nice and the style is in style . but in this case there is a big issue of wood . it is the right person with the destruction of the rainforests . they are not thinking about the marketing . they used to be the leather belt for providing the sales . they are in the sales and plant life .
where are you from ?
what are you doing now ?
then you must have a try .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !

i 'll have to stay in bed for two days and i 'll go to bed .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
i know that . but i can not find out .
yes . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there are so many here . i ll call you .
you are very lucky . you must be very careful .
it 's right over there .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i 'm sorry . i have n't been working for the past few days .
what 's the problem ?
i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
oh is that all ?
yes . do you have your receipt ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
my major is english . i go to the university of hawaii for two years .
i think you are right . i ll be glad to do it .
i m sorry to hear that . i guess we need to work as a professional would do .
i remember that . i think that we had a good time to work with .
i could stand to that . we could play together or get away from working .
it seems that we should learn something about him .
what about the problem ?
that s so true . do you have that in the meantime ?
i think that s true . i m not sure i know what it s just a policy of boss .
he is a hard worker .
very well . thank you .
how was it ?
i would like to return this book .
what do you need me for ?
i need to make a withdrawal .
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot to do that .
i m afraid you re being too particular about your food .
they are on special this weekend .
i think so . thank you .
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the <unk> is amazing !
are you sure about that ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it is a popular game with some people . many people like them because i 'm fond of playing it .
is that building a perfect cube ?
i don t know . the area of the building is a perfect cube . look at the building . so it looks like a building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a chance that you can go to the training center ? that is a perfect cube . i have a lot of fun in the building .
i m just looking for a black leather belt for my husband .
oh i m sorry . you know we ve been invited to a party this evening . there s a lot of people in this city .
why do you think of this one ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to have my hair cut .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
you need to take care of this video .
i do n't know what to say .
yes i am sure . i bet someone stole it .
you honestly have no idea ?
i 'll buy it for 2000 .

you can t think of anything ?
thank you .
i 'm sorry . you 'll be leaving for a meeting until 4 o 'clock .

i think that would be better .
i 'm going to see a doctor . i think i 'll have to get up to the office to get up to work this afternoon .
what time will the library be ?
we are at the cafeteria . i think you need a space for this .
well you have to wait for a few minutes . if you do n't have to wait for a computer i 'll call you .
thanks . who do i do n't want to do that ?
thank you very much sir .
that sounds easy enough .
see you .
but why ?
i 'd like to buy some books for myself .
what is the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
how about your nose ?
i 'm going to refund your money right now .
you can say that again .
sure . what is the classes ?
you 're lucky ! when i was little i had a conversation with that i wanted to be more careful in writing .
thank you very much .
you can still remember your note .

well there are several private companies that can take in an additional benefits package .
ok shall we make a coffee first ?
here 's your money .
yes but go on the third floor .
i 'm sure you 'll do fine . you can get a good picture of the test .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here 's a twenty .
we 'd like to pack it to three days . which country do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ?
i 'm serious . you should n't be surprised . the manager always tells a lot of people to take the company for the university and everyone is not interested in her .
that 's horrible . i knew that you were the first person to decide this .
no . i think it 's boring .
yes . what can i do for you ?
ok . shall we have a cappuccino please ?
i 'll take care of the lunch then .
i 'm not sure if i could pass it .
yes . the mirror is behind you .
sure . just a minute . i ll get her this finished .
well it 's very tall .
yes . especially in autumn the winter .
yes they look nice .
that 's horrible . i 'd be happy to hear that .
i think i want to try it on .
thank you .
of course . you can . i have my textbook and you can imagine what you want to know . .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
that 's what i 've got to do .
they are all right . they are the new models .
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
here 's your ticket and change .
by the way what 's the time we have during the 90 day ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it and come back again .
i think it 's going to be a lot of fun . what do you want to do ?
well i was born and raised in london . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics .
the most important thing is that you need to make sure that you do the same thing .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i have a little white cat but my sister has definitely turned out her career and she has to be independent .
they must be good . i can only read the subtitles . the <unk> is excellent .
how about a china vase ?
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i 'll leave you a memo .
do n't worry we 'll soon be celebrating something .
i liked computer games .
dad ! i must be finished an hour long time !
not really . the final offer went twice a week .
thank you .
we 're doing well .
i see . the chinese teachers are the same as usual .
we 'll have this doctor 's appointment with our director and have this weekend .
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i 'll leave you a memo .
our company will be held next month .
i 'm a student . what position did you do ?
i need to know about the fees you ve been doing .
do you feel like having a fever ?
but you 're going to be kidding me .
why don t you try a new one !
they 're just directors who are confident and quick .
what were your scores at last night ?
yeah . i will .
you must have a high iq score .
i need to make a withdrawal .
do you have your library card ?
i have it .
what ?
i d like to do that .
i ll just cancel your account right now .
do i need to take the test ?
now you should open this suitcase .
here you are .
what ?
what happened ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i am really tired .
that s all right .
because i want to know about this position .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
no i don t think she will do such a thing .
i can t wait to see him .
sure . but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun while he is more like this .
but i like its color .
what about this one ?
how about this one ? it 's graceful in style .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i 'm sure you 're right .
because of the most popular idol in this country it was the best in my country .
what does he do ?
do n't worry yourself too much .
i know that you should change your mind and say hello to your father .
wow ! how about taking a shower ?
yes . the train has a crowded bus .
come on . it ll be great to see you again .
you seem to have it down . i m sorry sir .
do you have your cell phone with you or call the office ?
have you made a hotel reservation ?
that 's true . some people go crazy for women .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
it is because of your son who is elected .
so what 's the problem ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry i thought you knew .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you know i could take a picture of you to make sure that your friend needs it .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
that sounds great .
hey do n't be so pathetic . what 's your opinion ?
what 's your favorite ?
i do n't know .
well that 's fine . i 'll take it .
i 'll let him know that .
so what do you do ?
you are expected to go for a horror movie .
how did you know that ?
yes but i bought it at the dressing room .
it 's too bad .
why ? what 's the problem ?
these ? they 're right .
sure . it 's a bit tight .
i see . do you have any ideas about your your photos ?
i 'll take a dozen .
you are kidding !
do you think you can talk to her about your mother ?
i know they are too shy .
of course not !
i do n't think i am in the mood for a californian .
i hope that he brings change to america .
i think you know what i 'm going to get for yourself .
what ?
a girl of mine is n't here at all .
hi linda i 'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
she 's a friend of amy .
that 's a good idea . let 's take the course .
i like her idea . she 's a nice girl .
oh shut up roy .
i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy that she 's doing okay .
of course ! i did . i hope my parents moved to me and they did .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
yes . mr . white has just arrived in scotland .
maybe i can help you with that .
i ca n't help you .
i guess he is n't expecting you .
when did you come to your last position ?
why is that ?
you 're right . i 'll change it . please tell me the reason .
what would you like to see ?
how could it be ?
ok . i 'll talk to you later .
yeah i 'm afraid so . i 'm in a hurry .
yes i do . i have to finish this report for a conference . it s so nice to be around noon .
no . i do n't think it 's so much of a things .
i did n't hear of it . here 's the receipt .
how many people do that ?
did he do it right ?
i 'm sorry i have n't been getting a cold .
you must be joking . the ball is green .
i 'm not imagining it . finally it was the first time i 'm afraid . he had to walk to the hospital . he had to walk .
well it was about a family s character . she got a real kick out of the heat .
oh . . . i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do for you ?
all right . i 'll have an appointment with me at 7
i do n't think so . i do n't think we have a very good time here .
i 'm so sorry taylor . i guess you 're right .
mrs . thou ?
it 's not just that . we have to put up with it .
well the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge . i left the airport three hours later than i expected .
i 'm so sorry i did n't think you were taking you .
i did n't think of that . she was also very kind of you .
oh how did it happen ?
yes . i think i am able to take the test again in a few years .

they must be just happy you are .
sounds ideal . we 'll wait for the workers !

i really do n't think that i will . what do you do there exactly ?
i really like the seats . they 're about jumping in the middle of the world .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
yes . do you want to go out to celebrate your honeymoon ?
that 's great !
what was that you just said ? you got the ones on the bottom . . .

i fell down and hurt my arm .

i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm very sorry .

and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
ok . i 'll be expecting you .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . i know . let 's go .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
i think that 's a good idea . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
what s the problem ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it 's a new one . i like it very much .
what about the performance ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect !
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's 42 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
actually there 's a great play . i heard in the play pingpong race where we can play a really well .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
i 'll call you later .
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise i 'll pay you back on monday .
i do n't want to .
well why do n't you ?

i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
i appreciate your help .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
i was late for school . i forgot to get off work .
i was really sorry to hear that . i could not believe it .
do you think i believe the story like that ?
certainly . what do you want to know ?
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
no problem .
i wrote a check for 100 and it bounced .
then when did you stay up here ?
no that 's it .
i 'll take it . how would you like to pay ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
well we 've made a few friends from south america . here 's your change .
well i 'm glad you took my order . i 'll be back in a second .
my pleasure . see you .
sure . do you have any more beer ?
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
do n't mention it . it was very kind of you .
we have a coffee or tea . do you serve tea ?
i think it s a lovely dress . i like the color and it goes really well with your skirt .
yes here you are .
thank you .
not today .
you can only have a money .
yes i like the color . i would like to try it on .
but i have to be back soon . i 'll call the police as soon as possible .
it is . speaking . how can i help you ?
hello . i want to speak to your director of human resources .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . look the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here then again here .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
how can you do that ?
i know . i really did not pay attention to it .
that s alright . i ll see you later .
oh how about restaurants and entertainment ?
does it close at that time to get there ?
we should be able to fit our clothes in the market . if you buy more you will be fined 20 yuan for the new room .
i think that is a miracle that no one was killed .
i was hoping you would come to a party this afternoon . if you like i can go to the butcher s and buy some chicken for you .
how much is the tape record ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you tell me about this ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long is the warranty ?
it s a bit . but i m afraid it will take at least a few minutes .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
just one of my strengths and some cash .
i know but i was late on the phone . i forgot to call the police as soon as possible .
that s great . do you think you re taking the job ?
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i care for you . i hope you will have a nice flight .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well .
you think ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
it s a good thing .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you .
great ! i can t believe it ! wait that was the second speed limit .
are you interested in this place ?
oh i 'm afraid we will be late .
no . i will try my best to calm down .
i feel great now .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
i am <unk> with a warning . i just need to get a new one !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . why is that ?
no this is the second time to be honest but if you really want to keep it from us on your business trip you will be ok .
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
i 'm not sure . let me see . yes i think it 's fine .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m sorry sir . but how long have you been in to pop music for ?
are you kidding me ? i m trying to watch the game !
well i have to decide which gifts to take all the time and then i to go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
impressive ! so what are you doing to do about this ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
you mean you could come play the game with the ball ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget and forget to forgive you .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how do you feel about this ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
do you have any plans for this interview ?
no i forgot to buy some .
have you got any statement for your debit card ?
you re a chicken !
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
i know ! but you re a fever !
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i m sorry but i can t see the doctor s . i have to go to the hospital .
i really love you too .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think i need to get a few clothes as well .
i think that s what i m looking for . i don t want to get a good apples and a pair of flowers . i think it s time to buy a new pair of clothes !
i think you should get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you just don t play . i know i might be a little too <unk> .
tell me what you want to know .
what are you talking about ? i just want a good physique with weights and carpio .
yes . you really deserved this .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
i am sorry i just ca n't find you . this way please .
alright mom ! i m gonna catch a cold .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of training in your mind ?
well first of all you can ask for attention . i ll be honest if you want to keep your promise from me a higher position .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still love this kind of noise when i am cooking . sometimes i even feel kind of tired .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and and and and and and and people kept talking with them . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time i said i was <unk> .
do you have any other outside income from one or two people who are interested in it ?
what 's that ?
it 's a taiwanese doll .
no . i was n't thinking about it . i 'm still a bit disappointed .
i feel like celebrating something exciting ! let 's go have a beer and the game is under the pressure to be a great time .
you deserve it . i 've been working so hard .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
we 'll take you to the conference center then we 'll just go to the bathroom .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us .
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
well you d better get some rest .
i 'll do that .
i think i know because i 've got a better job .
you know . . . like say god is the creator of the universe the bible and jesus christ . . .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i 'm not really going to get a kick or a small women in the resort .
it 's not your fault . but it 's the end of the world . and i know you 'll always be so different .
you 're right ! she must be very excited about that .
well you are right . what if the pet comes up to you ?
it must have been love at first sight because i know he had a girlfriend last week .
but i really ca n't accept your words .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .
what do you think of these places ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
that 's a good idea . do you know you can get a clear picture of your license ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
no . you can play computer games online right ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
i know . i 've tried some new coffee the day .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
i 'm hungry .
why not ?
how about going to italy next summer vacation ?
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid not . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i really hate this weather .
what do you think of the idea ?
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
you re a naughty boy .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem . i 'll ring you up over .
i 'm sorry sir . but you must have to wait for a few minutes .
to be honest i 'm really not really sure .
i see .
i am so sorry i did n't mean to have bothered you .
i want to try so . thank you .
what about tonight ?
are you busy ?
it 's a taiwanese doll .
well there 're so many things to do . i know what to do .
i know it is a reasonable neighborhood .
okay . i 'll call you later .
how was your game today ?
just watching tv .
i 'm sorry i 've got to go .
do n't worry . you 'll be fine . first of all you need to get yourself a new english teacher . next time you 'll be in a few minutes .
i will . but let me know if there is anything wrong with it . it 's the work i have to be late .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
i 'll give him a <unk> .
here you are .
great ! could n't be better .
sure . it 's my pleasure .
how about some fish ?
thank you .
you re welcome .
it 's ok . thank you .
yes . you really deserved this .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
it is very quiet and peaceful .
i got it from an .
i really do n't think this weather could be so good .
look at that they have a lot of fun . they should be used as new year .
yes i did . my family used to take me to dinner for my father when i was in university .
i do n't understand .
i 'm from work .
i see . is she your niece ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
oh that 's too bad . what does he have ?
no . he 's so cute .
i think it s amazing how to design a good environment and clean .
i think that most people experience this kind of exercise .
you know the ones that are on the shelf .
i guess you 're right . so i guess the reason is that we are too extreme sports .
well i guess you can give me some advice . you can always keep the kitchen god from work .
you have to be a politician . it s hard to be honest but those who play basketball .
sorry i 'm just impossible .
oh i watched the movie last week . it was really a kind of fun .
i like lotus .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . i can explain it .
yeah . do you know what you like best ?
what 's it like ?
thanks . i 'll see you later .
what color do you like ?
how long have you been on your head for ?
i would n't do that . .
i ca n't bear it .
a friend of mine was the best choice of sightseeing in china . the world of technology is a general concept for a general majority of people who care of the nation .
that s all right . we all have a printed variety of countries and we can learn a lot from it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i see . here it is . you have to go to the medical center and the entire package has a few different conditions and expect you to take the whole city to the right direction .
yes . you really deserved this .
that s good . what are these four ?
yes i mean it .
yeah you must be my <unk> .
do n't be silly . i am just a little nervous .
oh there is a beautiful view . the view is really charming .
it was a little small but i had to be back in about five minutes .
he had a lot of nerve telling you to do the same thing .
oh it was a lot of fun .
it sure is .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
that s not worth it .
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
that 's right . but i am thinking about getting a good chinese .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
well . i once worked in a small stock exchange . my work is very simple .
he 's a brilliant scientist . i 'll give it a try .
i have a lot of other shows . i 'll take it easy .
let me see . oh that 's a mystery novel .
that was quick !
i will be done by friday .
how about the fight fight ?
you know that maybe we could find a classical one . you should do it for yourself .
she 's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
what did he say ?
i agree with you . he just likes to play the piano .
so what did you do ? how did you meet him ?
i 'm sick of doing other people 's job .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we 'll talk to each other and make sure they get together to the new year 's resolution yourself .
i 'd love to .
sure i 'd love to .
sorry i 've got a meeting in half an hour .
yes she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
everything is 25 off .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
so want me to finish it on time ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
well you have to wait for a few minutes . if you do n't have to wait for a computer i 'll call you .
are you kidding ? what 's the point of it ?
really ? i heard that some people in england are very informative . however many detective stories ?
merry christmas .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books are exciting and far too expensive for me . i like reading books best .
i m afraid you re pretty sure about the interest .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
well that 's nice but my favorite movie is very just that i 'm a beginner .
so what do you do for a living ?
i 'll take you to improve your english .
so what are you doing for the hard work ?
it 's for the right drive .
how do you intend to do that ?
if you do n't drive it will soon be . if you do n't have to go straight from the station you will get on your rent .
yeah .
really ? i want to go too .
the bigger they have them now .
oh let s see .
no i think harry will get it .
you mean that people share the same ?
that s amazing .
i hear it 's worth it .
i could n't agree with you more .
why do n't you go ahead of the tree ? it is very interesting .
no what about his husband ?
that 's right . is there anything else i can do ?
i do n't know . maybe it 's a little teddy bear .
yeah i do n't know . but my fiancee has a <unk> on her .
i think so . you ve got to be a good politician . he was ready for it .
yeah i agree . i m really an overall fan of using my new technology . it s not an informal evening it s all about telling a woman from an art class . it s not an art lover !
yeah people do n't like to be afraid of people . do n't you know only tend to strike a day or more people ?
is it true that we have been in line for more than 200 years ?
she 's probably just got a sweet tooth .
i see . does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
she 's a real alright ?
no question !
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes our guest team is really tough .
they sure are .
i will .
hello is doris available ?
hello is that miss smith ?
my name is bill . how are you doing ?
what 's it like ?
belknap .
what 's it like ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the score was 10198 .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
thank you . mr . smith .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t really care about that .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .
the other team lost by three points 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
i 'll give you a call as soon as i find out .
just watching some tv .
not much . i 'm just relaxing today . why do n't you come with me ?
but you 're just so negative .
he must be very sad .
i think he 's the only person who can do .
what 's wrong ?
okay . i 'll think about it .
it 's just that he is a hard worker . they have the same to be around here .
ok . bye .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center of the city .
the score was 10198 .
hmm . that must be the dvd player who stands in the world .
oh do n't worry . you can do fine .
you said it .
yes . you 're lucky it 's the same name . that 's the top magazine for the right .
yeah . he is going to move next to his house .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
this is a beautiful town .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at <unk> .
give me a chance .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour now ?
right . there are two of us .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
is everything ok ?
i 'm here on business .
that sounds great . i 'd love to try some chinese food .
actually i am interested in the field .
oh very close . maybe 5 minutes walk .
yes i think i can help you with it .
good luck .
thank you .
i would like to go back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
no have a nice day ! have a great day !
i did . i liked it very much .
i understand . but why did you leave your last night ?
yes i liked it too . yes but it was really scary .
you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you but people will respect the fact that you are not the right person .
hello paul !
wow ! what a beautiful home !
i did n't know you were n't feeling well .
hello . i m feeling a little tired .
i 've been busy .
i 'm sorry sir . may i ask you for a while ?
thank you .
my pleasure . good luck to you .
see you later .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been uh . . . fifteen minutes .
i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a worker .
what if a surprise ?
yeah . i think it 's funny . what if i put a little oil in it ?
that sounds like a good idea . the number of people in different countries are in different countries .
ok .
i 'll see you in front of the window .
i 'll be there .
i like to listen to the movies . you do n't know much about it .
i do n't know . i like it .
what ?
i like feature films best . how about you ?
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
it sure does ! actually we could use a different credit card if you purchase it with us !
no i do n't like him . he s a gay dog .
ok . let 's go .
i am very tired and i feel that the weather is so ideal .
oh we had a lot of time . we were together for almost an hour and i missed it .
i think you are right . the boss gave me a list of problems .
not much . i bet i was born and still a child .
yes . he is the president of the company .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
did n't he crash ?
i got it from the cafeteria .
really ? you look so pale .
it 's a shame !
oh . what a surprise !
i think i know because my friend was seriously ill . i could n't fall asleep .
did he leave when you left ?
what 's wrong ?
i guess so .
i think i know because my friend is seriously ill . i had to get a good one and i simply told him that i could do it myself .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
i do n't think so . he only says he was just a boy .
yes . i 've heard about that . is it a good deal ?
well i love going to the concert . then i was going to clean up my room .
great . i 'll have a try .
he 's very easy . but i can understand his little bit . and i 'll bet you had a good time .
yes but it 's very convenient .
how much do i need to pay for the card ?
that 's great ! do you have some courses on the paper ?
i 'm having a party this saturday night . i want to invite you to dinner .
what 's the problem ?
yeah . i heard that she 's a possibility of a leading a blind designer and always tells a customer to be a bit more sensitive .
i had to leave the bathroom and the bathroom afterwards .
have you fallen in love ?
yes . she is a teacher of aerobics .
i wanted to see the statue of liberty too .
i had a good idea to help him .
oh he asked me to beef up in the work .
it was a pleasure seeing you again !
delighted i was able to help .
i think so . let me get my wallet . it 's very kind of you .
and how could you do that ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
well i m very happy . i ve always dreamed of going to get a new one .
yes .
ok . mr . smith . this is your key . if you need anything at all please let me know .
see you !
sure . actually it 's a cultural experience for when it comes to a state .
is that right ? the face always make a face .
what 's the matter with the holiday ?
how many chinese people are held here in the world ?
yes . i think it is a regular one .
it 's not the same as i did . this is n't the best standard for me to risk i 've been thinking about doing a lot of business for me .
why do n't you try this one ? it is the best seller 's business .
ah . that 's too far .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
good . let 's go .
it 's a surprise !
yes . i agree . those two kids are very talented . it must be very interesting to see a doctor .
there is one just around the corner .
and which direction were you going ?
the party starts at 8
fine . i 'll be ready for you tomorrow afternoon .
i know . i 'm really hungry .
i 'd like to go to the railway station please .
i 'll wait .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
good ! i 'm sure you 'll love it .
oh thank you ! that 's very nice of you to meet you .
all right . i m afraid this suits you very well . it s very hot and it s got a builtin piece of design . it s very reliable . i will take it .
i hope so . thank you .
when is the reservation ?
the festival is a of art in sydney . it 's a general name of the 10 of the world and the united states . there are people there any group group group display rooms that are included .
that 's great . it 's so helpful for the family .
i have an plans right now . so how about happy for you ?
and what 's the problem ?
that s the policy .
ok . keep my face here !
then the guest will be prepared to accept a holiday in the united states . that will allow you to stay in the united states .
well i like it too . it seems that the real world is n't it ?
i will .
well you are right . we can go to a horror movie and the subway station is about a mile from the square . just leave it to the zoo for me .

yes . there is a service charge .
we do n't know about that . it 's not a very expensive apartment . it 's about 20 or more .
i know a great place to hire two people .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's the price tag say ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how do you feel about this ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .

please do n't be so glad to be of service .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to have a experience and talent partner .
it 's a very beautiful taste and the music is so attractive .
no i do n't often dance . but i like pop music .
yes you can dance the music well .
that 's all right . that 's probably why i can put it in the other place .
well that 's too much of the environment !
yes . it says here that the poet 's society is today .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
generally speaking rice is the only reason for its popularity . many people have been left the state and will want to <unk> the health insurance .
i m sure that i m doing a good job on a computer and i don t have much time to share with my computer skills .
let 's see . he has a very good ear and all the back of the world .
you see the point ! in the issue with the cover of its articles in the markets is very reliable .
it 's a beautiful place .
yeah . i like it very much .
well how about this ?

i 'm glad you like it .

i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i do . but i 'm a terrible dancer and i have n't seen you for a long time . what about you ?
i 'm sorry but i 've already been busy . i will write to you once i get back to you .
i see . i 'll give it a try .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices .

i would n't mind having one myself .
what kind of exercise do you think i should do ?
yes it is . it 's nice and warm in autumn .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
i want to know what kind of teaching style do you have ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what 's the matter now ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
thank you .
i am very happy to hear that . but i am not sure whether it is or not .
me too . i 'm always in the mood for a while .
we 'll see you in beijing after summer .
oh i like the weather . it 's nice .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it will be held at nine o 'clock .
that 's a very good idea . how long is the flight ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i see . well how about the olympic park ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
great ! let 's go !
that 's true . i love flowers it .
let 's have it .
the weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to know what 'll happen .
yes .
what was the weather like in beijing ?
oh i forgot !
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no need .
oh i 'm sorry .
i 'm really sorry . i thought you would be a good candidate .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . this is your key . i 'll check it out .

and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
we re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
what 's the matter with you ? you 've made a good choice .
i 'll pick you up by then .
yes . i am . what 's up ?
what 's the weather like in the kitchen ?
i 'd like to very much .
you can get to the sports hall at the new entrance .
oh really ? perhaps i should have a try .
this morning . i mean . .
ok we 're waiting for you . let me check . yes we have a seat available .
thank you . see you later !
it is a very popular game because i love it .
i love it . it 's very interesting .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
some people are quite informative and many people feel the fresh and fresh breeze .
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many many many times . and there is no problem with the net maybe . it 's so slow .
how long has it been on for ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i would n't do that .
that 's all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know but you really should have thought of it .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
i am sorry i can t help you .
you re welcome .
you will .
oh yes . i could n't find my friend 's name .
really ? does he know that he was also a good president ?
yes he does . he likes the most handsome one .
would you like to be seated at the airport ?
because i like the snow very much .
you must have got a point . the original price of the total is 36 . 00 .
then i 'll try to catch it .
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
if there 's a possibility for you to be out of the day and you 'll be doing the same thing .
this is a good party . i 'm afraid i have to be a better time .
i 'm afraid this summer is a little too hot .
i am so sorry .
they re all here .
that 's right .
yes my father and brother are doing the same .
you too !
it 's a pleasure .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
you 're welcome . goodbye .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
you are welcome !
that 's pretty much like it .
but i just want to give her some tips .
yes . . .
that 's not true .
you are a good one . you can make it for me .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me .
ok let 's get together a couple of days next week .
i know life is not all roses and i believe i will pull this through .
the problem is that the doctor says you can get a good sleep .
i think it is very difficult to explain . in fact i can make good preparations .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . it 's really a good deal .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
why do n't you go sightseeing ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
you re right . you should be there some time .
i think it might be a little too cold for me .
yes . they are just opera costumes .
how do you think of this industry 's outlook in five years ?
which one has this made of ?
i know but i bought it to be sure i know but i was a very good girl .
it 's a job at a recruitment agency .
very interesting . that 's really nice of you .
yes . but he 's not a girl who had a bad cold .
the brown one ?
all right . please wait a minute .
well i think you should go to the movies this weekend .
i think you should go to the movies .
first i heard that we only go for our prepare . that is the best we can do .
i know . i could do that . you give me some advice on where i go .
all right . let s rock n roll .
yes i know but you know it is hard to quit smoking .
i 'm serious . you should n't be surprised . the manager always tells a lot of people to take the company for the university and everyone is not interested in her .
i do n't want to .
oh come on . you 're right . too much or too much of a lost .
no . it 's not very much .
not really . i just ca n't remember where to put it . it was a very beautiful song .
i also know him .
i know but i think it 's time to pull out the ring from the windows . .
yes they are . i bought them last week . they were not really all the latest design .
oh gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i ca n't bear it anymore !
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them they could have all been killed .
i see . can i pay by credit card ?
i don t think you re telling me that you re the best .
sure i 'd be glad to . what do you need ?
yeah . and i d like to have a few meals .
the next bus will be here in four minutes .
oh i see . did you study at school ?
but i have to write it down .
thanks a lot .
i need to buy some clothes for the family .
alright . i am looking forward to seeing you .

about half an hour .
that 's too bad . what about her hair ?
she lives in the city .
no i didn t sleep well last night .
why did you go to the cinema ?
yes i have one .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?

oh it s very good .
i like you . do you have a credit card ?
thanks a lot .

sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what s he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes people say he 's the <unk> young man .

how long will it take ?
i think they are all pretty good .
yeah i will . but my mother says she will be working like a night .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you think you are taking a break from the office ? she might have the baby .
i hope so . thank you again for saying so .
i could n't have been completely honest with you . but i want to be a lawyer if you do n't have a problem with your wife .
don t worry . it s just that there are a lot of issues to work with .
oh that 's right .
i ll but i can t . i have to stay home late .
yes i have two rooms left .
why did you stay a student ?
i have n't decided yet .
ok . this is a long time .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . our offer will be extra for the people who can handle it and the local market is quite a big location .
yes i 'd like to .
my advice is to know what 's your secret .
all right . if i win a lot of people will be losing their attitude .
how come you have a look at it ?
but he 's really tired . sometimes he 's bad .
yeah .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's 24 for each month .
why did n't he make a get of it ?
she wants to be a manager .
yes . i have already given her a chance to go in with her in the end . i would never want to be a late time .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
it 's very hard to say .
what are you thinking of ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we have a good pay .
how do you feel about this ?
he 's really reserved normally . but from what i hear he 's got lots of problems .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 've got plenty of time .
i really appreciated it .
it 's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
nothing much . i m going to the cinema on friday night but that s all i have planned .
i 'm a professional party planner here in the city . i do n't know what to say what to say .
it 's a good idea to have a walk in the park .
i like it and it 's a fast meal .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
great ! that 'll be ahead of schedule ! good work .
i do n't know but i do n't know how to express myself . i do n't know how to use the express ones .
do n't be silly .
well i would like to go but i was thinking of seeing you .
i 'm going to clean up the table .
i will do that right away .
yes sir . the fitting room is this way please .
my mom says it 's a great meal .

sure i have a date already .
i 'll do that .
i 'm sorry . i did n't hear your voice .
thank you . no . i m full for dinner at my house . i really have to go .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
what about the weather in boston ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
hi lily ! how is everything ?
yes . i love it too .
i have lived here for twenty years .
that 's a long time . how long have you been in the company ?

how about a cup of coffee ?
all right . is there anything else you 'd like ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i have been busy too .
about two years .
you speak chinese ?
for the past 5 years i have been in the u . s . s .
we are going to take a job this semester .
i 'm majoring in english .

you are always so kind . thank you .
you should always go to the movies .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm honored to know you .
pretty well . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no thanks . there 's no parking sign .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i would n't say that . it 's like there are so many excellent dishes .
by the way do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it 's very beautiful and the result is n't too cold .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i have never had one for myself .
well i guess you re right .
whatever . have you got all the dishes ?
she 's pretty . she 's pretty conservative .
you must be joking !
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
that 's too bad .
yeah . everything is fine .
she is a good friend and a great girl .
i think he has the flu .
how can you do that ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i stay in bed for one day and i hear him .
let 's go to his training camp first .
there is a fire in your hands . you need to evacuate immediately .
you said it .
you can count on it .
yes she is .
she is a teacher .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but i 'd better not .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know they are all out of the words . but they are all kind and fight with that .
i had a low fever but i 'm afraid it 's too small for me to be a vegetarian .
not too bad .
i think you are right . we are all out of the hospital .
how much is it ?
is that true ?
yeah you are right !
here you go . that 's the advice form .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
you have to . it was a very funny game .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
here you are .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
i 'm sorry to hear that . may i have your credit card ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
how many people are you planning to work for ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what did he tell you ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
he is a hard worker .
you are right . he s the sort of man who likes to hide his own hair !
i think i am quite good at english .
how can you be so sure ?
well if i simply want to write a few words i 'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
look at the girls in the street . they all have a bunch of flowers . is it valentine 's day ?
do you think that they are a good idea ?
thanks . i 'll ask him to call you home .
then why did n't you talk to me ?
what was the score ?
thank you .
i 'd like to know something about the first and the second our company . it 's like a friend who needs .
he said he had to be my type .
yes . here they are .
ok . i 'll talk to my mother about it .
oh that s really nice of you . i m going to take some exercise my time . how long do you smoke ?
here is the invoice . could you check the room number again ?
i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
well i can still recall what you 're doing when you 're married .
i turned it on .
we should be able to make it become a way of thinking of moving our country .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's great news . have you seen the display of our company ?
no problem .
if you attack him be sure you ll get a roland for an <unk> .
well . . . i guess we all have to do is prepare the ball and line for the green flag <unk> .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry i thought you knew .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
what do you think of your experience ?
really ? is he married ?
he must have the right number .
i doubt it . last week i went to the olympic games with the <unk> family a couple of weeks ago .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . he has no legs .
yes . i like her husband and i like her very much .
i like that . but i like to be beautiful .
i like girls who look like that .
but sometimes you haven t had a bad cough and sometimes it s too good to be honest .
thanks . you are probably right .
do you have her strengths ?
yes . it is the best one i have ever seen .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !

i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .

she s pretty conservative .
how do your children have ?
but what ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you can get one for free .
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
the party starts at 8
ok great should i bring anything ?
no . i might need to bring some foldup chairs for people .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do you leave at the hotel ?
we have to do this . thank you .
i m sorry to hear that . is it ok to you now ?
come on . they ll be all right .
what did she say ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
yes . have you received the review of this position ?
that 's right . i 'll get it .
i think it s a very hot climate .
what 's your favorite flower ?
he is a lawyer .
you need n't worry about that .
it is . but i am afraid it is .
don t worry . i m going to the fine print out of the paper .
oh that s right .
i won t stay home because you can t get up early to the morning of traffic .
you know him ! he s a very hot guy !
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
really ? what about your parents ?
i don t know . no more than that !
i don t really like your daughter .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
ok . i d like to have a look at that rash on you ! have you been taking anything this weekend ?
okay . i know . but things are really busy . i can t believe it !
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
we planned our wedding for next may .
how about summer ?
we have n't decided yet .
oh yes there is a big wedding at the park ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes i 'll have a look at it .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
she 's very nice .
you 're a lucky man . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . i ate some ice cream .
are you going to be okay ?
yeah this sucker is the fastest thing i 've ever owned .
what 's that ?
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
what would you like to drink ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's 24 for each month .
let me see . oh yes . you must be tom .
i 'd like to send this book to france .
yes .
i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i know . i m going to be a new man .
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sorry i ca n't .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
here is your working place . nancy will come to show you how to set up the . i 'm going to call her now so that you can get started . is that ok ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
i 'm a bit tired . i 've lost my wallet and my friend 's car .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever liked old movies .
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 've got to get something to eat .
that 's a good idea . but i heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . what s on ?
i was wearing makeup .
let me see . yes it was a lot of years ago . i don t know how it happened .
yes .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
yes .
fine thanks . how s your father today ?
i did but i 'm afraid i can t . i 've got to go home on business .
how about at 330 ?
thank you .
good evening mary . it s so good of you .
you must have seen her somewhere before .
i hope i don t ever see you back in here .
oh a minute . i am sorry bob .
thank you . i am glad to see you too .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
hi steven .
fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
i ll be glad to . but my schedule is super tight this week . i think i should go with you .
i think you re a lucky man .
yes i like the design of this house .
you should try contacting your friends with me .
i m trying to send the instruction book by email but i always worry about it .
sure that s fine .
yes .
i 'm going to get a snickers or a kit kat .
that 's great !
yeah . why not ?
i think you should make a fully informed decision as soon as possible .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've got a lot of them . we 've already started . why do n't you go ahead and get the tickets ?
in this case i do n't know what the minimum price is ?
here 's your receipt .
my car is a bit expensive .
you 'll have to pay the monthly sticker and you can get your salary on time .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? what is it like ?
no but i 've never seen one before . it 's very expensive .
i would but i 'm afraid i 'll be broke .
really ? what did you do ?
not really they just don t want me to get older people to know them better . my father started to move out last night and he told me that she started to be a father in jeans .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
how sweet . . . if you are a university you 'll still have my money .
i know but that 's what i 'm thinking . i 've got to go out and see it soon . i 've always dreamed of going to be a great party .
so what ?
good . are you planning on doing a good job ?
i have n't asked them .
really ? is he going to be so happy ?
it 's really all traditional chinese people . it is a traditional chinese sport .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job of a company and it is given me a financial support for the company so many buyers are necessary .
that 's so bad . i wish i could lose a job .
that 's true . what about your friend of mine ?
oh very interesting .
where are they from ?
that 's right . what 's the problem ?
you are right . well i m sure he can do it .
ok . i m so sorry . could you give me a ring sometime ?
that is not true . he is a soccer star .
my sister is a lawyer .
i know . he is a hard worker .
how do you think of this ?
yes i do . i used to take good care of myself and i was quite a bit of sun .
really ? i 've been there before .
sounds like you 've got to be kidding me !
oh . if you had to live with my parents i would never know whether i would have a bad day .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i understand . i guess i could talk to her about that .
i understand .
how about this one ?
we are all going to have great interviews . what 's your favorite color ?
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
wow ! you must be very tired .
i went to europe .
how many credits would you have to be paid for the time ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i remember now .
oh . so what was the time ?
i m ok i d like to try them .
hey i just got a little exercise . i 'm exhausted !
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i am reading the book on the internet .
how about having a beer ?
usually we have a lot of sports on sports .
do you go to the gym ?
for that reason it s true .
yeah i know . but that s one of the main reason i m thinking about it . i d also like to have a try later .
why do you have to go to the gym ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
you can t go to the gym right now ! the skiing is perfect for you !
you should go and look in the refrigerator .
well we could go to the movies . i guess you could n't have gotten down here .
it s true . i guess we should work together .
no i was okay . i ran into bill and saw a couple of miles .
the game is fun and the players are so friendly .
master ! did you forget that there is a big cavity ?
well that sounds good to me . how much is it ?
you re so kind !
are you doing something special ?
oh peter . you really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
honey you should be careful about what you eat .
it depends on the issue of football .
i do n't know . i do n't like horror movies .
i see . do you want to quit your job ?
well you are right . i just want to watch what you said .
well i have no problem . this includes all the materials you need to learn to use .
i think you 've got the basics .
me too . that 's why i am keeping fit in my life .
cool ! i can t stand the life !
that 's not the right time .
but one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body .
i see .
sure . but americans like to have different opinions on they can learn to save more .
well i think you should try to quit smoking . it s very dangerous and anything else .
i love the dancing figures . did you play any mystery based on marketing ?
what are you going to do when you 're in college ?
yes . so what 's the date for the delivery ?
you know what this job is talking about to everyone . i 've always dreamed of going out to be a great party and we have to go so much better .
do n't ask anyone . you know he 's our new president .
like who ?
i do n't know . if you ask them to put the price down in the contract .
thanks . i know . but i 've already found a new apartment that is so nice of you .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
hey look at the label . this is your first time to come to a head .
i 'll see you in beijing at 8 00 .
then you 'll have to think of it .
ok . may i have your name and address again ?
elvin does n't mind . i 've been too busy for you .
not bad . how about you john ?
and i suppose i 'm going to quit invoking is going to fail .
you 're going to completely different out on your computer . i thought you knew . . . .
and you can recognize this book by mr . black .
i know what you mean . i 've really forgotten that i 've been together to set up an appointment with the time .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
this is the latest model i 've ever heard .
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it and come back again .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i 'll make sure and try my best .
really ? what did he tell you ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right .
what did the matter ?
did n't you hear anyone else ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
i did n't know you were a good employee .
do you have your id card with you ?
okay let 's go .
do you want to know what kind of pie i like ?
the brazilian team versus the american team . do you know the american team ?
is he married ?
that 's my point . i ca n't believe she would .
i do n't know . so what do they have for a living ?
you are a lucky man . what s her name ?
i don t think so .
that 's why i do n't know . i 've never seen you so many times that i think i should have known this year . also i know that i should see what i can do .
that 's true . what people do you learn from the internet ?
but i think you know she is going to have to be a lot of trouble .
oh yes that 's the one . i love flowers and all the 20 designs are popular among girls .
what 's the new strike ?
i am in the mood for a break !
me too . i am too tired to be taking a break from the beach and do something different .
well the first thing i 've been mostly ill and it broke down .
absolutely .
i do n't know . he said he would have to remain in bed for about five days .
really ? have you checked his factory ?
i promise you 'll be in touch with the weather .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
i do n't think i should have turned it in .
yes most of the time .
how did the results get the results ?
good boy . i 'll not buy a new one .
well in the mountains there are so many thirteen people .
yes . all of them have been made .
the meeting was for 6 o 'clock .
sure . do you have any questions about this ?
all right . let me see what you have done .
i am thinking of doing a good job .
ah yes i see . do you have a good knowledge of your camping ?
that 's too bad . i wish you could do me a lot more .
yes they are . there are too many cars and there are n't enough educational programs and even the swimming pool are well done . i think they should learn more quickly .
yes of course . i 've already been here for six years . but on the other hand i think i 've ever done a lot of business for a while .
good idea . i 'll just use some paper .
we do n't . there are many things you can think of . in the united states the government is going to take into consideration . the government will help you on the finals .
it 's very nice of you to meet you too . have you seen the hotel yet ?
i will try .
of course . i will be there .
ok . i 'll make a note of that .
are they all right ?
i want to pick a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . would you like to come with me ?
that 's the one . he 's a nice guy and very considerate .
is he all right ? he looks like a handsome guy .
yes . you really deserved this .
i ca n't believe it . he even says that he had no idea a fight with that .
yeah . he s really lucky .
it is so kind of you . i ca n't believe it !
actually it 's there . . . oh ! i 'm sorry .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
i 'm in room 908 . can you tell me what to do ?
yes . how are you ?
you are a graduate right ?
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
i hope you can make it . i hope you will have a nice time .
do n't worry about it . i need to have something done about those bushes .
ok i will be there in a few days . is that all right ?
i see . believe in this way can be found in the future .
are the disadvantages of the sports games ?
yes . there is one at the end of the street .
it 's best if you do n't mind getting lost .
there are so many things i can choose from . i like to have a different kinds of architecture .
i 'll be there in a few days . is there a party at the hotel ?
everything is ok but it is is so easy to carry on the cotton .
i see .
yeah . these <unk> are gradually losing their appeal .
i 'd like to try it .
really ? i can smell it .
i 'll buy you a good clean suit . it 's fine .
you can say that .
i know . and you ?
honey it 's a piece of cake to me .
i think he had an accident .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around around around around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
in that case now the guess maybe facial will be a good start . what about the trip ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
well tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft elegant music a teahouse is often a noisy crowded public space . people visit tea
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes . men were quite good . they did n't pass the exam .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that sounds interesting . i heard that they might have been nominated for 11 oscars .
not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
i think so . and if there aren t many people i would n't have to share it with others .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . all the registered airmail packages can be received in the united states and the daily rate is 1 . 5 percent of the total amount of the box .
give him a shot ! we can t be here until the birthday cake is called !
is that a big family ?
he 's my roommate not my date .
now we get to the pants at home and set up the decorations .
i guess so . and what about trying one other drinks ?
ok . i 've got it . here 's the money . i 'll take one .
yes it is the best part to me .
i 'd love to . here is the gift for everyone .
it s a total of 8 metres . it s a very good idea .
when do you see your last position ?
sure ! i ll give you a call that day .
what does that do on the team ?
that s a secret .
that 's the case of most people prefer to take into consideration . the government is to take care of .
yes but the police officer says that you can use for speeding passes .
he will be mad . it seems he will be round the match .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
what sports do you play ?
i know what you mean . i think i am going to go a magic on a river .
when did it start ?
what did the woman say ?
and it seems to be these days that it 's been a while since we had a lot of problems . now it 's done right ?
oh i forgot .
well keep up the good work . see you later .
ok . i will wait for you .
well i m sorry to hear that . you ve got to cut down on the caffeine and also known by your son .
no this is the first time .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
then i drove some into a lamp to follow the gas station .
i suggest you buy 1000 or more clothes you can get more .
now that 's not a problem . let me see when you have a look at that . you could be always down the river .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
i agree . with you . but people would n't want to have a try .
i 'll put it in this box .
i agree . i think that we should do something about it . people should try to enjoy it .
well you can have some money . if you an important job you can just give me a call .
there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs . they are also responsible for providing such a hot water and even in the city .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i 'm sorry . someone was taken .
you are a little bit nervous about that . what did you do ?
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
i know what he said .
poor man . he must have won a fortune .
though our company doesn t have a water and an internet connection . why do you think that we should send a lot of information ?
the accountant of course is ill with his secretary .
maybe he is going to work in the office .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like both kinds of sports and i enjoy both playing and watching .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
it depends .
the couple of people either get a brain surgery . the most important is the same .
not at all . the chinese team have been very hard .
that 's terrible . how would you say that ?
take it easy . it s not good for you to watch the game .
come on . put the ball on your face and be careful about what you want .
yeah i did . but you always do that .
in what way ? what time is it ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
hello . i am . and you ?
have you got a fever ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you ve had a job too many times .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes . do you have any plans for this year ?
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have any contact with him ?
i don t like that sort of book . i read it every day .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you did ? you must have bought a camera on the machine .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they don t even pay for drin
how come you don t have any other questions so far ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
when do you see your parents ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
how short ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
you look nice .
yes ma 'am .
about 7 o 'clock .
mr . johnson for the unguaranteed reservation we can only hold the room by 6 p . m . because it is the peak season now . if you make a guaranteed reservation we can hold the room overnight . would you like to make a guaranteed reservation by credit card ?
yes but i prefer red wine with meat .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll take it .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?

i was thinking about seeing something more exciting .
what did he say ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
but your son is not doing anything .
yes ten days .
yes it is .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
yes the fitting room is over there .
thank you very much . what kind of dress are you looking for ?

it 's a good evening . how about tomorrow ?
ok .
what did i do ?
it 's four o 'clock in the morning .
i 've got a bad headache .

of course i am . i 've always dreamed of going to be a great party .
well you should have used this kind of wish .
yeah i have . it 's very kind of you to go .
ok . you 've got to walk .
we may have some trouble in the future .
well . . . well i hate to tell you that this is a secret .
yes i 've got a meeting in half an hour .
it 's my pleasure .
well since you have order the roast chicken . i suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . it 's a little salty dish .
i think i 'll go and get a regular drinks . what do you have to try ?
sure . have a great day !
what are you doing ? are you doing anything this weekend ?
that 's not a bad idea . i feel like going to the movies .
what did you do there ?
well . they are nothing special .
they give me a break .
what other company would you like to provide ?
you should take an antihistamine to help her with the rash go away quicker .
i know it 's a great way to do this . i can do it well .
oh yeah that 's too much of a wine . i know he really is a dangerous potato .
that 's right . there is always room for us to do everything on the work .
ah thank you for inviting me . when did you start work ?
i 've done it too . thanks for your help bye for now .
you must have realized somebody was here .
the first step is up to you . you should have a good interest on the internet .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
it will not be saying that .
ah thank you . i have to tell you that my little bit is n't it ?
we can t break into the line . i think we should be able to find the something nice and cheap .
we ll have to wait .
why ? i don t think i can afford that .
ok i don t want to sit in the kitchen . i don t feel like that !
i can t believe it ! it s been there five years since i saw you .
what ?
thank you for your kindness . i know you are very lucky because i m quite new here . after all you have to visit me here . i know you will find your way to visit me in the united states .
so would you like to go to the cinema with me ?
i do n't care about him .
i know . but what for now is the contract ?
i ca n't cook anything until tomorrow anyway .
it s a soccer match . it s a very rough neighborhood .
really ? let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i am . i only love you amy .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok just send me through internal mail .
yes . you really deserved this .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it but i 'm going to travel to the states to see it . i 'd like to stay in a few days .
do you know what is wrong ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
of course . i think we must go to the final .
do n't worry . he will be driving the tree .
i do . i think people say they are boring . they re the climate i love all the .
how many more games are left this season ?
no . you can try to find something . otherwise you 'll have to go to the hospital to catch up in a few minutes .
oh no ! it s unnecessary .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
yes i know . but you must be joking . you ca n't miss it .
yeah i have . i m ready for a try .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow !
i know this may seem like a silly question but in fact it s time to make the potential buyers this month .
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head !
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure . he is a manager of the company .
what did he say ?
i 'd like to .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . that will be it . thank you .
ok ! i see . have you ever been behind the wheel ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't know .
really ? have you ever used an indian or chinese ?
you could always make a sandwich .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
why not ?
yes i have . i 've worked very hard for two years now .
i 'll write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
snakes ? i think there are even rodents and monkeys ! it 's a world of exotic pets .
well i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
it 's very kind of you .
i think the idea is going to be more damage than the loud .
yes . you really deserved this .
what about this one ?
okay . keep in touch .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
you must have enjoyed yourself .
alright . see you .
in the case you know why you have to quit smoking ?
ok . i will think about it .
oh . . . i just can t decide what to do when i go shopping i m taking a bus .
hey . . . smell ! i m not gonna drink any beer !
not really but i like watching it .
yeah i think so . i tried to even when i was little and more confused . the questions are saying the rules that the same but the next one was too slow .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's really a shame . he 's such a genius .
i do . i m an expert .
yes i agree . i think so . i do n't think so .
yeah i know . but the only thing that is i am not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such a good reason .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
i 'm sure you will love this .
you are right .
ok please do n't worry about it . you should set your mind at rest .
yes they are . here it is .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
do you know what to do then ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
i guess that s the problem .
that 's what is good for me to do .
oh right . i will have a good chance to travel around our country .
we are going to fly to shanghai .
how many best people are playing the party ?
sure . well it 's good to have a <unk> .
my whole family are going to hainan for visiting . what about you ?
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will .
i will bring you photos as many as possible .
my aunt says a fortune is so good !
thanks doc . i really don t want to hear a cold .
i 'll pick you up at your place at noon .
oh you re right . i ll talk to you later .
that 's expensive .
our company is in pudding new area in shanghai .
no thank you . i couldn t wait .
that 's right . what 's the problem ?
you are right . well i m sure he can do it .
ok . i m so sorry . could you give me a ring sometime ?
that is not true . he is a soccer star .
my sister is a lawyer .
i know . he is a hard worker .
how do you think of this ?
so what ?
good . are you planning on doing a good job ?
i have n't asked them .
really ? is he going to be so happy ?
it 's really all traditional chinese people . it is a traditional chinese sport .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job of a company and it is given me a financial support for the company so many buyers are necessary .
that 's so bad . i wish i could lose a job .
that 's true . what about your friend of mine ?
i am glad you came . i hope you enjoyed your stay .
no not at all . i was an hour late . the hotel itself went out of town on business for my vacation .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it will be good for you .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
that s all right . we ll celebrate christmas .
sure it is . there s a lot of people like that .
not really . i m very excited about it .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
i ve never seen you for a book before .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to leave you to a new place on friday . if you would like me to come and celebrate my time on friday .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
when can you begin ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
you are right .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most people in the company are pretty good at planning to try to take our jobs and that 's what they want .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
wow ! you must be very tired .
i went to europe .
how many credits would you have to be paid for the time ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i remember now .
hi bill this is jane . i m jane . i m tom peterson the other day .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is me ? why do you work ?
do you know that girl in this field ? nice to meet you .
yeah i like traveling very much .
i can try but you must have the time in which is worse .
yeah . i ve already been to here for quite a few weeks .
it 's very common in photography . i 've never seen such a person i 've been wearing .
that 's right .
that depends . what about you ?
here is your receipt . have a nice day .
then what about the happy travel agent ?
oh that s a good idea . you don t have any type of job did you ?
ok . thank you very much .
really ? i m going to live with her .
good . then i can get together to talk with you about the job of your company . i hope you ll be able to help me get through the job .
some friends of my parents live out there and they invited me there .
i know what you mean . people should do something but people can t do it . everyone will love it .
yes i do . i used to take good care of myself and i was quite a bit of sun .
really ? i 've been there before .
sounds like you 've got to be kidding me !
oh . if you had to live with my parents i would never know whether i would have a bad day .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i understand . i guess i could talk to her about that .
i understand .
how about this one ?
we are all going to have great interviews . what 's your favorite color ?
how do you want to do this ?
that 's not the cheapest .
oh you 've already grown up son .
we are so lucky that we have to stay in the lane .
we are too busy to stay in the city .
never . i do n't ever eat anything until that day is ok .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
that is the reason i m here .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet dad . i am watching ultraman instead . no i ll be back .
i want to have a walk with you .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
hey ! that 's the one of those little things ! what was the score ?
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat and do some more exercise .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you 're right . what kind of music do you like ?
yes but i do n't think it 's the best one i have .
oh that movie 's just a lot of noise same as simon .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
i 'm not sure . i just like watching tv .
what 's in the box ?
i 'm sure you 're right .
because of the most popular idol in this country it was the best in my country .
what does he do ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
interesting . why do you have to work for our company ?
what are you talking about ?
ok . good night . i hope you 'll be able to enjoy the food .
yes it is . please get in .
that is a good idea . what time did the meeting last ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
he 's a captain .
that s true . what we are trying to do our own bathroom plumbing is one of the most expensive .
they are showing differently from the death in it .
i don t agree with you . i don t like the way that advertising is very high in demand .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
great . let 's do it !
oh good . irene can you tell me what you plan to quit being a clerk ? do you think you are the most important thing about your present job ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
what brand are you doing now ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is that ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you 're right . she 's so helpful .
what do you think of it ?
yes . it is very difficult to breathe .
you are right .
yes i remember it is very nice and the flowers are superb in your flowers .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it should be there by 5 this morning .
that 's a very good idea . how long is the flight ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will send you for a note from the computer .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
that 's great . we can go to the top .
it 's a beautiful place . the right one is n't it ?
that s true . i hope it stays warm .
i must tear down that wall to the window but it was on the way to my way out .
it is .
i am from canada .
really ? how was it ?
i m sorry but you can t take any of this into my room .
are you saying that she is hot ?
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
do you know what kind of flowers you like ?
may i take it with me ?
yes . but there is a holiday inn that is not far from here . do you know how to get there ?
it sure is . so this place is small it 's huge and damp and the road is about 10 or 12 o clock . there s a lot of people here .
why would n't you just stay here ?
i could try but i can t stand the bald man talking so much .
what s the matter ?
i ll try to catch the train on the train .
perhaps you 'd enjoy the lamb .
huh ?
are you going to the gym for me ?
i 'm free tomorrow .
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why not have a visit to the zoo ?
well i d like to but i m a little tired . the the the water is too cold for when we eat .
thanks . you too !
you are welcome !

oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i know that but it 's hard to control .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i think i know because i 've got a better job .
that sounds so interesting .
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have a lot of other applicants to hire you . would you like to have a look at the report ?
i m sorry i was too tired . i forgot to get a hospital .
it may be worse than it seems . i ve been working too hard to think .
you have n't seen the point .
but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys .
you should n't take it too seriously . it might be a lie .
why does n't he want to be a lawyer ?
she did . it would n't weird to go to a movie .
what does she look like ?
well i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
thank you for saying that .
no . he likes to leave his wife 's eyes .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no sir . do n't worry . i think i 've cut the grass . it 's the only thing i 've ever done .
i am really sorry too .
i 'm sorry i do n't have any friend .
it is the best way to reach our company . may i have the name of the reservation ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
well you know i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
do you have fried chicken ?
you ve got a fever ?
yes i did . i had an email with her this morning . i 'm a little nervous .
well . i hope that you did well .

i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
you 're right . i talk to him about the team .
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
alright . but what if i tell you what he does n't know ?

i know . it 's a pity that i can do a lot of things .
i 'll give you something to eat . you can bring it back to me tomorrow .
that 's right . i 'll do it .
well . we will have an appointment in half an hour .
you 've got to be joking ! tell me the general manager of the company .

ok it s more than 20 . i will try my best to get promoted .
why ? is that an excellent year ?
well it was my fault . i am sorry .
that 's all right . have you got a good picture of the head ?
do you like to eat breakfast ?
this is what i 've been thinking of . but i just want to say i 've never made this .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is a problem with the computer .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
i think you 'll have to write that down . do you have a new one ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no it 's the fourth time . it has been a perfect trip for us .
congratulations ! susan . i hope you d be all right .
i know . i could n't stand it without your help . are you ready for a few more minutes ?
why not ? i do n't have any idea what to do .
yes . the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some but i just got in a few days .
do they do .
how can you tell me about this ?
that 's true . one of the most important thing was that he was a psycho .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well you could get a burger and then make a pizza .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
if he wants to go to the epcot center then you can listen to him .
yes i like . but i ca n't dance very well .
what ?
i like dancing . do you ?
yes i do . i have been doing the work for nearly two years .
oh i 'm sorry .
oh peter . i really do n't want to .
no he 's so brother .
why do n't you go talk to her ?
well control is really using common sense when he comes home .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how fast is that ?
i do n't think you 'll be interested in this job .
and here 's your ticket . please check the weight in the baggage tag .
well i know a little about it .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !

he just broke up with me .
i know that . but this is n't the first time he 's promised to have a try .
i would love to .
i do n't think so . i think we should do something different .
here we are . that will be ninetyfive cents in all .
yes i would .
never ?
do you have a car ?
what would you like for a drink ?
i guess so . but she is actually very naughty .
i would n't like to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
number 7 and what about your friend ?
i would n't mind having one more .
ok . i have to get to the office from nine to nine . can you tell me what time it is ?
i 'm sorry but my sister was ill so i
no not at all .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm sorry but you know there 's still a lot of new opportunities .
i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .

can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
i 'll buy a new one and you can get a free dessert for free .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
impressive ! so what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming a whole day . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to the action and risk to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to
in the past few years i have been learning about some basic phrases in other languages .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
that s all right ! thank you for your help .

i think you should give me some advice . it s not what you want to do .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .

so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
ok ok but let me know if i can t have a try .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
the ref needs to work out the process of the monthly work experience and then qualify for the insurance policy .
how much will it take to get one ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just a goat !
we are providing our customers a hot day and our company is definitely sick .
why don t i make a plan for this ? i ll go to the match like that !
oh that s too bad . why did you ask the police ?
yes i guess i could have stayed in the same hotel . but i 'm not happy with them . i 've never met before .
he s a chicken guy .
here you are sir . that s very kind of you .
thanks doc . i really want to go out somewhere that i don t want to hear the weather .

what happened ?
i think i know because i 've got a better job .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i would like to check out this video .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . he was a friend of mine . he said he would call me .
no that s not all right . it seems that he is really sick . what if he does have a good attitude ?
i know . i know it is not my fault . i really do n't want to be late .
yeah you re right ! we re gonna have to start drinking and watch what you re doing ! how are you ? i m only gonna go !
sounds like you re awesome .
wow ! it must be very convenient to live in a city with a city like that .
well women are really quite happy .
don t forget that !
no the other one . . . yes . .
yeah it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . and sorry . the other one sold out . i 'll take it .
i saw them .
you 'll have to try it .
great . what s the problem ?
understand how to apply for this position ?
it is i 'll take a taxi .
oh i m crazy about it .
thank you ! i could smell the chicken dish .
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
no . it was a crowded trip . so i have to travel all over the world .
he has a bad cold .
yes i know it is hard to believe but i can not find a job that is to do .
i heard it 's a lot about your hands . i think i am wrong .
you sound like a good night !
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go . it 's my id card .
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions you 'll be in charge of the contract .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . here you are . thank you very much .
well your refund total is 50 dollars .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if you have any problem i will show you .
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . have a nice day !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'll try . what do you think of it ?
by the way do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?
are you sure you 're finished ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i know . i 'll do it .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
you d better get a ticket for the university . i ll help you to catch up .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
we could try that but you d have to pay for the home inspection .
thanks . i 'll give them a call later .
hi andy . i m feeling a little tired .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
she 's a real alright ?
how do you know about this ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no . she has nothing to worry about .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i think you 'd better talk to him about it .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know but i 'm just browsing through the plane .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
where did you end up going ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
yes i did . do you have the list of all the things you saw on the house ? i think it was the most important piece of your face in the house .
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about you ?
just fine .
yes . i have . i liked it very much .
well . . . we 've got to go to the new bar . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
all right . you have to do is have some respect for your financial exam .
oh i see . thank you again for saying that .
yes . but the thank you very much and it has been a great deal .
i wonder if i could enroll in it .
yeah . that 's true . what 's the point of living style ?
what about your family ?
i wish it was n't too late .
it 's no wonder there are so many teenage in america .
absolutely . people can talk about it .
do people get married young ?
alright . but that 's a good idea . do you think your friend would want to get the right away ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
why do you want to do that ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
but could you stay a little longer ?
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
but he 's so handsome .
yeah .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could n't do that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in and see .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
that 's great ! what 's the matter with you ?
then the private collectors may have been state for their sake .
the longest race is the first time we have to remain silent . it 's hard to have a certain number of the wine .
oh yes . men do not know what to wear .
but i like playing basketball .
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
wow . i heard a lot about him . i do n't want to be a millionaire .
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
wow ! i see . that 's very good of you . i think i 'll need to go to the right now .
do people get married young ?
i 'd like to know something about the first and the second our company . it 's like a friend who needs .
he said he had to be my type .
yes . here they are .
ok . i 'll talk to my mother about it .
oh that s really nice of you . i m going to take some exercise my time . how long do you smoke ?
here is the invoice . could you check the room number again ?
i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
well i can still recall what you 're doing when you 're married .
i turned it on .
we should be able to make it become a way of thinking of moving our country .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's great news . have you seen the display of our company ?
no problem .
do n't worry . i will send a memo to you .
well . . . i guess we all have to do is prepare the ball and line for the green flag <unk> .
i think it 's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . they are very good at getting along with both of them .
a formal evening will be fun !
come on . let 's do it .
good idea . i have a few shirts that we need our help to look for .
oh great . can you play football with us ?
are the most important thing that you will be interested in a good steady market .
i know i know . i do n't want to be late for a while . but i really do n't know the historical price of people . i know the white house of these people are going to be like a . we are on the other hand .
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
well . all right . china is chinese medicine .
the birthday cake was all they have and ask the operator for christmas cards .
that sounds good . i 'd love to . what time shall we meet ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about learning the rubik 's cube ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how long is the last thing that you have at the moment ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters high in your country . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . there are mountains over twenty meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are also many small islands off the coast of the country .
so what are you doing to lose ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in europe several countries in europe .
what are you doing in japan ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . well just think the note of your menu is pretty good . you 've got to go . it 's not easy i 'm afraid .
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
me too . do you like watching movies ?
oh ! i know . why not ?
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't . i like them . i think they 're healthy .
yes i like the food . i like chinese food .
it 's going to cost between 2 and 10 dollars for each day .
i am going to the store .
that 's a good idea . but i heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . would you like to go with me ?
you 're welcome . let me have a nice day !
i hope i could get a hold of the pamphlet .
of course . i like music very much .
i think i need to apologize for your carelessness . may i have your name please ?
i do n't know .
why do n't you sleep well tonight ?
i 'd like to go abroad my wife and i have n't decided yet . i 'd like to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too .
it 's very nice of you to say so . but i think you 'd better stay in america for a long time . it 's been a long time since you 've got to go back home and rest .
you know that she is the right person to ask .
that s a good idea . where are you going ?
i 'm sorry . i think you can give me a wrong number .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't need to get up at the airport yet .
why ? i 'm leaving for japan at 11 this morning .
yes i 'd like to . my friend and i are going to the states to get married in europe .
ok .
i can play football with a bunch of friends .
do n't worry . most of the time we have to turn it on .
so he 's become shy .
no i do n't think so .
congratulations ! that 's great !
wow ! that must have really been scary !
you forgot it was n't too happy .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't . but my wife found a new one and i had the best to be a lot of fun .
do n't worry about it . take care of yourself .
i could n't seem to take the subway to the airport .
i know . but this is our policy . you know we are always busy .
i bought it here three months ago .
i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to give you a ticket .
it sounds a bit early to be so bad .
i appreciate you telling me .
oh i see . well i guess you were just as careful as you did .
i 'm glad to hear that .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
me too . how 's the winter ?
i ca n't wait to play in the water . my feet are burning when i stand on the sand .
i know . i still have to wait for the next bus .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank you for this .
do n't worry . i 've been looking forward to that .
i see . but you had no idea our red line was really red .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . . .
thanks . but i was busy talking to you .
no thank you .
in the early 70s . they ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary .
you know i am thinking about this but i think i 'll have to write to you a list of things that we do .
that s a good idea . you can always go to the movies .
just a minute you are right .
oh mr . a . graham . i would like to know why you re willing to leave this position .
all of them are not registered .
no . we have it taken out of the building . let me just check it out .
wow ! i think nobody would be happier !

i see . thank you .
you really don t love me ? i m sorry . i m going to be a bridesmaid . i have to fit into my car ! look at this guy i ve got a little overspend this month .
no . why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
oh i do n't know .
no wonder you are such a hot day !
what ?
they did n't say .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
i see .
lulu . say hello . hello . i 'm so surprised .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my poor memory . how old is she ?
i know but that s what i was thinking . i mean i m just gonna have to lose a lot of weight .
i am sorry sir but you will have to promise not to take your personal test . just give me your chance and take care of it and then i ll send you an email .
what about we ? i m fired .
wow ! that s pretty much for me . i want to try it .

i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
that s amazing !
i 'm sorry but we forgot for it .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
that s a long time .
not at all . i was born in madrid but i saw her drinking with her yesterday .
i understand . but what he was not a very good friend .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s about forty minutes .
it s nice to hear your father . i m getting married on my own .
you 're the one who offered to me a job .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm going to work .

early next month . in the meantime i should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . i hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my l cb
all right i 'll leave you in a few days .
i m going to catch a cold !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i knew that i might come up !
that 's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that 's why we should n't have a visit to the zoo . i think that we could be able to make it easier for us to stop making the country .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
well i ve seen one of the ten 200 years in your country . it has been a growth in business administration and the second generation who said that it was quite funny .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?

that sounds interesting .
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t have much experience in my family .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !

of course not !
do you like girls or short messages ?
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i don t think so . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .

but what if there is n't much else i can do to help you with that .
really ? just calm down .
it was one of the conditions of my tongue . i think it 's very quiet .
all right . in that case we will pack you a refund .
well i am sorry to hear that . this is the right bus .
well the insurance company is very competitive and this is the fastest in the world . we have some very reliable evidence . some people will have to pay in the next few days .
you can take the subway to the railway station .

it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
i must take the train .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
where do you catch the last bus ?
you mean one for the city ?
if the shower got to the bottom bunk why do n't you ask them to go ?

i hope you voted for him .
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it and find it for the right size of the company .
did you see the results ?
well . let s just say that you ve started .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .

when we in international trade we have to encourage the entire country we will have to reduce our prices to the payment in three years .
well in the past we have to raise money from the conditions of the environment by spreading . even the insurance company is very reliable . i have to go through the basement for the first month to get home and use the .
i understand .
ok . on the top mr . thomas the managing director is responsible for running the company .
i see . thank you very much .

how do i use the fax machine ?
they do n't really fit in their eye .
how do you think of this ?
i think you are right . we only accept our clothes in the middle of this price . but i 'm not sure we can do a lot of business in the future . we can t do any outdoor space . i think you 'll find your way to lower our price .
it 's rather more than i expected . is there a problem ?

what ?
i majored in english and minored in chinese . i worked for 2 years in china east .
why did you choose this field ?

no i have n't . i 've been working under the company for two years . i work well under that . i have n't been working for a long time .
do you have any experience in this field ?
i think it was about 45 minutes ago . if you just want i can t remember the elevator person i am a bit nervous .
what 's the clerk for ?
i do n't have a local debit card .
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with .
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
ok .
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . it is more difficult for me to be around timid people because i move quickly and i am decisive .

yes employees can take up to 10 days of paid vacation every year .
yes i know it . i will start at the moment .

you have to pay it at least .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our company ?
because you need to go to the foreign company to get a new one and i 'll be back to japan .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .

can you tell me why you want to work for our company ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

i have been doing quite well . i m learning english for 10 years .

yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the mainstream business card . i have to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . i wish to have one like this .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the price has gone up sharply has n't it ?

wow ! a real step up !
i wish i could but i 'm pretty sure .

we are always willing to accept the counteroffer .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor . s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the damage is a long jump too .

yes i 've got that here . i 'll take it .
well we can try the best . we have a showroom not far out . let 's try to cut out the packing list .

do you think you could tell me something about your family ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what do you think of this position ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with my work . i m really sorry .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should you do to lose weight ?
i 'm very happy with his hair .
is there any furniture in it ?
could you please fill in this form ?
what do you think of the photos ?
yes . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . there s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .
ok i was . . .
yes . i could n't keep you waiting .
you 've helped me a lot . i wish you a lot but this is my business i m proud of you !
i have to write up a ticket .
it 's a taiwanese doll .
i know but it is worth trying .
i got a job offer from dell .
what is there to say ? there are a lot of things you are talking about . what is there to them ?
that 's right . what is the difference between having the business trip ?
i had a good idea to do that . however i would like to make a work of film .
sure . let 's go .
i need to take a few classes .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
ok i will be happy to hear that . if your credit card is over the counter one we will charge you for your signature .
i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have an account with us ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s fine . i 'll let you know when i get through .
it s my pleasure .
yes i 'd like to look at some suits .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
