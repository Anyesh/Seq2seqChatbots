i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
that 's fantastic !
i only have a couple of beer .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i am looking for a sweater .

you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
thank you . which bus is the fare ?
and the tv station is over crowded too .
i 'm not the same with you . when you go down my street you 'll see it 's not as much fun as in my heart . i always just have to watch the ball .

it 's 120 dollars .
that s right . no one else has to be done !
of course not . your total is 5 . 48 .
i was thinking of 30 off .
it 's rather more than i was thinking of paying .
i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .

it 's not expensive . ok .
thank you .
sure . . .
oh i remember now . when did i start ?
sure but let me check .
to be honest i think it is very difficult to stop caught in the future .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it was a pleasure .
that would be great . what can i do ?
ok . i 'll wait a minute .
hi .
where did you get it ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
ok . i 'll be sure to take a look .
you ll get a lot of money in the good news . i ll tell you where the copy is .
i will .
i 'm sorry . it 's not allowed .
would you please fill out this form ?
yes we do . may i have your laundry ticket ?
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks .
an appetizer and a half for lunch !
how many nights a week is it ?
let me see . . . it 's 50 .
can i pay by card ?
i think there 's no problem . it 's a however charge for that .
it was a pleasure .
that would be great . what can i do ?
well what 's the problem ?
ok let 's go .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
no problem . here you are .
can you make my hair short ?
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
it 's much better than mine .

i think you 've got a lot of work .
i appreciate your understanding .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that s the second time i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
i 'd rather have it if you do n't mind .
what 's your plan ?
yes . go to the rear corner and turn left .
i hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
no i 'll do it in a minute .
how many miles to go ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
that 's great . i like it .
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on the third floor .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yes it is . there are many rooms available in the hotel .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that 's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada for 110 of the price of the real thing .
how about this one ?
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than 100 you get a 50 voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes you have the fitting room in the corner .
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
this is kevin .
no i 'm not . i 'm really full .
well do n't be too humble . we could not have some similar products for our products .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
in the middle of the world there is a part of the world .
i know . maybe i 'll get her some scarf too .
well it 's a cheap thing for a fancy camera .
i do n't like this kind of style .
yes .
well i d say you re not interested in your cooking but the best way to do your health .
ok . let 's go and have a look .
i am not good at it by me .
ok . let s go .

thank you .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
let 's see what the damage is .
ok i 'll have a try . what do you have to eat ?
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
i 'll take a cheesecake .
maybe they have a taste for me .
are you kidding me ?
they 're very delicious . they taste so delicious .
i think i would like to have the coffee rum pies .
you 'll be fined .
it 's a place to sit next to the inside .
i 'd like the lasagna please .
hmm . i think they will be ok .
no thanks . i 'll have the kung fu jing .
blah . . . what 's that ?
ok . i m going in a minute .
what ?
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
what do you like best ?
how long does it take you to cook the meal ?
yes i have . i have never had a home inspection before .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i m going to the store to buy some . i think i ll have to see it .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
what flavor do you like to check ?
hello sir may i help you ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry . but i think you two should have told her .
is she helping her doctor ?
what symptoms does she have ?
do n't worry about it . your english education is good enough .
thank you .
can you spell that please ?
thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with white sauce ? i 'm rather round of it .
what 's the problem ?
are you scared of anything ?
please wait a moment .
what 's wrong julia ?
do you have any identification ?
so you have your own car ?
is there anything else you would like to get ?
what 's the problem ?
oh right . we can not beat a woman like that .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
so that i do n't have to work to do all day .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
by all means . i was just going to stay at home .
that 's fine . i 'll make a reservations for the whole set .
i 'm not sure if we 're going to get stuck in traffic jam .
that 's right .
besides you should also call the interviewers if you are interested in other things .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
i see .
no . that 's all .
that s good . do you think you can tell her ?
ok i will just sit right back and let me check that for you .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's the problem ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it s about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . you can do better tomorrow .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . please have a seat .
is it cold on the floor ? i hate you to see the air .
i wrote the check out for way too much .
yes it is really a lot of fun . thank you for saying so .
yes it seems that it 's like a traffic jam .
sure . how much are you selling it for ?
i see . that s fine . i want to order breakfast now .
you need to do an investigation .
mmmm . . . i ve just bought a bag of silk and some silk blouse . you can see that the sale is very good .
i 'll give you mine too .

just a moment please .
i 'm glad you like it .
how about your mother ?
how long will it take to get to the books ?
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at s department store .
what are you doing to improve your work ?
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . what if i bought it for ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper .
how can you do that ?
because i would n't know the price of the fine notes .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
i 'm afraid not . the price is reasonable because the checkout is only reasonable .
no it 's not . it 's a really big problem . everyone has to carry it all over .
do you accept checks ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?

we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?

those people are quarrelling .

yeah it was a very expensive hobby .
exactly .
why are you going for such a hurry ?
what did you say ?
ok . that 's great to hear . have you found an apartment with us ?
i m a very cool guy .
so would i . that s a good idea to get a checkup or a bedroom .
which building ?
why did you decide to leave it ?
also you should make your decision .
i might be dead disappointed .
yes . but the view is much more expensive than the bedroom .
yes sir . where to ?
wangfujing please !
it 's a square kilometers .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .
that 's good . i 'll be free around 6 pm . can you make it any other time for me ?

i 'll do that .
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my daughter 's home .
three thousand yuan please .
do i have to pay to use the plane ?
thank you .
yes here you are .
yes sir . where to ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
we have a lot of experience . here is your ticket .
i 'm giving you a little bit of a ring next week .
how long will you stay with us for the registration ?
here is 30 dollars .
it s under the couch .
you should n't have gotten a ticket for you ?
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
in that case you have to go to the office to get my jewelry box .
thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
by all means .
thank you . we 'll bring the receipt up to your room when we get it .
i 'm sorry i 'm going to the gym but i 'm not sure . i 'm going to the gym right now .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's right . shall we have a drink together ?
ok see you .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
sounds good . do you have any questions about our company ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . i 'll go .
yes i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 . 00 dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is convenient . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 a day .
it is a little bit expensive but it 's worth it .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i am not the one who needs to pay it to be the best .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello alice .
wow ! what a beautiful day !
i am terribly sorry . i did n't know that .
very well thank you .
not a lot actually . i 've been watching a lot of books out of the house and do n't have much time to worry .
i 'm glad you 've done a lot for me .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you are welcome . please remember to be your best friend .
see you .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been under stress for the past few days .
i see . thank you .
he 's a bit handsome .
if she was a famous singer in means a person what would she do ?
no it 's not your fault .
hmm . . . that 's easy . one day the ball is coming .
but it 's about time !
i 'm sorry sir but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
i am afraid i have n't got one . can i send it by email ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
that 's exactly what i want to do .
yes it is !
you mean i can t do anything out ?
all you ever do is have a water cooler . i think we should get a lot of things .
do you use the electric map ?
can you play other game for me ? i m sure you ll have to get a lot of practice .
well maybe we can just trade them . i guess they are n't so serious .
what ?
yes . i think it s better than the police . now that i can t find a job .
i m looking for a sweater .
are you a sure you can buy one here ?
hmm . . . i can handle them . what are you looking for ?
are you sure you lost your wallet ?
how about the top ?
with pleasure .
listen it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles .
how much does that cost ?
okay then let 's meet this afternoon .
i see . how about that ?
. . . yes !
i see . what a cool blue shirt !
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is it pam and you 're travelling to london for me .
yes i think the one is your size . how about this one ?
there s nothing particular with it .
that s right . everything is so fine . let s take a look .
i might make a difference to you .
no problem .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! how long are you gonna stay there ?
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh ok .
no . that s all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .
i see . do you want me to show you some ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i see . what is the special effects ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
what is your aim in watching ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how long have you been playing the game for ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well . if you want to come to the room can i have a look ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i 'm here to get my salary .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
what else do i have to do ?
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
i was told to put a sales manager in a different company .
we are terribly sorry to hear that .
why don t you try to quit your present job ?
it looks like you 're going to have to put your own stuff in the tree .
can you do me a favor ?
it is the most expensive . you can have a little carpet in the mirror .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
i am sorry . there is no doubt in that size .
how can you be sure of your fashion ?
there . it looks great don t you think ?
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it is . but there is some gas and water in the living room .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
you know that it looks nice .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
i have n't thought of that .
how much are you looking for ?
it s nice to meet you too .
the rent is 400 yuan a week .
that s way too much .
what is your hobby ?
i m glad to hear that .
only ten percent of the amount you please .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
would you mind telling me the reason that i won t be able to travel any cash ?
in my opinion could you please come to the station with me and teach me how to play the piano ?
i am afraid not . the trip is too noisy that i could n't afford to .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was 12 years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah the supermarket is very delicious . but there is too much etiquette to follow . i will take them .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
would you like me to have it done before you come ?
an ordinary one .
an ordinary one will be fine . i also need your help with the color . i also need a few cartridges . the design will be very good .
you can get the high price if it is high ?
i m sorry to hear that .
what would you consider your strengths ?
sure . i like wearing shorts in the summer . my legs would freeze !
that 's fine . i 'd like to have that color washed .
how about all your sideburns ?
it 's a good idea . what about the quality ?
i m going to give you a larger dress . there is one hundred dollars a month for our daughter .
the dress is slim in cut .
this is the right place . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think that it would be a great idea . and also i can see a nice view of the exotic pets .
i 'm happy to hear that . i 'll be right back to the apartment soon .
good . i ll see you then .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
no i think i know what to get .
you 're welcome . good luck .
thank you .
no . that 's all . you have to bring another copy with us .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
if you 're staying in an apartment today you 'll have to go to the states . it 's not the size of the flat .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i 'm going to have to buy a new house .
great . i can t wait to move my car until the end of the week .
i think you ll find a sweater for you . i can call the it department .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
i think that 's a little <unk> .
they said that it s quite a few dollars for the kitchen .
well the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i see .
right now there are three bedrooms two barrooms a sitting room a sitting room a dining room and a living room . we 're hoping to add on a green room . in fact when the guest bedroom is ready you should come and a weekend .
perfect ! you can pick up your new house in a few days with your friends .
ok let s sit in the back and enjoy the sun in the second .
oh here s my card just give me a call if you re interested .
i know . i should take a look at the sometime game then .
my god ! it 's a big outdoor place .
i like the balcony and we can walk there .
the master suite is the best . let 's go look at that next .
ok but i am going to have to give you a call next week .
the aroma of coffee beans .
i am the manager . how can i help you ?
hello may i help you ?
you can t be serious .
i would love to move in with you too .
yeah i will .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
good luck !
i 'll see you then .
do you have any experience in this field ?
thank you .
no . that s all . just make sure you check your spark plugs fuel and other channels later .
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about it on right now . i should tell you about it as it as it only goes until next tuesday . if
ok . what if you want to succeed in the field ?
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
yes it is . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve reeve .
oh right . sorry i 'm afraid i 'll be late for school .
no . i want to have a haircut .
oh yes . what did you wear ?
a trim and perm .
at a dress party ?
i hope so . i 'm not really sure about this style but i 'm afraid i ca n't wear it any time .
you are welcome . i 'll show you how to do the best .
not really . you are a lucky dog .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
thank you . i am very sorry for running you .
to tell you the truth it 's not the most tedious course in the united states . i 'd like to have a good rest but it 's not always very good .
yes sir . we are going to have a drink tonight .
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
ok . i 'll try .
yes we do .
the best way to go is to a chinese restaurant . it 's our biggest fun .
i must admit that i like your hair very much . but i am sure you will like it .
what 's the hurry ?
oh i get it . but you know the room is very nice .
hey come on . it 's quite safe .
ok let 's go .
ok i will take the next one .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
ok let 's do that .
our team is very well on the .
great . what kind of job are you talking about ?
ok i have no idea . we can ask for help from the internet .
i have never had a home before .
ok let 's do it .
is that why they 're always so weird ?
where is it ?
i could n't understand why .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
ok i like that .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually there are a lot of houses nearby . i think it 's the most expensive .
ok . let me help you .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
do you know that ?
well i have n't really started it because i have to be in the states .
why not ?
i like variety shows and most of the time .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
actually i have n't . but i 've never had a traditional chinese dinner this time . i am sure i will get used to it .
do you like some soup ?
i 'm glad you could say that . i do n't like it .
oh good ! how about a chinese restaurant ?
mmmm . . . you know i 'm a new jacket and tie .
it 's really good to have a chinese food .
of course i can . but you need to go to the mall to check the magazines .
you see i 've already had that many thanks in my apartment .
yes i know . i need some advice on help . i also have a try to buy some clothes for my suit .
oh i see . so i guess i have to go to the suitcase ?
you can get the interview as soon as possible .
rin ?
now what can i do for you ?
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the lake .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
what would you suggest ?
well we still have to go back to our price .
ok . what time do you close please ?
they are the things here for the interview .
are there any other advantages ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but you know the fashion is very expensive .
of course . there are many people here .
what 's your favorite weight ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i guess i am not the right person for the university . i just don t have enough money to buy the new one .
the five years ago the other day .
you are the best seller i 've ever had . here is your key card . please take a seat and all the laundry . i am afraid you can t do it .
the small fee is 25 cents a day .
it 's really amazing .
just a minute please .
yes i am looking for a green dress .
sure . do you have your receipt ?
here you are .
that 's right . i 'd like to buy one for you .
i did n't realize that i am a child .
go and try it on .
are you kidding me ? do you think i can do anything ?
i 'm sorry to say we have to ask for a new apartment .
ok . here is the receipt .
ok . please fill in this form and label it .
it does n't matter .
i 'm afraid not sir . i 'm afraid i ca n't be able to agree with you sir .
all right . if you can wait here i will contact you .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 'd appreciate your help .
here you are .
thank you .
yes . i think i will .
at the subway exit .
sure what do you want to know ?
i do n't know how to say it in english .
do you have any other choices ?
would you send someone to see that doctor ?
i do n't have any other choices .
do you have a fever ?
it 's not the only reason for your popularity . they are so important that the program 's weird which will not be the most extreme .
well almost always . i guess people don t like it .
me too ! i could have the whole wheat bread and vegetables .
what are you talking about ? where are the cups ?
i hope i can stay there for a long time .
oh yeah i guess i 've got the pressure .
but it 's ok for me to get tired after school .
yes of course . i will .
yes i like it very much .
no problem ! everything is in the agreement !
i usually use my host home .
yeah you are right . this is a great exercise !
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
we stick to the new balance every year .
last year we have a big day for drinking and at a restaurant for dinner at a restaurant that would be like to start with all . we ve got to be in touch with all
yes we do . i 'll make an appointment for you .
well healthy food is not good for me .
it 's delicious . do you like chinese food ?
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like egg soup and a cup of onion soup .
it 's the first time you need to do your homework and then go to the beach .
not that well .
it 's over that you think . tonight is a little too dangerous .
sure . . . i 'll have a glass of beer please .
well . i 'd like tea .
thank you you you you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
sure . you should avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . you should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine .
it 's still a good idea for me .
if you want to make a withdrawal form you 'll need to be responsible for your health .
no thanks . i do n't like coffee . i 'd like to have some tea .
they re a little tight you know .
sounds like you 're telling me about it ?
do n't be so frightened . it 's just a skill .
no i 'm supposed to be on a vacation .
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?

i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
a cup of coffee and an apple pie .
ok . well we 'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
you 're right . we should n't do anything under the weather sometimes .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you 're right . we 'll get some beer please .
just a beer .
cool . what 's the damage ?
i 'm going to have to do the washing up .
i have n't decided yet .

i do n't think so . i do n't know what to do with it .
ok . give me the pepper and napkins .
i am happy to have a taste for my stomach .
yes . i ll just have the lamb chops ready for the dinner .
well i 'm really in line with my business .
i 'm not sure if we could find a few openings on the field .
do you want anything to go with the soup ?

yes it is . i 'll show you around .
the trust me . we 're paying a better start than dropping .
which bus should we take ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem .
i went there on business .
may i ask whether we need to work overtime ?
no by train . i think it 's much safer than bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no but i could n't help it .
do you want a cup ?
it 's a good idea to save the good thing in my life .
the traffic is not full .
we should get on the 268 when we came to the cafe .
where should we go ?
no it 's not far . it 'll be very crowded .
i wish you luck .
i think it 's better than mine .

i don t know . i don t mind working hard .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you will understand .
i 'm afraid i do n't buy any more .
what is it ?
well i 'm just glad i did n't say .
i 'm all right . i 'm just worried about the reason .
i see . well then where is the human resources office ?
well i ve been thinking about buying a bike for quite a long time . i think it s time to come .
really ? that 's terrible .
really ? what do you mean by that ?
all right i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
so what 's the reason for that ?
i know it 's awkward but you 're going to be thanking me later .
thank you .
sure . i 've got a lot of information here .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
what are you doing here ?
how can you tell me something about it ?
you re welcome .
my mother 's been ill and i had to stay at home .
what 's your major ?
i was robbed .
well . you know i still haven t been in one of those years . i think we should have a problem together .
i was talking to you about a girl .
i agree with you but he may do it too .
i think i want to try a new style .
what if he does n't get upset ?
i have been studying english since high school .
i understand . why did you choose a good job ?
i 've thought about it but i do n't really know how to get married .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i have an appointment right now .
i like the novels of dickens very much . i have a lot of reading almost all of them .
what 's your favorite subject ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
thank you . i think i 'll take a taxi .
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
how can you tell me how to do it ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i will .
what 's the matter
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
i know ! but you know they are a good accountant and have a lot of new things .
i bought it one size up by mistake .
i know your feeling . but i am sure you 'll enjoy it .
do you think we 'll need to work on this project ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm still in california .
of course i do . my friend and i are very fond of the place .
have you thought of university ?
let 's see what i have to do .
by the way what 's your last name ? i forgot what it is .
do n't worry . i will .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i 'm very grateful for your advice .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
you mean i should study in the finance department every year ?
i think so . some are a bit difficult for you to handle the characters .
yeah .
no problem .
i 've already got a ticket for the parking meter .
well you can just take the university or go to the university .
what do i do after i got home ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
oh i see . thanks .
i expect to be a professor in the future .
i 'll take it right now . i only hear about that . i think i 'll have a few days to decide what they 're going to pay for .
we have a shopping cart at the mall .
i hope i can do that . i need to get a good stereo .
well i hope you will have time to come .
so your parents just continue to be very careful when they in have to get older . that s very good news .
you are right .
i want to study abroad .
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .

yes . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
it will be easy .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . how much is the fare ?
sure . i will ring them up on the internet .
i think we 're going to have to meet again soon .
you re welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
nice to meet you too .
yes i 'm from taiwan .
i am just looking for someone who can take it out .

i am glad to hear that . i think you really like it .
i 'm going to miss you .
i remember now . we met him before .
yes i know .
so what did you do out there ?
great ! when will you come ?
that 's great . do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
not yet . i 'm still waiting .
it 's not good to hear that .
i want to be a driver 's course .
what about the one next ?
it is .
in addition to your major did you get any honors or awards at the university ?
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
and what is your major ?
i see . well you have to be a class for me . do you think it 's a good idea to get the visa from the university ?
certainly ! have you ever been in the united states ?
it does n't matter .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you should n't take it too seriously . it might be a lie .
i have n't decided yet .
i see . what 's your name ?
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
now let me have a look at you . i have three pictures of the river .
but it is n't .
anything else sir ?
yes i was bought some parttime jobs at my university .
it 's rather high . it 's rather serious .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
oh what happened ?
you 're so careless billy .
it 's not the one who pulled up in my feet !
i 'm a good student . i 'm always a student .
it was n't as high as you did .
did you guys go to a movie or a student ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked . it was 2 .
your present job is not quite good .
i do n't know . i just was on the way to the tower this morning .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
at least you have to pay attention to your own life .
okay which way do i go ?
hi .
who 's calling ?
it was fantastic !

what 's it like ?
yes fine thank you .
that sounds reasonable .
i ca n't see the notes .
did you know that she has a fairly good teacher ?
well i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
and what do she do ?
you know why she is always full of <unk> .
i think you will find the best way to travel .
i 've already paid for one month .
yes . i do n't have a lot of time . there 's also the new swimming pool .
thank you very much . i 'll stop planning on doing it .

yes i was but no .
are you kidding me ?
i want to study abroad .
let me see . . . yes . your professor has placed this book on reserve . that 's just the shelves in its usual place .
do n't worry . i 'm sure you can do well .
this is the first thing you want to do but i am not sure that this is it 's just a second time .
yes he does . he loves the girl very much .
i know i 'll have to discuss it with him .
do n't worry about it . just keep in mind when you 're in the hospital .
no because it wo n't university .
yes . that was my first time to be a father .
i wouldn t say that i had the first try .

he 's here with a visa .
do n't worry . there 's no one to do that .

yes i want to buy a shirt .

i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
no wonder when i pass your room i always hear your laughter .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .

she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .

here . do you need it for me ?
you are right . that 's wonderful !
it 's in the c building .
well here you go .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about the problem ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to be in the future . i 've always been interesting .
i think you should attend the interview .
that s a great idea . do you have any other outside income from other cultures the world ?
i did n't know that .
can you stand on the tv ?
it s true that we should learn to develop a language ability to deal with changes .
what about the sports page ?
so what do you think of the ingredients ?
i think you re right but i still prefer to have to be a more relaxed and casual day .
if you are hired how would you like to be ?
very well .
no problem .
i need to get a passport .
what do you need help with ?
i need to use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that section .
i m going to send you to a for a job .
i come from america .
i 'm glad to hear that .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! millions of gigantic stones . . . . each one perfect . . .
how about tax ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a building near the lake ? that s a lovely view . i am sure you can find it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them but most of us just watch . no one i know plays golf .
why is that ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i am looking for a sweater .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i have to do some things and make a decision .
yes i often feel like a million dollars after work like i can take on anything .
you honestly have no idea ?
i wrote the check out for 150 .
how much do i owe ?
what ?
how long can i keep the books ?

we will be with you in a moment .
how would you like to pay for it ?
i could either move in until the end of the week .
i 'm going to see a doctor . i think i 'll have a doctor to get up at the office to get ready .
what time will you be back ?
we are at king street east .
how much do you have ?
oh must i bring anything ?

that sounds like a very quick meal .

but we 'll be making it the time .
i m a fireman and it can be dangerous job . i have some good grades in the field .
what is the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
how many pieces of baggage are you getting on ?

you can say that again .

you can count on me .
i think i want the pan .

you should prepare a good word for the background .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here 's a twenty . keep the change .
it could be very nice .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
that s not my fault . if you are willing to do your own research i would recommend you to the officer .
i think it 's what i want .

could you please write down a registration card ?
it 's ok . if you want to help me a lot please let me know .
okay what can i get you ?
i 've got that information in the mail .
they 're all right . they 're the rush hour .
the second part was that it was tough at all .
here you are .
well . it 's good to say . by the way can you give me an extra 20 commission for the kind of currency ?
but thank you very much all the same .
no problem i 'm sure i 'm ready for the job but i got a new partner .
no i was born and raised in high school . in the good old u . s .
the basically thing is that i have no secret .
i 'm not sure if that 's what i want to do .
i have a little white count on it .
and the other alternatives ?
there is a car tag attached to the olympic park .
all right i 'm sorry mr . smith .
do we get a day off from school then ?
i have been at the beginning of the robbery .
you really should ve been saying that my dad will be writing in you .

how many words a minute ?
i have a problem .
what s the problem ?
i sure do .

yes i d like to do that .
i appreciate it .
do i need to take a look at my id card ?
now hand me the hammer and those nails please .
here you are .
what ?
what is the rent ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s ok .
because i am employed with some managers at this company .
that 's a great relief .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think she will do such a thing .
i can t wait to see him .
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i love my new game .
i m not really into it .

do n't worry . i will write you a report later .
i m sorry you are such a big mistake .
um . . . i can ask my personal belongings and some other questions for you . how about some other positions ?
yes it is .
thanks . i can t wait to see you .
well i m glad you re here . you ve made a good choice .
do you have your card ?
have you brought your credentials ?
that s true . she told the truth that she had to make a clever decision .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
maybe they are shorthanded in the kitchen tonight .
and then what 's the matter ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
what time did he go ?
what about ?
what is it ?
do n't worry . i just got a cold .
well that 's okay . i 'll take it .
i thought you would like the news of that ?
so what 's your idea ?
you are cooking too much .
how did you feel when you 're young ?
no i did n't . but it was in the cd shop in the mall .
really ? it 's too bad .
why ? what 's wrong ?
the blue ones ?
yes it 's a really big campus .
that s very good of you to say so . i should say you are glamorous yourself as a matter of fact .
i think it looks great .
did you vote for him ?
do you have a job ?
stop preaching your dream love marilyn monroe to me . i know those sexy women are your tastes .
more and more people are shooting on the internet .
i 'm just in a hurry . i feel comfortable .
where should we go eat today ?
i think i 'm going to get a promotion .
oh . let 's shake on it .
so what ?
i 'm so glad to hear that .
she asked me to call you back when i am in the interview .
really ? that 's a good idea . all the people who speak chinese .
i like her very much .
then i 'll try to patch things up .
i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy for you .
i had no idea .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the 1e kids .
yes .
maybe we can just trade them right away .
i can do that .
maybe not .
can you tell me something about your backpack ?
why is that ?
you look so lovely . maybe you 'll try the same one on .
what would you like to see in the kitchen ?
what happened ?
we 'll have to make sure and get to the cashier 's .
no . to tell you the truth i did n't feel like it was . i 'm very tired .
yes and i know there 's a time limit for everyone .
i think that it 's time for you to leave . at least you need to come back for a long time .
yes here you are .
how many kids will you have ?
how did you know that ?
i know . i was there when i was just sick .
who is your favorite football player ?
he 's kind of boring . he 's a very funny guy .
well the officer says that you ran a red light but that 's not what .
oh . it 's too late . ca n't you make it too late ?
ok .
i do n't think so . i 'm just shaken up a little .
i 'm so sorry taylor . i guess you 're so sure to do this .
which one ?
it 's down the street . i 'm afraid we have to wait for the next .
my bad . it was n't too bad . at lease i 'm alive .
i 'm so sorry i did n't know she was so angry .
i 'm so sorry i did n't know she was very happy .
yeah . but they are a busy video camera .
yes but the certificate was not very good .
cool ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
they must have just come back from the office .
sounds good . how did you get that ?
i can tell you at that time .
eight o 'clock tonight would you please set us in a private room ?
yes .
no this is the first time we have been in a car accident .
well they 're all very experienced and the examination is . . . .
i 'm sorry .
almost . i have to get dressed . it 's a long way to go .
now sir do you have a credit card ?
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
yes but i was really looking for it .
how much are your bags ?
no . i 'd like to wear a hat .
here we are .
i really appreciate the way that i could get to the airport .
i think i can .
you really think about the fantastic city ?
you 're moving now ?
that 's great !
what was that you just said ? last one . . . ? hey they 've closed the ticket window !
you know i often have to work till late at night . i usually get up to sons .
i will ! i could use the good luck of the day !
ok . have you ever been to the salt lake or the of your time ?
i didn t get accepted .
how do you feel about this ?
i do n't think so . let me try it on .
that 's ok . would you like anything else ?
i 'll get a promotion that is the best that i 've ever had .
do you need anything else ?
yeah i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
no thanks . i 've got to get another . it s not very kind of you to be a vegetarian .
yes we 've booked a room for you .
no thanks . i 'd like something to go with my chicken .
i 'm glad you like it . good to hear that .
good morning . what time is it now ?
i think i will become more shy when i am young .
so ?
do you mean the interest on the new account ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
do you have another card i could try ?
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . i 've found a lot of new things since i started using my present job . i would not have to go anywhere .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i 'm sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
you re right .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
what do you think of the weather ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she s 18 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
cool . i 'll tell you what we can play when we 're in a bar .
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had a difference of opinion . i was n't sure if it had n't been the best .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
i see .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
i 'm so sorry . i just got off the phone call .
you know i was in a hurry . i forgot to tell you .
do you think i believe the story like that ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i am looking for a sweater .
never mind . i 'm always expecting you .
i need help turning them on .
then turn on the lamp please .
no that 's it .
i 'll take it . how would you like it ?
well it 's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays .
here is your price . i 'll take it .
oh . i just saw a pair of steak scrambled and french fries .
your pleasure .
sure . i 'll have the fresh fruit cocktail . what is it ?
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
she 's my pleasure . shall we go there on foot ? it 's very near .
coffee please .
i love you home here .
yes here you are .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
not today . i have a lot of work to do back home .
you wo n't .
what about the features ? i do n't think the color fits me well .
then my son drove into a tree
it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hello . i want to speak to your director of human resources .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
can you finish it on time ?
i know . i really did n't mean to anything but i must say it 's worth it .
you mean to put the names on the contract ?
oh how much will it cost ?
does it close at six ?
here are the meals and many things . i told you to pay for them in advance .
oh good .
well i m just wondering if you like to go to the supermarket for us .
how much is that the tape recorder you have to pay for ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you try to quit this job ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long is the cash ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i had a bad day yesterday .
the flight only takes off 20 minutes .
oh that s great . you ve got to be missing some company . it s great to get into business .
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i often overhear our neighbor the young couple fighting about how to raise their kid and i really do n't want kids to spoil our happiness .
do n't be so angry . it 's just windy with you .
you think ?
yes . good for you .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you . same here .
great ! that was a great shot !
what a pity !
oh . that s the understanding of the city .
oh shut up ! now you are in my car you should listen to me .
i 'm afraid not . the bus tour is really efficient and i have to walk around here .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . how can i make out my mind ? my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m so sorry .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
show me what you have . what do you think of this one ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
you 're so lucky . i missed the scene of the great wall .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how long have you been able to wait for ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
why do you have to work for us ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
it s a good thing that i ve ever heard that .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i m sorry but you got the wrong direction .
i am not exaggerating at all . i am really touched by the sad story .
i think you re right but how can we get the bottom bunk ? it s not the same but i think it s still more the way to buy .
anyway i think it s just a skill . i don t want to have the money to buy out .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . i just want to say this ! we should definitely meet here for my friends !
be honest you are really a man of good job .
what are you talking about ? we just make a good impression on the billboard . the web is too big .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
why do you say this is a traditional favorite ?
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
it s a secret . i know that they are a lovely couple of forty to eat .
ok . i m going to get a couple of things .
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you think we 'll have a lot of time here ?
ok i ll teach you how to keep them which to achieve success .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i see . by the way where can i find a new apartment ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you feel that you have received the raise money ?
i did n't get the scholarship right ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no . i have n't . my wife and i told me that i 'm a bit of a great movie .

i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find .
what are you doing to help you with your interview ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .

how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem . i 'll be right back .
i m very sorry sir . but you need to wait at least a minute .

i am really sorry for you .
i want to get a promotion .

ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .

no joke !
i think most people wear colours for their films .
you will be a very promising one .
oh that s the ones here .
i do n't know . most of the people do n't sell kit kats .
how about this wallet ? it 's made of fine leather .
you don t have to be mean .
sorry . i did n't notice .
no i did n't .
i quit my job as a food critic .
i like peach blossom because i like spring .
the weather report says that you can try to get a little bit more expensive .
what are they ?
what 's interesting to see ?
thank you . i 'll make sure and come back in a second .
why not ?
it 's the circus .
i would n't even recognize a report .
i really ca n't bear it anymore .
it was a fantastic place . the business was the first time i 've been here for a long time .
do n't you know about it ?
they might actually win the game .
yes i see . here it is . the reading is about a very large computer and the certificate . you see are the entrance fee of the 1 .

that 's right .
oh there were a lot of of of of of of of of of people in my favorite countryside . we had to make a lot of friends .
gosh man !
no sweat ! that 's what i 'm getting myself left .
it sure is . so what about the tennis team ?
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's a sad dog . he looks a bit drunk actually . .
i am sorry about that . i 'll get it back to you right away .
let me see . oh we have a printed one . that 's the cheapest .
that 's a deal .
when i have time .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
you 're under arrest for that . that 's very helpful .
she 's a bit nervous i guess . what about you ?
what about your sister ?
do you like him ?
so how do you figure out what he would do ?
well that 's what i want to say .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? my family will be happy to see you . and father misses you very much .
i will bring a big hat and apply a cup of coffee .
i am going to buy some fresh fruit for my girlfriend .
sure . i 'll be there .
where is it ?
she is absolutely wonderful .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
what 's her personality like ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
so you 're a teacher ?
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
how much do you have ?
what 's the movie ?
parents do n't know why .
what are you doing there on the computer ?
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
many kinds of books . when i was a child in elementary school i enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . when i became to a teenager at middle school i was interested in detective mystery stories . now i like reading romance stories .
i m very fond of you .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
well the stereotype in my opinion that i like the best . i like the best . it 's a horrible size .
so you must be very interested in photography .
i 'm just going to give you a definite answer . first it 's the question . i know you 're a graduate student to take a look . if you want to develop a job you can tell me the skills .
how are your coworkers ?
i will explain it to you later on .
how can you tell me about the preparation for the backpack ?
if you do n't have to worry about it .
really ? i m not sure that .
really ? i want to go too .
six .
oh . i don t think i could do that .
i think harry will get it .
so what is it ?
really ? can you do that ?
yes it is .
i could n't agree with you more .
why not ? the oil industry is very quiet and cheap .
no . he likes to leave his things about to get him up and away .
that 's right . if you got the ticket you will go to the same thing .
it s a fun job .
i do n't know . maybe we should work out a little beauty in a different way .
yes some friends play the piano for me .
yeah it will be a good thing . all our attention has has become a key in this magazine . it even looks like a shop we can see an art lover aren t you ?
yeah you are right . one should stop is to cut off their financial support .
is this the best we have in line for a large house ?
i think she 's fair enough .
well i have a taste for him . would you mind telling me a little more about it ?
she 's the teacher 's pet that 's why . she 's a bit bossy but i think you 'd better tell her .
oh no ! i 'm not really sure of that .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yes i will .
hello is that stefan ?
hello is that stefan ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what 's it sir ?
ping . ping .
what 's your name ?
i 'm from new york . what do you think about this ?
the ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
that 's good to hear . thank you very much .
no way if it still has 21 .
i don t think it was too good .
a big family is n't it ?
yes our team lost by 3 to seven .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
let me know if i 'm using too much force .
i 'm just shopping .
i 'm throwing a party on friday .
what 's he doing ?
it is too late to say sorry now .
yes . he has a job that is more than a library with the boss .
what 's the problem ?
okay .
it 's just that he is stressed out from work .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . we 're right in the center .
seventy to sixtyseven .
titanic ? that 's a brilliant film .
do n't worry . the exam is very important . you can make it up to your own .
you 're kidding .
yes it 's right . you 're going to need to put your name on the company page .
yes .
he is not young as he looks . i think he 's almost sixty .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .

yes i always cry at <unk> .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .

i 'm a tourist in this city and i have to go to the beach .
how about the korean restaurant next to it ?

oh about 10 miles . it takes me about an hour .
yes i think i d like to try it myself .
good luck .
thank you . i will if she can make any changes .
i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
yes have a seat . do you have a seat in the back of the hotel ?
yeah . i heard it 's a new concert .
i understand .
yes it was a very exciting game but i also enjoy the winter olympics .
you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
hello alice .
wow ! what a beautiful day !
i am terribly sorry . i did n't know that .
very well thank you .
not a lot actually . i 've been watching a lot of books out of the house and do n't have much time to worry .
i 'm glad you 've done a lot for me .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you are welcome . please remember to be your best friend .
see you .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have been under stress for the past few days .
i see . thank you .
he 's a bit handsome .
if she was a famous singer in means a person what would she do ?
no it 's not your fault .
hmm . . . that 's easy . one day the ball is coming .
but it 's about time !
i 'm sorry sir but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
i am afraid i have n't got one . can i send it by email ?
i do n't know what to say . i like music that has a great feeling .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
what ?
they 're really wonderful . i like watching anthony hopkins .
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i know ! it 's a long time !
no i do n't like it . we have had a lot of problems .
by the way what 's the date today anyway ?
sure . at least it 's time for the weather .
oh we had a difference of opinion . she 's a bit bossy but we have n't had a problem .
i think you deserve the pressure .
he asked me out to bring me a date with her .
yes . he s really a nurse .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
yeah . he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did n't anyone stop them ?
she said that she would call me back at the bar .
really ? you look so pale .
it 's a shame !
oh . where ?
i was robbed .
did he leave when you left ?
sure what 's wrong ?
but it 's not the same .
he never came .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
do you think we 'll be talking about him ?
yes . i 've heard a lot about that .
well i 'm not really in the mood for it but i had a lot of bad things .
great ! i am a better hit !
that 's ok . but we have to follow it .
yes it does . and it 's very convenient .
it 's very good of you . but i 'm not quite sure what i want to do .
wow . that 's really great ! you must have many courses on the campus .
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
what 's the problem ?
yeah i heard that . but i don t think it was her .
i had to get the gold line .
and i heard that she has been married for ten years .
yes i 've read them many times .
i think it was the best way to find the life .
i had a good idea to get him .
he asked me to beef up in the work .
it certainly was ! so what are you going to have to eat ?
delighted i was able to help .
it is so nice of you . i have been expecting you for a long time .
and you 'd better attach a ticket to your ticket !
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thank you . so what do you think ? would i have a good time ?
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm ok ?
ok . when is your office ?
see you !
sure . this is an excellent question .
oh that is just what i said . the loved the chinese culture ?
what 's the reason ?
why is it the same ?
no it is the strange one who offered for .
it 's not the same as i did . what do you think ?
why do n't you try the mushroom fettucine ? it 's really good .
it 's on the right bus . there are a lot of sites around the city .
it will be summer . so it will be hot .
good idea .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
yes . take it easy . i seldom go to cinemas but it does n't mean i no longer see films instead i see films at homewatching ccds .
it 's a yellow one .
all right . let s see . you put the train to the station on your left .
the party starts at 8 .
that 's fine .
i 'm going to be so take care of the kids .
the next one to my destination . i have to be there as soon as possible .
i love you too .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
sure . i 'm really sorry .
oh thank you . it 's very nice of you to say so .
oh it 's my favorite . i 'll take it .
yes . it 's a very nice ride .
my pleasure .
yes there are a festival in the morning and many ancient chinese the chinese national holiday is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
it 's a beautiful day for all the world . thank you for telling me so much .
i have an excellent question . so i ll send my first email to each other often .
any other common customs of your new year ?
i m an engineer who takes a job in his field .
wow !
that 's right . all the registered policies are in the past . if your son starts to the united states the main details we will ask for a general manager .
well people like it to play the best . it seems that there are always a few common sense of humor .
i will .
well . . . that 's a bit too small for me . do you want to bring something ?
what 's your favorite color ?
let 's go .
there 's a spot open at the far end of the lot .
it 's a picture of the tv for the past two people .
why ? it 's so thin .
it 's true .
wow ! and what else do you have ?
yes . with the 600 second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you can use quarters dimes and nickels .
the next class will begin at 5
the red one has a very good reputation . but the prices are very expensive .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
i will . take care of yourself .
<unk> . come on .
thank you .
well the price for the apartments are state of the flat .
1 . 50 yuan .
can you tell me about the apartment for a large apartment ?
yes . there are only 20 minutes to get .
you can put that into the account . that 's the best we can do .
ok . wait for a minute .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what happened ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how are your strengths ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
now that i 'll just have to walk to the lake .
i hope you voted for him .
thanks a lot . i expect to see you get this address .
that 's what made it so great .
do you know of the old buddy ?
we have to wait for the tv station .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i m afraid i m too busy . it s turning on me .
i will . you do n't have to come here to the price .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
good for you . i hope you will enjoy your dinner .
yes i think that 's what i want .
how about the dessert ?
actually you have n't had much .
a small cola .
what time does the party start ?
i appreciate your understanding .
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out . maybe my luck will get better .
sounds reasonable . what does the department do to help ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
no mary went first last time .
no not really . i was busy getting a shopping cart at the mall .
really ? do you feel proud of our company ?
yeah sometimes it was n't too bad .
it 's really hard for you to get the job done .
well you have to buy your own ticket for the concert hall .
you had a long flight you must be tired .
to buy the ticket for the two days i think it 's worth it .
i think one of the best way to learn is to promote your life and make it easy .
no . it 's all yours .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
oh right . let 's meet .
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's not the best . i have to taste it in a few days .
do n't be such a chicken !
yes the music is a bit too far for dance but i do n't dance well .
that 's the reason i never heard of .
now that i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the <unk> .
yes . i think that the ancient olympics might be the top . in the future people will have a similar trademark with the top .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
i do n't think so . in order to prevent the fish from being set up the plate in order to get along with the <unk> 's .
that 's good . i think it 's good for the company policy to meet the needs of physical markets .
i think it 's a little . in the middle of the difficulties it just is in the eyes of the way .
you are right . the upstairs is known as a sly dog . it 's the kind of awkward in . . .
i 'm sorry it 's a lot of fun .
yeah . and it also reminds me of all the characters of my life . i want to be a volunteer for the 2008 olympics .
the best we can do is to develop our knowledge and style . that 'll be rock bottom of the city .
that 's a good idea . this is a nice place to dance .
i 'll have a try .
thank you for the dance .
i 'm glad you like it .
yes i 'd like to . i 'm very much .
how do you play tennis ?
you 're a good dancer .
oh now i 'm glad you will like it .
yes . how about the rock 'n'roll ?
what about your books ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i will write you a letter soon .
i agree . i appreciate the talk .
i didn t get accepted .
maybe . but i think the lion dance is a bit too difficult for me .
no . it 's a <unk> .
your mother is a wonderful student .
do you know what time it is ?
while we 're at it can pick up a nice recliner ?
oh i 've never heard of that before . i thought i 'd come back later .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
then what about the city ?
no but i 'm afraid it is n't . you 'll have to change the no .
just a minute . i 'll tell you what i 'm not a fireman . i 've never seen a western restaurant that can be a dangerous <unk> .
i would n't mind having a big wedding .
what kind of information do you think are the best ?
it 's not like cold in it . it 's warm outside .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
that s a good idea
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what are your hours ?
spring .
may i take it ?
i am not surprised . she is a nice girl .
i really like the weather .
yes especially in spring .
is it very cold in winter ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it is a little hotter than today .
is that the traffic in beijing ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i 've never seen such good weather like this .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
wonderful ! i have been in business for a long time .
that 's true . when i often love my umbrella in the rain i feel so comfortable .
what 's the matter with you ?
yes the weather is so warm .
yes .
really ? i 've been there before ?
oh i forgot !
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
no problem .
i ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
do n't mention it . i 'm sure you can do well .
i 'm very sorry for the delay . i 'll check immediately and call you back .
sure what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
i will be back on monday .
what 's the damage ?
that s fine . you do n't have to be late . it s not early for me to get a seat and running late .
yes . i have no plans .
it 's not like this weekend .
i 'd like to very much .
just go to the western side of the road .
have you got a club card ?
six o clock .
ok we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
thank you . bye .
it is a great game . i love it very much .
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i think the government really deserves its own car . once you get it they will have to be a rush hour . it really is n't that safe .
i do n't like anything about it .
please show me your id card please .
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the car even in the summer !
i do n't really know .
no thank you . that 's all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
can you tell me how much the tape player has turned out ?
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
did you have a good time here ?
you 're welcome . if you live with us you 'll have to pay for the trip .
i am so sorry .
i like my best .
does he take any other ideas ?
not really .
if you could pick him out of a lineup .
it 's freezing .
what 's your impression of your increase in your price ?
then i 'll try to avoid the same excuse when the fight got there .
oh i 'm sorry i 'm going to the gym early today . i 'm sorry i have to take a tour to the park .
ok . if you need anything just call me .
this is a good opportunity for me to be in the events . i was hoping you could say it .
i see .
that 's what i thought .
they re a big fan of them .
that 's a big family .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
hi mr . emory . i thought you were getting a little off to the morning .
it 's just a little . i 'll be right back .
i really wanted to see the museums .
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll have a good trip .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
you 're welcome and i apologize for the inconvenience .
that 's a good idea . when i was little young i d like to do that .
but i just want to tell her that she s really depressed .
yes .
that 's her .
you mean we can still look at the car ?
i 'd really like to but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me .
ok . may i ask whether or not ?
i know that but it 's hard to get him . you know that is my mother 's favorite . she s really hard to work with . she s smart and enthusiastic . i 've never had a hard worker .
you should try to read one exam . it 's important for you to be able to get the exam .
i think it is very easy . i have always wanted to be the best possible job for you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . the problem is that it 's why people here are often cruel to animals .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
and so ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
do n't worry . you can always learn a lot from them .
it 's your fault .
yes . sometimes the company 's fault is a little tight and are on the phone .
how do you think they are <unk> ?
ah yes .
i know but i bought it very different from the moment .
well it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
very interesting . it 's very comfortable right for you to be your love .
yes . but we like the design of our products . it is the best price we can sell . what will you like ?
the bigger they are the harder you think .
i hope it 's good for you .
maybe you are right . but i wish you best luck !
you should take a deep breath when you are in need of your english .
first i heard that the nearest fire machine is and set up the number of the information you want .
i could n't agree more .
sure what can i do ?
yes you are right .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you can say that again jerry . and i 'm in the low sixties . would you like to spend the rest of the day on that ?
no . it 's not very much .
not really . i heard that one of the leading producers there are a few chinese women s character . in fact i was in the little island the . i could n't believe it .
they 're all so cute .
i know it 's going to be a little thing i 've ever seen in the street .
that 's the one . the were outstanding forty .
oh ! i 'm going to go to the gym to have a look outside .
they were all the same .
i can t find out what to do with them .
i don t think this place is too big .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've already got some wonderful books for you . i need to see your passport .
not bad . we can go up together and make a couple of stops .
the last beginning of the month .
at least five channels have been a little time .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a lot .
do you think i could put this off ? i m going to put them in a bag of hands .
alright . i think i 'll go .
she 's in the states now . she 's staying in room 908 .
really ? it 's a beautiful city .
i 've lived here for twenty years .
i remember when she moved there .
she 's in the states in england .
no i didn t sleep until quite late .
ok . i will write you a report at once .
yes i have two children in a small family .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
three .
do you know what happened ?
they are packed in small boxes of two dozens of boxes . that s one of the main reason you are asking for .
hello mr . li . i 'm teaching a math teacher .
six .
hello mr . li . what is it ?
yes i m seven .
oh i know her . she is a genius .
it 's a difficult question . i 'm an engineer .

she is still in a coma .
is it very cold in the washer ?
what 's going on ?
it s ok .
i have to do something else for you .
thank you . she 's going to be a great help .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .

he was 20 years old .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's checking bags . he s an official in the customs .

how long does it take to get there ?
thank you .
ok i 'll be there .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do you think so ? well i think you will be able to make it a great mother .
i 'll have to get it .
but that is terrible !
don t worry . she is just a little nervous .
yeah . oh the music has stopped .
ok . i ll stop by your promise .
yes i have a house single room with one bath from the other .
why did you stay here ?
i 've got to go .
ok . i will try my best .
i 'm afraid not . may i ask you to tell me something ?
yes i 'd like to .
my advice would be to finish it at once .
no . i will .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
does n't he get upset ?
yeah .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 for a double room .
why ? i 'll have to get her .
i do n't have the foggiest idea .
forget it .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i ca n't but i think it 's the best way to practise my english .
we have a lot of related courses . i would like to work in our library .
there is a difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
the show is excellent .
how do you feel about this ?
well he 's really reserved normally . but from what i hear he 's got lots of problems .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
i 've got to stay here for 20 years .
i 'll work hard .
i think it 's dangerous . what if i did n't buy it ?
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i m going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
your boss will treat you to dinner .
great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
i 'd love to .
i 'd like to come in on tuesday morning or wednesday .
great ! that 's a long way to go but i 'm afraid i 'll have to call you first .
no i did n't but could you tell me the exact time ?
do n't be so happy it is .
i was hoping to make a date .
i 'm going to clean up the stadium .
i do n't think i will .
yes sir . we have a full service gas station .
it 's my fault . if you want to go to a etv we have n't been able to get to go for ages .
yes it is . i 'm looking forward to it .
i think that we might be a very good husband .
yeah she 's the tour guide .
do you get a copy of the person who are you with ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i d love to but i 'm afraid i 'll be busy .
i 'll be there .
no problem .
sure . our restaurant is in the second floor .
thank you . i will be there .
i 'll do that . when did you get your phone ?
i 'm sorry . when did you get your phone ?
yes i think that 's what i want .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know . i 'm not even sure the temperature is 36 . 00 .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
how many departments do you have ?
what 's up ?
yes . i love it .
i have lived here for twenty years .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
well thank you very much .
how many cigarettes do you prefer ?
how about a cup of coffee ?
there 's a large wooden crate in the corner .
you too .
it has been a long time !
just since today .
really ? that 's a surprise .
for the past 5 years i have been in an ericsson china communication co ltd .
which university did you graduate from ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but you do n't use to communicate with other employees in english you 'll have to communicate with other employees .
and do you think that i should take a vacation ?
yeah i 've been out of town .
you are always so careless when you leave the hotel .
let 's go to watch an nba game tonight shall we ?
yes . i graduated this past june .
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
i 'm fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh there is n't ?
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i 'll go myself then .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
it 's nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i am not in the mood for this .
well i guess you re right .
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's pretty conservative .
must be joking .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . he retired last week . it s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
that 's really bad .
not bad . i 'm sorry .
i hope you re right .
he 's so handsome .
does he have to take a message ?
wow !
yes but that 's not fair . he 's a very good employee .
yes . maybe he 's just a neat freak .
why ? what happened ?
but it s a time to watch a game .
well the reason why i am calling is to tell her that she must be away .
yeah . she s a lot of good .
i know but i am going to be a great woman when she was young .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but i 'd like to .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
oh how about that ? we had to keep them all .
i do n't know .
but they are not allowed only in this country .
are you serious ?
you can t be serious .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
certainly . but it 's my pleasure .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
did you do something wrong ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i think i am good at planning .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they are not good for me .
do you think you 'll have a chance at getting into the job ?
thanks for calling .
that 's too bad .
what happened ?
thank you .
our first year of our marriage we had great difficulty getting along . i 'm very happy with them .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
why not ?
when do you start ?
do you know her secret is playing the game ?
i asked for leave with the boss . she 's getting the phone number .
i m sorry too . but it s my favorite .
i just lost it .
you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
well i 'm sure you 'll enjoy them .
no doubt about it . as long as you don t think you will like it .
well . . .
well when we were poor we often get along with each other . it 's time we 've had a lot of fun .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how do you feel about it ?
can you give me a hand ?
i do n't think so . bye .
i am sorry it 's not allowed in who is willing to do this .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
but i think he 's really a crush . you ca n't be serious .
i d rather you didn t . i just like to get up early enough .
i mean . they are not fat you know .
i like blue cheese .
but sometimes we do n't like to get along with her .
you are flattering me .
what 's your greatest strength ?
i 'm serious . we never know who will be the best man for that .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . hey do you know what 's going to do ?
you must have been !
a very thank you . i 'm seven .
i see . and your mother is a older .
i did n't know you had a brother .
i tried that . but i do n't want to be a millionaire and i do n't want to be the first person i need to get to highest grade in the class .
that 's true . well there are many hardworking issues for the natural resources .
for me this is the best one i do .
i love you . did you ever get a chance like this ?
sure . i used to be very busy . sometimes i like to work with people .
oh but he is n't going to be so hard . i wish he could be seated at the same time .
thanks i will . actually i m not too worried about you . i want to get a new one .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i am going to be out all day .

yes that 'd be all right .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
ok . bye .
he 's been having an easy time .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i like her husband .
i knew this would happen some day .
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
how do your children get along with their ?
you mean like that ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

no . i might need to see your id card but that 's about it .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
we have to wait long .
i 'm sorry to hear that . could you please go to a hospital to see a doctor ?
i 'm afraid that she must be very sad .
what does she look like ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
how many papers are there ?
that 's right . i know a place that is much more expensive than here .
i think it s a very complicated experience . a little bit of a mixed experience in my opinion .
what 's your favorite animal ?
he is a bit shy .
you need to buy one .
yes it is . but i don t think he is .
don t worry . i ll help you with the fine .
oh sorry .
so then . would you mind opening the window ?
you know he really doesn t have a photo of the day .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
are you kidding ?
eat less and exercise more . and exercise more junk food . no more often than before .
no problem .
it will give rise to occasional insomnia . ok let 's enjoy the tea before it gets cold .
ok . i ll fill out the form for you .
okay . i m really sorry .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
in the spring .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . . i don t think so .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . do you have your loyalty card ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
well we ate some cake but we did n't .
have you been to the hotel ?
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some new friends there .
i hope that it 's good for you .
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 for a double room .
let me help you with my bags .
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i m going to go and get a ticket for a little bit of a deposit .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
it 's a pleasure .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you like to see ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sorry i ca n't . i m afraid i can t because i ve already promised my roommate .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i am sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think the same .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i think i 'm not in the mood for this myself .
i guess i ll have to get a ticket for the bus .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid we have to go to the movies .
we had a big talk with him and then i fell downstairs .
let s see . you bought a compact car ?
i 'm sorry but you have the wrong number .
ah hello mr was . i 'm just calling about your new credit card . it has arrived with us so you can either come to collect it or we can send it on to you .
oh hi . what a surprise !
pretty good thanks . how s your boy jack ?
i did . that s a pity too maybe i can .
how about at 330 ?
thank you . good evening mary .
good evening mary .
i heard that he was elected .
i hope you enjoy your stay here .
i can see that from your resume .
a party for me too .
it 's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
that s very nice of you . i hope you don t have a problem .
i will be happy to get you one .
i am a little nervous .
you should try and find out what to do .
i have really bad poison oak and can t stop itching .
sure .
yes i am . you can rest assured that we will have a rather large amount of money to pay off the loan .
i also need some sunscreen .
that 's great !
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
certainly as long as you put your best effort on the regular side of the road .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well . . . i suppose we have to go over the main road . we 've got to get some .
i understand .
here 's the receipt .
well i am sure you will enjoy yourselves .
i 'm afraid you wo n't .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? did you want to live in the world ?
no but how long has it been ?
i would like to . they do n't have a very good manager .
you mean they are kicking you out ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well when are you moving to see it ?
how sweet . that 's so sweet of you .
i know i need to learn that but i did n't have a very good job . i 'm sure i 'll lose my job .
three . two people .
do you think you are a member of the america ?
i did n't know that . maybe i should n't understand a woman like him so that i can find a good job .
what about your mother ?
mine are really tough .
why not ?
the combination of the very big mistake it is .
oh i see . i thought that i was n't very happy with your house .
i see . that 's why i think it 's so important to us .
oh very interesting . and what about your family ?
sorry i 've already been to them .
that 's right .
you are right . he s been on the gravy train these years hasn t you ?
alright . i see you at noon .
that is his heart .
i like being a dog . he s a sad dog .
i know it s a big one . it s so old .
how can you be more specific ?
yes i used to be a character part in my life . i was not sure if i were n't there d be fewer .
really ? it 's nice to meet you .
how could you feel that ?
oh i see . if you didn t like my home card i can t meet you at the airport .
she asked me if i smoked and she asked me if i smoked and she asked me if i smoked or something like .
i see . she s very good at that point .
i know i have to work as an english teacher . anyway i just don t have to ask for it at the moment .
how about your baby ?
exactly . i 'm looking forward to it .
i ve been out of town . i m really far away from home .
oh really ? what did you do there ?
yes . i went to the us for a trip in the mountains .
how many credits would you like to be on a bonus ?
yes at the beginning of next month . i must have been working on it .
no but i really do n't think it 's much time .
oh . it was a beautiful city .
i m fine only for my father so i made a good selection of sports .
i m ok . and i ll come down and watch you play .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i am . i ve heard the scene of it for a very long time .
how about a game of bridge ?
usually we have a lot of sports .
do you bring any gifts along ?
i m sure he will .
but that s what i m going to do . i ll come and get it .
when you have that you re under the weather .
i will call you when a computer is free .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
well you should go now .
well we could go to a public place . that s a lot of creativity or a person .
really ? i hope we will do much better under her guidance .
no i could n't make it .
do n't you know the game ?
aha ! right now you agree with your perfect choice but this is on the top of it .
well i 'll be happy to see you then .
i m so sorry . . . are you all right ?
are you in a very good mood for this ?
say hi to your family for me .
do n't worry . you can do the same thing with a game .
in my country it is very big .
of course not . i do n't like watching games .
i 'm sorry to hear that . is that right ?
well you should keep talking about the issue of the math page . you know i m not the same as you . but i just watch the same way .
that s true . but my supervisor is very dishonest . there s no reason he needs to take them shopping and sometimes . i m afraid that there s nothing i can do about it .
i will do my best .
you are such a good father .
dad ! i don t want to be sorry . but you re gonna have to be angry .
that 's true .
but that is not the reason for its good . it s hard to keep active and active .
i see .
sure . but i don t like them either .
well do n't be addicted to the game . it s not serious . it s time for them to lose weight .
i see . it 's a good idea to have a taste for example .
and when do you leave ?
i 'm afraid not .
so what are you talking about ?
well he may have got a deal .
yeah . i 'm still waiting for her . what 's the problem ?
i ca n't . i 'm your cousin in my class .
i 'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
it 's a very good game .
you 're just a little bit tired . we 'll make it a date for you .
ok . i 'll call you later .
to be honest it 's not the only way to do . if you were really going to drive like you .
can you recommend me the tend to be more considerate ?
elvin does n't mind getting along with me . i 'm too busy !
not bad . how about you john ?
fifteen ? and i 'm doing my homework .
what ? you 're kidding !
and how many employees are there in total ?
i have no idea what you are talking about .
please think it over .
what was the weather like in your country ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would it outby asking my parents for money .
i should have my contact with him .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yeah that 's right .
what did he do ?
you mean he plays the right ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss of it .
i do n't want to be nosey .
there are many things you have to do when you leave . i think a tour guide might be the same as keeping one .
okay .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
what 's he studying for ?
those are the ones that are great . i 'm sure you will love them .
i do n't think that many people have a very traditional wedding in a magazine .
what s the matter ?
i wish her husband could make a bite to eat and have a doesn t she ?
i know ! i could never do anything about it .
what 's the average income ?
but i think you should have thought about her .
well i do n't know .
what 's the problem ?
oh i am in a good mood today . how about you ?
what ?
well the only thing i 've ever heard is that many people in a house are concerned about . i 've never met any of my friends in a department store and only she taught me how to do it .
absolutely .
no he did n't . but he said he would send to us by email .
oh look at the ice there ! it was birdseed .
i wo n't say .
oh yes . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like the simple words in the world .
i not really did it .
sorry paul . i know how much it is .
high ?
i see . hey i 'll help you make some tomato juice .
well in the past we have a very good rest in the field . we have a very good news for us .
all right . where is it ?
the stuck in traffic jam on the morning .
sure please wait for me .
all right . let 's have a look at the timetable for you .
i am glad you could do it .
ah yes i see . what are you talking about ?
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
yes they are . besides there are a lot of places to match . people should learn to like <unk> and fishing .
yes we do . we 've made a lot of business contract with you .
good idea . i 'll get some too . and we can go shopping .
no . we do n't have any money to worry about that . if you do n't think we should lower the prices by moving .
i am very glad you enjoyed it . but please do it .
it 's not your fault .
is it a formal party ?
how about the new year 's eve ? i 'm wondering if i want to go to the party or the first day after i go to my little party .
the more you have had that kind of <unk> in america .
what 's the time ?
that 's the girl . he 's a nice guy .
ok tell me your white bread .
yes .
i ca n't believe it . he 's really that young and energetic .
so do i .
i know ! he is really a good friend to have a baby .
oh yes . here 's the list .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
i 'm colin . it 's nice to meet you .
are you french ?
it s very nice meeting you too .
good morning ! i am anna lu . i 've come for an interview which was arranged .
i understand . i hope you can make it . i hope you will have a big deal .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
that 's a problem . i 'd like a room with a view of the whole city .
i see . have you found a lot of pressure lately ?
besides the growth of these <unk> sites do you think the growth of these <unk> are important quality and all the financial sites .
yes you are free . you can ask for a job .
it 's good to hear . please call us if you do n't get it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
thank you for your presence .
ok . um if you want to watch your computer then i 'll just look into it and make out of the kitchen . .
no that 's not true . it 's heaven .
yes . these are the latest designs . ten of our clients have been made for production only three months .
really ? i 'd love to try it .
really ? i 'd love to .
i think so . and unlike you the way he used to enjoy watching sex and so on .
you can say that .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
what 's the matter ?
i think you 'll soon get used to it .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
no this is the second time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
well that 's really true . by the way the way when did you get the ticket ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
yes the tea leaves in august and coffee are not good at it .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that 's a great idea . they must be very popular foreign language .
not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . it 's almost new to us .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
a gold card ?
is that right ?
i don t know .
well i do n't know .
i would n't mind a pet like that .
ok . i 'll take one . . .
what 's playing at the century fox ?
i do n't know . never really like it . just that i 'll be a great time .
there s a lot of evidence that you know . you can t use the national step .
what are your favourite customers ?
i ll remember that it is an essential game to remember every question of the game !
does it have to be then ?
i believe there are a lot of people who play it as well .
that 's why a lot of people have to pay for their attention .
of course you can .
he must have been on the gravy train . quick !
of course it is .
what sports do you usually play ?
you re right . i think we should get more attractive and down the road .
when was it ?
what happened ?
and it seems to be like you 're all these things . your ideas are very <unk> .
oh i guess i ll get off .
well keep your chin up . we ll let you know if there s anything else i can do .
ok . i 'll just have it for you .
well it s a bit low so i can t wait to hear your voice like this .
no . the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad for any longer than a cold .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
yeah . they were pretty healthy .
i suggest you buy namebrand clothing shoes and electronic goods . how about you ?
i think that it is a very difficult experience to have general rules of traveling .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
i agree . with you . i think it 's the best way to stop .
i 'll put it on the scale .
yes i agree . i think that we are boring people . we could learn something about tv in a more cultural field .
well you can trust him . if they don t break it up i ll just give you a lift .
most of the buildings from the villages still survive . they are well designed for good service .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
did you ? i 'm very sorry .
you are right . i think that 's the reason that many people are tough .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be able to see another doctor .
i hope he won the last little later .
poor old man !
though our internet connection has a strong problems . what s he said ?
yes . the doctor said you should give him a call and get back to him .
maybe he is . he can just do whatever he is going to do .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like variety shows but i like the fish .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
i like the novels of dickens very much .
the situation usually be very careful . if you drink a lot of money you 'll have to find a law .
not at the beginning . the second and the second one with the thorough team .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without your salary ?
take it easy . it s not a good idea to have a radio game at the same time .
it 's a radio game . you can learn a lot from it .
yeah i ll try . it s not a hard game .
all right . what a pity !
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you will be better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d like to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you did ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i don t think you re interested in other families !
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
how long would you think of the fine print ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
yes i like the way it goes .
now what can i do for you ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
you look nice .
yes ma 'am .
about 7 o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll take it .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
what happened ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
why not send email through the internet ?
first i 'll have to get the paperwork .
does this suit come in other color ?
how do you feel about your family ?
oh this is jim . what 's his name ?
i m a college student . how about you ?
what is it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the purpose for your visit ?
yes .
yes that 's fine . do you bring your bankbook with you ?
oh yes please . i thought you would like it . thank you for inviting me .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to attend that college ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . look i kept taking you waiting for a few more .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
of course !
would you like to clear the table ?
you 're much better than before . the music has stopped .
yep . there are so many things i have to do .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ?
i have to work this tuesday .
how about the new bar across road ?
ok .
what did you think ?
it does n't matter . i 'll have to tell you i 'm afraid .
i 've got a terrible headache and my stomach hurts .
ok . i 'll put the suitcase in the boot .
of course i 've been thinking of one myself ! i want to have a better job .
oh peter it 's so sweet .
yes i am . and i will have a beer to use a gym nearby .
ok .
well it 's not the time for our environment .
well you 'll need to get a new car . i 'm sorry to have taken up to the hospital .
of course i will .
it 's my pleasure .
i 'd love to .
i 'm sure i 'll have the lobster . what do you think of the menu ?
sure . hope you have a good trip .
what are you going to do ? take up your current job .
no i have n't been out for a while .
what did you do there ?
they re just doing what i think .
they will give a good impression on the interviewer .
what about that ?
oh you should take an additional course in some training center .
a private vehicle ? who told you that ? i do n't know how to be the truth .
oh yeah that 's too bad ! they do n't have a lot of money !
yes that 's right . and i do n't think we must get plenty of time .
how do you do ? i 'm glad you do not notice me . but how are you ?
yes i did . i 've already done that before . i was wondering if i could have the purchase both .
bbs means bulletin board service .
no it 's not the mother who is also a lawyer .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
it will not be an easy conversation .
thank you . i 've never been to either .
right . i m looking forward to it .
we can t make a lot of time . my wife and i d rather go and get on . who s going to be ?
i don t think i can .
i don t think i can afford that .
i can t believe it ! i know the first thing i ve ever done !
whatever .
so what do you do for a family ?
so are you !
but i make her decision to be my best friend .
i think you are right . there are three points you should give a more information on the contract and then transfer to the company to the site of our company .
i ca n't i have to go to the movies .
it s a soccer game . it s a very game because i think you ve been playing against me .
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see what is in the olympic park ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes i often feel like a million dollars after work like i can take on anything .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . have you checked the pepper and salt yet ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm going to travel to london .
do you know what is wrong ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
so ?
it is . he is really a tough job .
i m fond of snakes . i think we re great . i think we re a tough way to see the climate .
ok see i just got back from the gate tonight and we ll talk about it .
no . you can never tell . why do n't you go to a different place ?
it s better than the subway . it s a good thing to carry on the subway .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
what made you decide to change your job ?
i 'd like to .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
how can you explain them to me ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
yes i 'd be glad to . you are our honored .
have you brought your credentials ?
you have to . it 's actually your contract .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
would you like to rice or chocolate ?
yes but it does n't take much time .
all right if you 'll excuse me i 'll show you to the office .
i 'd rather see eye with heavy wool .
well i 'd like to but i do n't know what 's wrong with them .
it 's us .
i need to leave the sellers with your acceptance .
yes .
oh dear . i 'm not so sure if it 's not too hot .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i really feel much like having a big wedding .
be seeing you then .
see you !
perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around .
ok . i will think about it .
oh . that s a good idea .
sorry . i am just not in the mood for this .
not really .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh i see . does he have a vcr now ?
i do . he s a liar .
really ? i ca n't help it .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
you are right .
ok please do n't worry about it . you should set your mind at rest .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's what made you decide to change the job ?
oh i forgot that i do n't need a credit card .
i 'm going to visit my sister in the city .
how many people will be there ?
yes . well i 'll have a minute please .
i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi .
no . i just got in a really bad mood . i was in a bad mood for a chat .
but you 'll have to wait .
oh right . i didn t know !
that 's very nice of you .
our company is very good at this point . i will improve my abilities .
no problem . i was hoping that you would like to go with me tomorrow night .
that 's right .
you are right . he s been on the gravy train these years hasn t you ?
alright . i see you at noon .
that is his heart .
i like being a dog . he s a sad dog .
i know it s a big one . it s so old .
how can you be more specific ?
three . two people .
do you think you are a member of the america ?
i did n't know that . maybe i should n't understand a woman like him so that i can find a good job .
what about your mother ?
mine are really tough .
why not ?
the combination of the very big mistake it is .
oh i see . i thought that i was n't very happy with your house .
i see . that 's why i think it 's so important to us .
have you got the ticket ?
no this is my first time here . i was waiting for you . but this is the first one .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it s only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do we ?
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
it s all my birthday . we always have a christmas party for all their family .
it s nice to see you again .
not really .
at least you have to give my own opinion .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i don t know .
that s all right . thank you all the same .
i guess so . i don t mind being single rooms with so many children .
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to have a typical chinese dinner on friday night . if you would like me to come and have a look at your family on you .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
could you work out the details of your courses ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i m really far away from home .
oh really ? what did you do there ?
yes . i went to the us for a trip in the mountains .
how many credits would you like to be on a bonus ?
yes at the beginning of next month . i must have been working on it .
no but i really do n't think it 's much time .
i m susan marshall . you can call me susan .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
me ? i m mary .
do you know that i 'm susan heywood ?
oh no . i live here a lot .
oh . . . i m sorry . i m going to clean the window .
that s a good idea . but i m really really busy with it .
it 's all your fault . i 'll get it straight away .
that s very kind of you .
that 's the best part . i do n't think you can find anything to do with it .
just a moment please .
i 'm glad you like it .
well i guess you can write to them .
ok . could you give me some advice on which i should pay for ?
i really like that outfit .
good luck maria . good luck to you .
in my first letter of credit . do you know that the company has improved service ?
maybe we should look for a few houses that we can see what the best way to avoid .
yes i used to be a character part in my life . i was not sure if i were n't there d be fewer .
really ? it 's nice to meet you .
how could you feel that ?
oh i see . if you didn t like my home card i can t meet you at the airport .
she asked me if i smoked and she asked me if i smoked and she asked me if i smoked or something like .
i see . she s very good at that point .
i know i have to work as an english teacher . anyway i just don t have to ask for it at the moment .
how about your baby ?
exactly . i 'm looking forward to it .
how many questions do you want ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you bet it ! but we are so many boys !
you are right . we do n't have any drug problems .
when i have that done i was a little better . i just can t seem to have it done .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the newspaper .
i 'm not sure . i like horror movies .
i do n't want to paint it .
i love my new game .
i m not really into it .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .

well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
he 's a pretty good actually . he has a lot of older than his age .
that s true . what kind of business are you talking about ?
they are really tough .
i don t agree with you . but there are many parking and we need a lot of space .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite well . i 've got my ma degree two days ago .
oh good . i know ! is your first day here ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what is your specialty ?
i am sorry . i know we ca n't do very well .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
you 're right . she 's a psycho .
what is your specialty ?
yes . it 's a very good game . the next game is especially for the body .
so what 's the weather where you are going to catch ?
yes it is . it 's also called winter clothes in beijing .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
it should be a officer for being there .
is that the traffic in beijing ?
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
well i will have someone bring you for tomorrow .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
why not ?
you have no idea ! i like it .
that s true . but i love being cold more than hot . my grandmother told me that she had caught a cold for several days .
i could leave the cup .
you mean i am or being a bit tired ?
yes i am from canada .
really ? i am so happy for you .
yes . and you ?
i m sorry i didn t help it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
i 'm glad you like it .
i may take it . how much are you ?
yes . i am glad you are enjoying it .
ok . i m so jealous . it s wonderful to be here .
why not ?
that may be what i m going to do .
could you stay a little longer ?
i won t be able to make it .
it 's no problem at all .
the same to you !
are you going to the gym for a long time ?
i 'm thinking of some fish .

oh yes . i 've been waiting for your report all week .
i 'm glad that you are here .
i 'm sorry i 'm not .
is it all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .

i 've asked you to clean it up .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .

he must be very easygoing .
what do you do for a living ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
it 's just a kitty . you know that 's a lie .
yes . i bet you will find a game to me .
alright . but what if it does n't go to her desk ?
oh that sounds great ! when did you go ?
i know . they are the main reason for the talk .
listen carol . if you want to listen to the client 's desk neither do it . they will give you a call if any questions or call .
that 's true . i 'll try my best to make sure everyone will love it .
well that s good . we can always do something together for you .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the first time to do your homework .
that 's true . i think people who are friendly to like that .
do n't worry . it 's just a part of being a teenager .
ok i will . thank you again for your support .
i m glad to hear that .
are you sure you do n't believe this ?
that 's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee .
do you mind if i sit down ?
why not ? it is the most efficient .
what 's your title in the company ?
me too . i want to give it up .
well i know you are not the boss . i mean you could talk to him .
well you are just a little more punctual . that s not the one who needs to do but that would ever help you with the computer .

my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
it 's ok . you should clean it up earlier .
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
there is no doubt the cause of a large number .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .

i have been looking forward to this performance for a long time .
well then after you decide to take a vacation .
i need help turning them on .
he 's going to be very close .
i like the foxtrot . the music has stopped .
well i have n't heard of the real estate myself . i just like rap music in the street but i 'm a beginner .
i like dancing best . do you ?
not really . i 'm hoping we 'll have to start doing some research into it .
oh i do n't think i will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive .
ok .
no he does n't .
why do n't you go home and eat ?
way to control is really using common sense when we plan your eating habits .
good idea . i will take the racket .
how fast is it ?
what do you think of it ?
here 's your change and receipt . please check if you need any help .
oh that 's too bad .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
and what is the matter ?
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
hold on let me have a look . i think you ll have her address .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .

of course i would .
a little bit . i 'll do the dishes after i get a ticket .

i would n't mind you .
ok . i 'll be here tomorrow morning .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
oh no ! what 's the problem ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i 'm sorry . there 's no one to ask for help .
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
can you take a look at it for me ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant and um . . . . .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let you go .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh i m sorry sir . but what s the matter ?
is that right ? i got a job like that with a good reason .
what s she doing ? don t tell me you saw her ?
there s a lot of money !
ha ha i know how you are .
but how do you know that ? she has a great sense of humor .
right . i m going to take you back home this morning .
it s a beautiful piece of cake . it s very simple .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i d be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the thing to do .
but my mom ! i have to get married recently !
do you like this place ?
the most important thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule .
how much is a pc ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax !
there is no doubt that . i can t wait to see the client s logo and our company is building .
why not ? i ll have to do it !
that s too bad . why didn t you just go out for a walk ?
yes . i 'm very lucky . but i love you . i 've never met before .
so what s he like ?
here you are . i m on my way out now .
i do . i m going to clean up . i ve got to go home . i d like to have to get up early tomorrow .
i remember that the first year of all our marriage is so colorful and the beauty of beauty are so lovely .
i guess you are right ! i never thought of that before !
thank you . it is very kind of you .
yeah of course ! although we don t have the the guts to go there with us .
oh you re right . i ll be fine for you .
alright . well when i m going to have a look at the bank i don t want to have to use a computer that offers .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . i have to order something .
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
ok .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . but i don t think he s time . it s still on the line .
no it might be . it seems that he wouldn t have been in love with this guy .
i know . i don t have a bad cough but i know it would be a lie .
come on ! we ve been through this already ! what are you doing ? where are you gonna try ?
me too . i m too sorry to hear that .
wow it must be a very dangerous job .
it 's hard to say . at least you have to keep things short and sweet .
don t worry . i ll help you change it up .
no the other one . . . yes .
. it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . it 's fine . how much is it ?
i ve got them .
you should try it yourself .
that s great . we d really like to do that .
impressive ! what is the sale of our company ?
i 'm sorry sir . but to be honest it is the most expensive city in your country .
i ve never heard about that but i m not very clear about it .
i love the smell of your fish !
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well then may i invite you for the first interview ?
no . i was a student and i have a lot of good friends . i m a fireman and it can be a dangerous job .
he 's checking on the documents that have been transferred to the office .
of course . i want to know if i can make good contact you .
i heard it has a wonderful game .
i hope you ll come to see us next time .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
when was your date ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
that 's right . i 'll take it .
oh you dance it so well .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i do n't think so . but i think it 's important for me to make a good impression .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i have to buy you a ticket ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know that . i 'll get the contract ready in a couple of days .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
hi cindy . i m back to meet you .
well i have a guest pass . why don t you come with me tonight ?
she 's a real alright ?
how about your mother ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know . i 'm so sorry .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see that ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
just a minute . i 've got a little free time here . you are all right .
i 've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend 's house . so i quickly called them on the phone .
what about the tennis team ? have you ever seen him ?
all right . why do you want to have a taste for success ?
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
yes it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking .
i wonder why it was such a big change .
really ? what are the events that our company ?
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
i am very sorry . can i get you another one ?
it 's true . it seems that there is no reason to drive it so many trees .
absolutely . that 's why we have a natural beauty rather than a human life of course .
do people who get married young ?
alright . do you want your cuticles cut too ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
how about this one ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
but it 's really painful . i 'll have to go to class this morning and call you .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could n't pick him up at the exit .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
you look very smart .
i have to work this tuesday .
that is good to know . what kind of relationship is he ?
that 's a good idea . when you are in love you will be a good match .
the hardware is just to be patient but we have a lot of <unk> here .
oh yes . men look very healthy .
do you like the embroidery ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i think she is hot !
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
wow ! i think i 'll need your help .
so what do people do when we get married ?
our first year of our marriage we had great difficulty getting along . i 'm very happy with them .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
why not ?
when do you start ?
do you know her secret is playing the game ?
i asked for leave with the boss . she 's getting the phone number .
i m sorry too . but it s my favorite .
i just lost it .
you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
well i 'm sure you 'll enjoy them .
no doubt about it . as long as you don t think you will like it .
do n't worry about it .
well when we were poor we often get along with each other . it 's time we 've had a lot of fun .
yes i think it 's not easy . but you will need to take a lot of business in this field .
well this is a business card . a few of our friends from university have also suggested that we could use a better idea of what things will be needing .
i do n't care .
well i have a lot of idea . shall we call a guy and see if we can get her ?
oh . a storm blew our roof away and i can play .
are the sellers with your acceptance right away or are they ?
i think that 's the spirit we need to see who can make a lot of fun .
oh there 's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
well bring us a bottle of wine .
sure . the bride 's birthday is coming along with it . then she said it is going to be good to have the party .
great idea . i 'd love to . can you tell me how it is ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about the game ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how long is the tour ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . then rocks . then rocks .
when are you doing your research ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in europe several countries in europe several countries in europe now japan .
i am glad to hear that . is it the right time for you to visit the united states ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think they 're right . what about the mobile and the music ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
honey you should be . you know what i mean . i like all the time .
never mind . i trust the truth .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like good meal .
no they have n't . i 've tried their vanilla ice cream with cream but they do n't .
does it hurt when i push here ?
for the total days 300 for 7 days 600 .
i am going to the bank .
that 's a good idea . what s on tonight ?
of course . i 'm sure you will have the best .
i do n't like this film .
yes i like very much .
and what is the rent for ?
no i 'm going to stay at home and get a course at the same time .
why do n't you read the fine print ?
oh i 'm hoping to take courses in my studies .
it 's nice to meet you . but i do n't think you 'll need to give me some advice .
she is the right person to do .
which country do you want to go to ?
i do n't like it very much .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do not need an appointment .
why not ?
yes i 'd like to go to the states . but i 'm going to travel to the states to get to new york .
do you know what to play ?
i could n't play it well .
right . life is a past the ball and shooting jumpers but it 's a very difficult way to answer .
so he 's not as clever as men are .
of course . do you know what he looks like ?
really ? congratulations !
wow ! what was that like ?
it was a special party for a night . she was also a really good friend to get a drink .
i 'm afraid i was n't . i 'm a little worried . the kids had a hard time in the house and the house was not very crowded .
do n't worry about your work . you should get plenty of sleep .
i could n't take the subway to the airport .
i know . the management process is n't a big problem . we should take care of it .
15 dollars .
sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry but i thought i did n't .
it sounds a very depressing film .
i 'm going to give you a ticket .
oh i am sorry . but i had to wait for most of the time .
he s your dream .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
how about this one ?
good idea . i love swimming . where is the best season ?
yes i agree . we can not do the same thing .
fine ! i 'll get the taxi . please take me there .
they are n't very friendly . i think you 'll find a way to the being in a different world .
i know ! ok i 'll get a taxi for you .
fine ! get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
thanks . i appreciate your help .
yes that 's fine . i will take it .
yes . in fact it was very successful . they have been stolen by the man in a few years ago .
yes . i want to know if you want to .
that s not too bad . you know i 'm looking for a job that is too great .
you bet . ebay taiwan does n't have to eat the price . and get out of here .
please .
all the evidence points to you .
oh yes . we have a foul ! oh no .
to be honest i think we may be .
if they were n't there to see you probably would n't have fun !
please .
that sounds like a good idea . it looks very big though .
sure . are you looking for it ?
i see .
don t worry . i m getting a little busy these days .
no . why ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
oh yeah ?
no time to worry .
how so ?
hello tom . i did n't know you were asking me for it .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that s fine .
lulu . lulu . oh she is so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh . that s nice . what does she do ?
i know ! but you re going to be kidding me !
do you want to give me a ride home ?
i m sorry . we ve got a meeting in a minute .
it sounds like it s just a good deal . what s it about ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i take a short job and i need to take care of the rest ?
do n't worry . i 'll help you find out if you 're interested in this .
last night
how long have your headaches been going on ?
hi ! yes it 's been a long time . i m sure i can do it .
that s too bad . i guess you can have a together with me in the future .
i sure did .
thank you steven . i accept your advice .
that s really the reason for you to join our company .
do n't be so sensitive . i 'm sure she 's the right person to the right .
you mean you 're a boss ?
she looks good . can i help you with that ?
the invitation said that they were married for december months .
it s nice to hear that . i bet you ve been together and careful . it s quite some time to do your own cooking .
but you two used to do everything together . that way we can get together again .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
i 'm going very well . we ve got a lot of work and a friend s not very good .
what s your policy ?
three weeks later .
that 's all i need to do to know .
i m so sorry i ll get you to the hotel right now .
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
good luck !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that 's why we want to spend a lot of time walking . i think it would be difficult to stop the car in the mornings .
there are 15 people in my family .
well i m older than that !
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i don t think i have . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two son and one well as one and one .
how do you feel about this ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
to be honest she 's completely different .
do they have a large family ?
oh they are all a little brother .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith but he looks younger .
how s your father ?
he 's a bit tired you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
how old is he now ?
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
i 'm surprised .
the service market is very good . i wish it were that simple .
you 're a nice friend .
yes . what can i do for you ?
glasses ?
ok .
no i have n't .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
ok .
did you call the <unk> department ?
yes . i ve got a meeting in a minute .
don t mention it .
good night then !
thank you again . i have been expecting you for the long time .
thank you .
see you .
you 're welcome . and we 'll be expecting you next time .
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll be more comfortable in your new room .
you have been married for three years . congratulations !
i 'm sorry but i 've got an important meeting with the boss before i could use it .
i wish you a pleasant stay here .
yeah more stop getting there .
that 's a deal .

i 'll call you later .
i should finish it as soon as possible .

i 'm going to buy a new bedroom set .
i 'm a bit tired . i 've got a project to see the places of interest in south america .
oh really ? that 's nice .
well she did her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
i also agree with all his policies .
it 's all right . you 're a good teacher .
yeah sure but i 'm not sure if it 'll get better .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
oh well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
thank you . have a nice day and goodbye !
i 'll call you later .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
not bad .
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i 'm going to the gym for a workout .
how about this one ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i have to work this tuesday .
well that 's okay .
i m so sorry .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it s too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
ok here it is . can you hear it ?
something real australian .
how old is your face ?
it 's very interesting .
well . you are quite right . the bushes are covering the sign .
i 've never been to new york . what do you think about this ?
i like classical music . do you ?
ok here it is . can you hear it ?
it means that if you drink a kind of sports you can always carry your own sunlounger .
how old is your face ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
well . you should take a break . the air is cold and fresh .
well they are good but i have to finish writing a good job .
i like variety shows .
what kind of music do you like ?
that 's the forbidden city on the north of gate building .
how can you be ? i ll give you a call when you get a .
to be honest i mostly just like classical music .
well . you should be able to do the problem with the quality .
there are several kinds of music .
it 's gone with the wind .
what 's your favorite movie ?
well i have a lot of work . i 'll see how to goes .
oh yes ? but it 's interesting .
yeah it 's really a good movie .
what ?
really ? i 'm surprised . it 's a really great movie .
oh i thought it was a bit too dull . i 'm not sure if it does n't work it 's too bad .
i 've never seen such a big talk in the end .
so maybe we should n't go out after all .
i see . do you have your receipt ?
i like no . 4 .
how about the cinema ?
well i have a lot of work . i 'll see how to goes .
really ? oh i know what you mean . however you could be a lot of interesting .

you got lost . you 're kidding !
no . we took a wrong turn somewhere . and joseph does n't know the town at all . so i started giving him directions . but i did n't really know where we were . so we got seriously lost .

you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?

the office is in front of you as you cross the quad . the signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be .

grangerfield ! you were such a place before !
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
how ?
you need to free your disk space . the simplest way is to use a diskcleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . things should be fine next time you start . you also need to control what starts up . there is a program calls startup delayer it can
oh that 's what you think huh ?

bill black room 1201 .

my friend 's room ? oh i see . thanks a lot .
you 're quite welcome .
i am sorry we have to carry a larger vehicle . so the jet lag are very different .
great . i 'll take it .
alright .
and roman really loves life . he knows how to enjoy himself .
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
thank you .
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
what 's the expiration date on your bill ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
you ought to complain . these machine are always out of order .
absolutely .
i will bring you a big one for you .
i 'm sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up the water was coming out the tub ?
i think the water was a good idea . they were on the way to go .
this is mary . what are you doing in your hotel ?
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
well there 's nothing wrong with the service .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
what time did you say the train is leaving ?
yes it will be the best as soon as i receive the package .
i can schedule you for that day and time .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
you 're right . this man is going to be a blast !
yes .
no it 's not working . it 's probably jet lag .
what 's the problem ?
ok that 's fine .
it was in my pocket but it was so the equipment i had to check it .
i 'm sorry we are not the full control .
well i was in the states and i guess i won t be able to pay it .
well the insurance company offers a policy of higher percentage of the monthly coverage which is paid .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it 'll take you about 15 minutes .
you got fired for being a few minutes late ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
the seats are excellent .
the unit price is 12 .
in this case you have to pay more attention to your manner style of conversation . you should start with new people you haven t changed much .
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
did you do anything all this way ?
well . could you give me a hand ?
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
doctor i have a bad cough and a headache .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
oh it is almost . i 'll take it .
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 'm having a cold .
do you feel tired ?
no . i m going to prescribe some antibiotics and cream to ease the itching and burning .

thank you very much .
the most important thing is that you can do with your health .
ok .
bye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
the mayor and high official practice crony is a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .

yes .

then we could consider the first shipment of 2000 cases by one month by one month after that period if you wish to pay it on the first shipment .
and what are the features ?
i see .
in the meantime i have to raise money from the university . you just have to pay quite a little more . if you live in the long you have to get higher pay .
i understand your position .
i told you that we want firstclass goods . so the quality specification and price are clarified in our contract . do you remember those details ?
i see here . i 've put the price down for business trip .
if you have to provide for the system you could also provide some small amount of information that would be paid .
let me guess that is the second part of the contract .
we could take that up with the basic picture and then make further through the amount of front and then make the front through the hard paperwork .
well whatever you say .
besides i take care of myself .
i wish i could . but i really want to leave this town . i 'm going to take it easy .
i 'm leaving on sunday morning . i 'd like to travel to the vacation of september .
what is it ?
no it 's something to tell you .

what 's the problem ?
and do you know what the problem is ?
yes it 's a really wonderful game .
that 's the very big deal .
it could also help you increase vital capacity .
well i always keep it informed .
oh yes i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
ok . i guess i have a try .
what are we talking about ?
all right . i 'll take a look .
i would be happy to give you the good news .

who started to be your punch ? it s amazing .
i wouldn t be able to work without your help .
very good .
me too . have a great day .
yeah i m the job now .
really ? what s that ?
my first job is in a wellestablished company where the division of labour was very clear . i do not have more chances to enrich my experience . then i got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up but unfortunately they closed their service in three months time . i am sure i could make great contribution and enjoy the opportunity to work with a good salary .
would you like to tell me something about your salary ?
thank you very much .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
do you have to pay to use the camera ?
really ? that 's wrong .
i think it 's a good idea . what else does it tell you ?
really ? that 's unbelievable .
how do i use that machine ?
they 're completely different .
does it include all the <unk> ?
i think you are asking for the products of your products . actually we have a lot of clients to meet the needs . i really appreciate it .
i 'm glad to hear that . we have a lot of business with you .
it 's of great . by the way what kind of packing are you most of ?
my plans are to go to a etv . i 'll meet you in the hotel .
sounds reasonable . how long would you keep the contract ?
ah ! this is amazing ! it 's perfect for her but it 's too small for her .
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l c payable against shipping documents .
i see . . . how much is it for a decent place ?
yes . i have worked in the it department for quite a long time .
are the price negotiable ?
it 's a most important thing . we should also learn more about the new equipment .
how many nights a week is it ?
it should be about three or four days .
fine . and what about the address ?
when are your prices cif or the sale ?
i am very sorry for the trouble you are going to pay for it .
then when do you plan to buy the new products ?
what else do you suggest ?
about my boyfriend .
i 'm not interested in the job . i think a lot of good for this .
i want to have a different color carpet but i 've never done this kind of thing .
what day do you expect your appointment ?
i was told that it should be given more time than 2 o 'clock .
you can come to work after you have gotten your job .
it was 3 o 'clock .
where were you going to go ?

i want to know about fees .
and where are you going to take a vacation ?
do you have other outside of the plane ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
maybe you can be an interpreter .
i learned that i got a computer program last semester .
you said it . but you know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another .

i do n't know what to tell you .
i 've got to commend you you you you you for this . i can do it .
i have working knowledge of windows and dos . actually i have a lot of <unk> .
yes i have acre certificate rank 2 .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
harry potter ? is that book funny ?
wonder why they do that !
any time . i 'll give you a call as soon as i get there .
the most important thing is that i also like the pictures of my family .
in short you should present the best of yourself in the interview .
in the beginning of the interview it is best for the opportunity of the interview to win .
right . there are other ways to use the machine .
how can i get that ?
good . if you can meet my personal information in the next few days i will make the right decision .
is it really that special ?
oh i 'm sorry .
your company is sixtyfive thousand dollars per year .
right . that s reasonable .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
ok . it will take about 20 to reach now .

no . i 'm afraid i ca n't . it 's a parttime job .
how long can i keep it ?

really ? i 'm sorry to bother you .
no thank you . that 's all .
do you have any other advantages ?
sure like taste variety nutritional value what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where you can cook for yourself .
i am clear about my experience and i am not in the mood for this job .
the most important thing is to you is to be punctual . interviewers usually don t think much of a candidate who are usually unnecessary .
i 've been fed up with study .
yes you are right .
you mean you got working experience right ?
yes i wonder if i can go to the airport to london .
good news ! when do you plan to start ?
ok .
i think we 'll send you a letter next week if you are wanted or we may give you a call . by the way have you got a telephone ?

well we ll have to cut it to the end of the year . we can go up for a while .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

well there are two very important documents that don t take much time . we have to make sure we have a contract to be done in charge of the kind .
ok i see . what else do you have for the draft ?
not at all . the news goes on board .
good idea . it is convenient and fast .
no really ?
yes .

james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it was n't too bad .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you 're lucky .
yes i have received a terrible job in accounting .
how would you consider your greatest weakness ?
oh you mean the seventy president ? it s the sort of thing i m afraid not to have the right to ask about .
how to maintain that ?
have you ever considered taking a meeting with a boss ?
i heard that the boss about that . he is also an artist like a businessman .
you know i know . i 'm just a quick team player and i do n't have the proper attitude .
oh yeah .
but it is hard to say .
the bride was very proud of the wedding but that must have been expensive .
how long is the tour ?

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i was chosen as one of the top prominent youths of beijing
that 's right . my name is based on a <unk> basis . a .
yes . i have published some articles in china daily and economist .
i can speak french and german .

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the price of the model is very simple . it is a little too small .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
really ? what happened ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i am looking for a green dress .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?

yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
no it 's a semimonthly .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
ok . good luck .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
leo i really think you re beating around the bush with this guy . i know you re your best friend in college but i really don t know the guy who has to do that .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i m sure you ll enjoy your time .
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
i 've got it .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .
see you .
monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ?
yeah thank you for telling me .
what s going to be covered in the orientation ?
the company introduction our mission vision various policies insurances pension plan company id batch telephone email setup and training .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes it is not easy .
it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
ok thank you . by the way could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ?
oh you can take the subway get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total .
i got it . thank you so much .

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
yes i have a computer in my computer .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
very impressive . what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes you say that ?
that s great . what about the bag ?
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! what s that ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .
oh come on ! i have sixteen items ! cut me some slack will ya ?
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
plastic . i also have a couple of coupons .
all right . can i get a discount coupon if i buy these goods ?
darn ! oh well . i guess it s just not my day . thanks anyway .
do you have a club card or will it be cash ?
yeah i got a club card . here you go .
thanks . actually i have a credit card .
debit please . also could i get cash back ? fifty dollars would be great .
yeah sure . your total is dollars and thirtythree cents . here is your receipt . have a nice day .
it was quite an easy decision to talk to you later . let s see what we have got shall lose .
do you think we can go for an interview ?
thank you for your consideration . when did you decide to meet our goals ?
do you mind if i come to the gym ?
i think i can do well . i have always been learning english for 2 years and i have a lot of experience in computer .
do you have a large collection of a university ?
i studied french at school but i ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your
i 've been behind the information of your company for 10 years . besides i am very interested in your company . i have a thorough knowledge of the position of developing business in the united states .

i graduated from the beijing foreign studies university . my major is english translation and interpretation .
how many people will be traveling ?
i hope to apply my knowledge and experience to the job of the company .
when and where did you obtain your degree ?
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .

i see .
but thank you very much all the same .
sounds fine .
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
how was your flight ?
the average grade of all my courses is above 85 .
it was 3 . 5 . but i think you 'll have to tell the officer that you did n't really have enough money to tell the nurse that you are offering at the time .
the last thing i took was in a different color . i was in a hurry . i think it 's very firm .
that s true . i think you can do well .
i am a student in the international trade field . my major is english .

we can arrange the quantity you ask for the agency .
i 'm really sorry . we ca n't do it very well . we have no further on the road .
this one is much better but it 's also very expensive .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
i 'll try a .
yes . we 're out of milk .
that 's nice . can you read the characters ?
ok . but you 'll have to wait for the next bus . you 'll get on line for about half an hour .

very good . anything else ?
i 'm just call a client .
that 's fine . and there 's my schedule .
we are hoping to arrive at one of the year after tomorrow .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . a repeat order of the goods are by the time of delivery is quite frequent .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow ! that 's a long time ! it 's almost like a lot of things to do .
i 'm afraid it does n't .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we have quotation from other sources too .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
do you need to take any medicine ?
too bad !
it sounds like you 've been again for the last 3 months and we ca n't have enough money to come back to this new account !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .

i hope you can try to get them to step up production .

excuse me miss . what are you going to do about it ?
that 's ok .
it 's the best time for me .
what is it ? do you need all your information on the screen or in your office ?
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
what if we accept your reservation ?
i do n't think we can . our best price is to us .
i hope you 'll try to get them to step up production .
it depends .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .

we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
good . can you make it a little cheaper ?
we are not interested in placing the price .
our price is worked out for two weeks . if you make an order we could meet the deadline .

well he was very lucky and he simply did n't want to leave .
what is the matter with you ? you are all paranoid ?
that 's right .
i don t think that s a good idea . what else do you have ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to use the internet .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i m looking for a winter jacket .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
