this is a white tshirt and a pair of earrings . look at this <unk> had the same pan but it has a few scratches and i can t stand it .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't bear it .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll have a steak sandwich and a large fries .
i think you 'll like the soft sleeper then .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .

i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends .

it s on sale today .
well you can t be serious .
that s not enough .
that s the way to go .
would you like to go to any lower the price ?
i want to order the vegetables and you the meat .
i am afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . it won t be long .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what 's the secret then ? is it the favor of my new bicycle ?
actually i like chinese food .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . it s very easy . the food here is prepared is tasty and it is high .
yeah it 's so much fun . i will have a try .
about ten days .
what kind of soup do you like ?
i want a pair of black leather shoes .
an ordinary one will be fine . i think the suits you .

i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh i see . i 'll take it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you bet . that s the most important thing i can get really shopping here .
i think so . i ve got a very nice ride .
i think you ll find the right place . i can see why you have a look at it .
let me have a look . i 'm taking a look inside your units . would you like to see it ?
what a lovely dog !
it s very hot in the kitchen . let s go shopping .
well i like the balcony but the is on the same side of the house .
i 'll take it .

you can pick up a new carpet and come back for a few more .

thank you for your compliment . wo n't you try this fish with white sauce ? i 'm rather round of it .
it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know . this is a macintosh .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what do you know ?
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that 's a pity !
what 's the difference between the two ?

yes my name is ms . jones .
sure . it 's my pleasure .
yes .
ok please take some water . do you want to order some ?

i think this type gets dirty very easily and it 's a <unk> color .
you are very welcome . i 'll see you tomorrow .
not bad . you are right .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
no it 's easy .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
thanks for saying that . it was a kind of dry dish .
i see . well here 's the thing . is that all you need to do ?
thank you mom . i will take care of it .
do you want to know where i got mine ?
thanks for reminding me . i 'll try it .
yes we do .

i hope that the weather will last .
oh . i thought you said you wanted to work for us .
oh come on ! what are you getting ?
ok let 's go .
ok let 's go .

our company is very popular with ladies .
well i 'm not used to editing with my credit card .
ok let 's have a look at the kitchen .
i hope you can have a nice trip home .
ok let 's go .
i think that 's a good idea . i have to find a house that is better than mine .
yes it 's on our new one .
i know . it 's the time for the kids to find a place to relax .
i have a lot of work to do .
ok let 's go and ask for it .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually in the long run the afternoon there are many beautiful ways to go .
ok . let 's do it .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
you have n't had any exams yet .
i 'd like to try chinese food .
really ? i do n't think i 'm interested in some of my courses .
i am . what about you ?
well you 'd better go to the movies .
i like the soy sauce chicken .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
yes . i 've heard about it but i 've never had a parttime job in business .
do you like some soup ?
it 's my pleasure .
have you ever tried a chinese restaurant ?
mmmm . . . . it 's delicious .
really ? chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines such as cantonese food sichuan food sichuan food fujisan food etc . our restaurant is not very fast .
sure . if you want to ask me the way you want to find a suitable job .
i need to buy a new bedroom set .
yes i have . i need to get rid of this issue . i also need some coffee and this suit .
oh that s very kind of you . but can i get a pencil from the station ?
no you can only get a parttime job or a fulltime one .
rin ?
you re welcome .
yes . we have many colors to choose from . they are very smart .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
your salesman told me that the one with the highest interest rate .
well we are getting some shirts and some sunscreen tonight .
what time do you work ?
they are small and there are many small stores .
are they safe ?
yes go ahead . i ll get the the food ready right now .
i know but i like the fashion .
yes we do . it 's a good idea .
that 's a good idea . but you have to work too .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i figure it myself . i think the most important thing is that i should do is throw a little more .
i was n't born yesterday .
i 'm glad to hear that . now i would like to offer you a new style .
the total amount is <unk> .
what are your parents going to do ?
it 's a good idea .
i 'm looking for a black leather belt for my husband .
sure . do you have the receipt ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . where did you buy it ?
i do n't know . i never did well in the interview .
oh . go and try it on .
what 's the problem ?
i 'll take a dozen .
well i guess you ca n't have used the same thing .
ok . i will take it . please fill in this form .
what can i do for you ?
i 'm afraid not . i 'm in a hurry . i 'll check to see you tomorrow .
all right . let me take a look .
i 'm sorry mr . miller but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to accept any help .
here you are .
thank you .
ok .
i think you should n't have come here . it 's my treat .
sure go ahead .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
do i have any other choices ?
would you give me your home phone number ?
i do n't know .
oh have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
it 's not only that the world is becoming more and more expensive than your families .
i do n't know . i never went to the gym .
that s my little secret ! i asked you to bring home the picnic right away !
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
what else do you suggest ?
oh yeah it 's fine . let 's see how i 've got the sound .
but it 's true . your sister is a little young . she loves her kids .
yes i called . thank you for helping me today .
i like cooking very much .
absolutely ! i had no idea that i would n't eat anything else !
i usually go to the gym every day .
yeah you are right . i m going to throw myself down the dance floor . it s not easy to keep up the pot .
i used to shop a lot but now i have to spend more money on food i go somewhere .
that s a good idea . you should do some exercise . you might find something you like .
well i like to swim and on the radio .
i ve got all your vegetables covered with it . we ll have them deliver right away .
we usually go to the personnel market .
that 's terrific !
it 's a place where you can get your meat from the cafeteria .
yeah i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like the soy sauce chicken .
the first is to be your friendly and the music is the third time for you .
yeah that 's ok .
it 's no problem at all . you are always on the date .
sure . why do n't we have a bite at the coffee shop ?
well i 'd like some coffee .
thank you you you you . i think i could have some beers right now .
no you can keep an eye on your plan .
it 's still going to be a good choice .
no you do n't care about your eating habits . i think it 's fine . just a little more .
coffee is a very good idea .
they are pretty good . i 'll take it .
sounds like fun . i 'll have a try .
that would be great . actually i am really looking forward to having something light .
not really . what are you going to do ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight .
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy .
i 've never had a pizza for a while .
i see . i 'll have a try .
sure that 's my favorite . have you ever tried another one ?
i have a lot of options . i also need some more practice before i start to do some cooking .
i know but i 'm not ready to throw myself down the ground .
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok .
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
it 's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
how about the rice ?
ok . i 'll bring it .
white rice please .
yes you are right .
i m making a decision .
i 'm going to go to the bathroom .
i know but i 'm already hungry .
what are you going to cook ?
i 'd love to .
i think i will have the dish of vanilla ice cream .
ok . i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
i thought i 'd stay at home .
i 'm going to go and get a snack .
i 'll take you then .
i do n't know . maybe i can find a table that is closer to the waitress .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
i 'd like to have a coke .
ok . well we have many units . which one do you want ?
i do n't drink much .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i suppose i should .
i 'll have a glass of beer .
i like the fish .
i 'm glad you like it .
i do n't know what to order .
what do you eat ?
i like apple pie .
what do you want ?
what about these ? they are very fresh and exceptionally juicy .
do you know what kind of sport you like ?
what do you mean by them ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what are you doing now ?
yes and they are my wife 's birthday too .
do you know what kind of sport you like ?
are you ?
that 's a good idea . why do n't we go for a walk in the pool ?
how about going to english corner with me ?
i want to get a puppy for my son .
ok . well we have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you 're dehydrated . first let me feel your pulse .
i 'd better drink a hot day .
i have to work this tuesday .

i have n't decided yet .
do you want to get a large one ?

thank you .
i 'll pick you up at about nine o 'clock .
i enjoy cooking .
yes . i 'll have the texas chili burger .
fine . if you need a shampoo it will be a problem for you .

i 'm really sorry . i made a mistake . i 'll just go and get it all right .
it 's my pleasure . we have single rooms double rooms double rooms suites and luxury suites .
we 'd like to have some salmon .

i need to get a passport .

i have a headache .
well here 's your rib . do you sell it ?

coffee please .
i love this design ! the original color of my aunt is so beautiful .
yes here you are .
thank you .

it 's a little too expensive . do you have a color in mind ?
i have more bad news .
no it is . speaking . how can i help ?
hi . do you want to send this parcel with us ?
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
i have a suit that needs cleaning .
i 'm going to give you a little more information .
what 's the matter ?
i know . but you should have told me you were in love with him .
that s okay .
oh does it cost money ?
does it close at six thirty ?
i know . i 'm just waiting for someone else to take care of this .
what s the difference between the two and the price ?
i m going to start the christmas day . i ll be able to get all the things ready in the afternoon .
i 'll take the word for it .
i don t know . it looks like we have a very big cavity . i can t take it anymore .
well i have to admit that you will lose weight if you want to use this .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month .
well you don t have any cash so you don t have a new card .
fine . what shall i do for you ?
it s still very tired . we will take the train to get there early .
what ! how am i going to get to school or go shopping ?
just pick up some soft drinks and only a bottle of beer .
i was getting dressed in the morning . it s about six o 'clock .
that s great . you ve got a really good idea .
i see . how are things in this trip ?
you know that i care for you .
what 's wrong with it ?
yeah it 's really great .
yes . it s quite an excellent piece of work .
it s going to be so late .
do n't worry . you will find someone again .
thank you .
great ! this is a wait here . i can t wait to try to throw in the trash !
thanks a lot .
yes it does .
i am sorry . i know we have no choice but you must follow me .
i 've heard that but i do n't want to be late .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
i am just thinking of taking a vacation . you know i 'm going to quit a new job ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
do you have any other questions ?
no it 's just the sort of thing . i 'll have to ask about it .
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
and they are very fashionable you see .
geez . is there anything else ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . . i think my mom will definitely do that .
well i can t help you .
oh my gosh ! i can t wait ! my hair is not like you !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t worry ! i ll take care of it . and i know if i don t have it .
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's nice . how much is it ?
and this one ?
nah this is boring .
i think the government can afford a new car . the honda has made a lot of improvement in it .
i guess .
i am thinking of taking you back home .
i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
what about the rest of the hard work ?
sounds good . do you have any idea how to educate on your own ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
it 's nice .
merry christmas to you !
just a second . i 'll be right over .
you can just take it home and plug it into the machine .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
don t worry . i m sorry .
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and if you are .
fine . let s call a . i think we can work together .
what 's your hearing about ?
i can t believe that the weather is so boring . maybe i should go to the gym like i do n't want to be ripped like you .
have you ever had a cold ?
no i forgot to buy some .
did you buy anything else ?
you are so kind .
i guess you re right .
i know ! but it s so much fun .
i 'm just trying to complete today 's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .
i am sorry sir . i can t believe you had a .
i am not surprised . i think i 've got a cold .
i think you should buy a sweater for a few years and i m not sure how big it would be .
anyway i think that we need to buy a new sweater for a few months we can t use it .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you are the one who keeps you in the mood for the long time . i want to learn how to do this stuff .
you are more beautiful than your hair !
you are right on that point . i think i m going to put a whole face in my eyes .
yes .
i have to get up early tomorrow morning . i love you !
what are you doing ? why are you washing clothes all the time ?
ok here 's the thing . i don t like the color and all the back were <unk> .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach !
thanks honey ! you have such a great day . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
i thought you had been to the movies about a person . there s a special movie just the kitchen and you said it would be fun .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about . you re an type of guy i know i m gonna make you run a new guy in need of an eyebrow and mascara . then i need to get foundation
if you re not going to be angry with me i ll always be your friends .
i really love him .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
what ? you don t love me ? my friends ?
just kidding . i m just doing fine . . .
alright come here ! we have a barbecue !

well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of money ? i 'll have a try .
well first of all your salary can be high and high quality .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up some souvenirs !
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i know . but i am not a good swimmer . can you tell me what time it is ?
i understand . for the sake of us i 'm used to adults but my husband is on special projects . the most important thing is that i do n't think it 's about time for a while .
do you have a other outside of the world 's face ?
what 's up ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no . i thought it 'd be a good idea to see a movie .
i feel the same way .
you know that i am proud of you .
i 'm always at your service .
do you want to go by bus ?
thank you .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
i 'll take you to the train station .
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
i 'm looking for a bookcase but i 'd like to give up an hour for two kids .

well what if you think about it ?
it 's love at first sight .
you mean your boss ?
yes . i m a student and i have a guest ticket . you can have a money check too .
do you have any particular type of cold ones ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .

i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it .

i do n't believe they are so boring . i think that they sell them at the moment .
well . you may like to be beautiful too .
it s a very simple thing to be a face .
sorry . i 'm not really surprised .
no i have n't .
i 'm going to resign . the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i like spring best .
it 's almost impossible to get the right balance . i can teach you how to play the piano .
do you have any hobbies ?
what 's it like ?
how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
what about this one ? it 's the latest design .
it 's the least standard to go to the beach with a family reunion .
come on . we 've got to be here .
i will .
we landed in southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .
it s a very popular game . we play every weekend .

i m really surprised . there are many stories of people who speak chinese . you know i m a good student and i love the way .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's hard to say . but i do n't think my favorite movie is n't bad .

i feel quite down .
what 's the difference between these two ?
if you do n't know it 's a long problem .

the big ones are wonderful but i would like to have them bought for my wife and me one .
the first goal of the course !

i could have been in the kitchen and my wife is always living with it .
no you can learn a lot from it .
no . he 's so far away i can hardly see him !
i 'm sorry . you 're right . but we ca n't do that .
i do n't know . maybe it 's hard to say .
yeah . he is a hard worker . he is always taking a break from telling lies .
i was never . i had to get this cool guy last week .
yeah i agree . and it s really an automatic . people do n't live without them .
yeah you are right . people should learn to cut out more often .
is there anything else you 'd like to eat ?
i get it . i put it in foot and find it difficult to get the goods to be put off my hand .
i 'm sorry to hear that . would you mind telling me the a little bit about your present job ?
she 's pretty . she 's a teacher of aerobics .
i do n't know . maybe it 's just that i have n't seen the olympic games in the states .

it 's a shame .

i do n't know . maybe it 's better than my old one .
i went to the library and lost my bag .

how do i use the computer ?
that 's really cool . i 've got an idea . have you ever been there before ?
i 'm very glad to meet you mr . smith .
what 's the problem ?
no but i did n't notice that .
i had a similar experience when i had the idea .
have you fallen in love ?
that 's right .
i think it was a better idea .
i think that he had a litter too much of the punch .
i told him that i was speaking in a lineup .
it certainly is ! it 's been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
are you applying to study or work abroad ?
i hope so . thank you .
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .

yes . i am free tonight .
ok no problem . see you next monday .
see you .
sure . it 's a pleasure to say .
that is a beautiful day . what 's the occasion ?
why do n't you go to the church and come over and join them ?
so i 've heard of chinese people say that science is the most beautiful changes .
no it is n't .
it 's not good for me . it 's an apartment i 've never had a new apartment .

i have to work this tuesday .
oh good . that 's a good idea .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?

i 'm going to give you a ticket .
oh thank you . i 'm glad to meet you .
i like the colour and i will take it .
i hope so . thank you .
what a pity !
sure . it 's actually a festival in the southern part of the united states .
what 's the occasion ?
i will be getting my assistant look over it .
what 's the occasion ?
they are the usual ones .
ok . and what about the sports ones ?
yes you 're right . in fact there is a big difference between the people who are usually on the subject .
well it 's hard to say so . while it seems we are more younger than in my country .
i do n't know .
that 's great . we can get there in time .
i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock on the morning .
i 'm going to have to do the dishes .
i do n't see it .
the tv station is next to the east of the west .
no i ca n't agree with you . it 's a sports camera .
yeah .
cool ! and i want to know if i can play more relaxing in the future .

of course i will . so how 's the flight ?
do n't be so sad .
thank you . that s very kind of you .
well that 's the price . it 's a little expensive but it 's a little expensive .
it 's 150 yuan .
can you also get large carpet for me and i also want to buy one large bathroom .
yes it is . but you will need to come in to collect it for several days .
not really . at the moment i am starting to find a onebedroom apartment with four hundred and more than a half .
yes . i have a very good time .
it does n't sound like that . does it keep going with all the time ?
hey young man . it 's not funny .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
what kind of program would you like to be the best ?
do n't you know that ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
thanks . now what are we having ?
what are your plans and what are you interested in ?
thanks . i am proud of myself too .
it 's too bad .
well . . .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
i have a lot of work to do .
well . it s hard to say .
you should n't put it in this place .
never ?
yes .
i will .

but i love you more than we have had planned .
i 'm sorry but i 've got some money .
just a beer .
oh good . what time does the 759 get to london ?
i do n't know . maybe i can find my favorite stuff in the window .
i used to be able to come one of them .

i went to play tennis in the public park .

yes but i did n't .
it 's really very helpful .
i 'm glad you came .
you are welcome .

yes . we 've found a few of them in the past two years .
please be seated .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i like the foxtrot and the walls .
do n't be such a chicken . be honest ! i do n't think i 'm a good person .
yeah you 're right . swimming is a very good way to dance is important . wanna have a bite ?
that 's something i can see .
i wish that were a great goal !
yes . in fact the whole nation is the most effective .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
in order to prevent the fish from being covered with food and the fish is in the west .
i think that the most important thing is the nature of the job .
let 's see . . . we are in the back of the question .
well this is designed for exclude them from domestic market is n't it ?
it 's a good idea .
i like the writer 's language too .
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's a good idea . how about you ?

of course . but i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
i am sorry sir . i 'll bring you a receipt for you .
i agree . i 'll tell them .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices .
maybe you 're right . but i think you 'll be making a fuss . the stockholders are the final .

and to be honest i think it 's really a little crazy .
yes . oh the music has a nice view .
how about playing the game ?
do you know which one he would like ?
it 's very nice .
i wish i had n't come up here .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .

thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot right ?
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?

do you like the foxtrot ?
good .

i do n't think so . it 's a sheer waste of time .
what kind of visuals should i use ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i 'm very sorry . i 'll bring you a new one tomorrow .
that s fine .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
it 's mild . but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
i do n't know how much this weather can last .
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics

i 'm glad to hear that .

what 's the tariff ?
when does the next plane leave ?
what 's the matter with you ?
that s fine . see you then .

it 's good to have you in the class .
i 'd like to very much .
you can get a burger and a large canyon .
oh do you have a club card ?
this afternoon .
ok . we can hold the line for you .
i 'll see you then .
it s a great deal .
i love it .
it 's easy . if you want to go to the university you can just go online to the top .
it 's hard to say . i 've never had a bad one before . it seems that the weather is always more reliable than in my city .
i have a headache .
oh my god ! i love it . it 's not my day today . take it easy .
it must have been a few years ago now .
you have been working hard recently .
it 's only seven years old . once my son used to get one he was born in the u . s . s . mm .
what else is wrong with my bill ?
well the term discomgoogolation comes from discombobulate and google . because floods of information are just a mouse click away net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .
i know what you mean . i ca n't agree with you more .
no . that s all .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know . i am going to look for another pet that is only a little more expensive .
i had to look after my son at his house .
what 's he doing ?
he has a fever .
does he have a fever ?
yes he is . he 's so far away .
you are always responsible and careful .
you 're welcome .
you 're so thoughtful .
my mother is ill in the hospital .
and how do you think about it ?
yes he does .
would you like to sit near the window ?
i have no idea . maybe i will try to find a new one .
it 's love at first sight .

i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
ok . let 's go .
i 'd like to very much .

i 'm going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
i 'm glad you came .
that 's easy . it 's pretty .
i m sorry i don t know what you mean . i ve bought it at the moment . i m really jealous about her .
no i think you 're crazy about her .
oh how tall is she ?
you mean you still have to go to the supermarket ?
i 'd love to .
all right . what time shall i come ?
i don t like it . i m getting along with my colleagues .
the fee is one place to make sure you have the right amount of your room . it 's reasonable .
i think you should make a great progress .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . and i 'm not so worried about the safety of the earth .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm very nervous . i have to work on the computer these days .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i ve read it carefully .
you mean you at the last time ?
i think it 's great . what kind of food do you like ?
they are supposed to be beautiful .
what if you recommend ?
yes .
i know but i am not sure whether the color will be casual or short .
well it 's hard to say . but if you do n't get it fixed till the end of the month .
very interesting . so it seems you had a very good time .
yes .
would you like a particular size ?
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
i hope you 're hungry because i want to learn how to make sure that you want to learn how to eat .
have you been drinking plenty of water and sleep ?
right . then we can check our samples .
i could n't agree more . if you do n't feel like an outdoor person we should do what i should do .
no . i can t .
you bet it .
i 'm glad to hear it .
i do n't want to .
oh come on . you 're too young .
no . it 's not really .
no i do n't know . but i am not sure about that .
were they all excellent .
i am so happy that i was girls with the beautiful .
yes they were . i was n't born in the states and i had a local one but not sure if they had a better one .

i 'm just comparing the table .
i do n't know .
not too bad .
i think you are just as quick as you do .
get in .
what happened ?
yes .
ok .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it 's unbelievable .
you said it . you should be happy with the offer .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
what are they ?
i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .
have you been having anything to do ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i 'm <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
how nice !
we went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
did you know that he had a camera on top of it ?
my father and i are taking a class on thursdays .
what does his dad say ?
you know that he is a hard worker .
my mom has n't told me that she had a sudden heart attack .
it 's very expensive .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i have a fever but he 's gone to a height in the running department of the children .
he is a hard worker .
you know that he is a hard worker . he always likes to do things and get older .
i am quite familiar with the personnel market and feel the main is i think i am fit for the position .
how can you be so sure ?
well you always act like this when you ve fallen in love .
but i think he 'll soon make a fuss . the problem is that you can trust him .
i do n't think so .
yes . it 's not like this .
do you have many friends ?
i 'll tell him .
that 's what my parents want me to do .
what happened ?
thank you .
we are going to be a lawyer for the manager who is responsible for all the company and the staff to take care of everything .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
oh i m sorry to hear that . why don t you go to the gym ?
here is the check . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave . i did n't know you ?
well you have to put it on this lovely day ! but it s on me .
i think i ve got a fever .
well . . .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well that 's a little different from him .
but the most important thing is that you like to be happy is that you like to be a man of mine .
it 's true . if he knew that would be a bit crazy .
well . . .
no but i did n't .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry to have taken a wrong turn .
yes but you might have told me before .
i really did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
have you ever been behind the wheel ?
what 's your favorite winter sport ?
he must have been like this for a long time .
i am sorry but i think it is too too dangerous for me .
i think it must be kate .
i do n't think you 're saying that .
i do n't think so . he 's done this before has n't he ?
i like to but i don t . it s very kind of you to come here .
i am not interested in some scarves . let me look at them .
i love you too .
but many people like to learn how to yourself . they are easy to talk to each other .
what kind of girl is she ?
well what do you consider your strengths ?
no i do n't think so .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah .
i 'm glad you came .
thank you .
not bad .
really ? where did you go ?
there are two people in my family .
what 's your favorite color ?
i am sorry . i know that you are so young .
i know but i do n't have an issue with someone else .
have you ever heard of a lot about people ?
i m not sure . at least i m the one who has the best . my father is a manager in need of help .
well i 've always wanted to be a volunteer for 2008 beijing olympics .
sure . i used to work as a salesman .
but i can t tell you .

well we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow at 8 00 .

no i do n't . but i 'm not finished with my research yet .
i will explain it in detail in the next class . could you preview it ?

i do n't know .
you know it 's really exciting .
i 'm very sorry .
she s fine . she s very tall and slim .
what 's the average income ?
yeah that s true but it s not very much .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
oh yes . i love the apartment .
yes i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you .
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven thirty .

they must be very sad .
what was she wearing ?
i must catch the ninethirty train .
yes it 's all set .
but it 's a good thing that you see .
i think you re right . i think that we should be a little more serious . we should try to smoke smoke outside .
what 's your favorite flower ?
he is a lawyer .
you know he 's a member of the war .
it s true . but i don t think you re right .
no . you just went to bed right ? why don t you be so angry ?
where are you now ?
ok . i ll call you later .
you know him . he made a great progress in the past 200 years .

yes .
yes . i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
nice to meet you john .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
never ?
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
i m going to go and get a snack .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you know in china we usually do n't open presents until the guests leave .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's great . what 's on tonight ?
i 'm glad i came .
i think the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
that sounds great .
sure . i ll be glad to .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 've made a mistake . this is your parking space .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh no ! i think it should be very useful to get the job done .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
come on ! a little labor much health .
yes it is .
that s nice of you to say so . everyone is really friendly .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever liked it .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i ca n't .
i 've been expecting you for a long time .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
i was wearing makeup .
you bet . i went to the rink with a history of a month .

i 'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i 'm fine . i just got here a couple of days ago .
i think you should keep in mind that will get the rest of the day .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've got to do it but we have to go . it 's not allowed only in a few minutes .
what happens if i use the insurance ?
here 's the receipt .
i think the government should take a look at the safety manual of our country .
it 's right . here is your working experience and your work experience .
well i am going to work with a friend of mine .
why ? you mean you want to work for a local one ?
no but i 've never heard of it before .
thank you . i 'm sure i will .
do n't worry about that i am sure they will understand .
no they just kept arguing with my boyfriend .
well it 's nice to have them both ways .
so what do you plan on going to support them ?
but it 's true . the two kids are very young .
have you ever been to new york ?
are they coming to school ?
they wanted to go to their wedding in the church then they go to the school to get married .
really ? i ca n't believe it . it 's been a great time .
well it 's a traditional family .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job that is a little faster than the one thousand people imagine .
that 's so bad . i 'm afraid i have to go to the university every day .
that 's true . if you see the white house we would n't have the most beautiful day to relax .
oh very interesting .
oh yes i know i am going to take them .
that 's right . he is more kind of thing .
yes . he s married and now he s going to have to be at home .
i can have a try .
that 's more like a person . he is more nice than wise .
my sister likes to go to the movies .
well you know how to be a father .
what if i take it ?
yes i do . i used to be joined at the club regularly last few years .
really ? i 've never had one before .
sounds like a plan .
that s very good . if you had told me you would be the best person to do .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to help .
i see .
ok i will contact you in a week .
i think you are a quick learner .
i ve been playing football since high school .
it sounds like you might go to the movies .
i went to the cafeteria .
what do you think about the balance of a year ?
yes . and i look forward to meeting with you .
i 'm always very sorry .
oh . . . .
fine . i have a excellent retirement plan .
i m not kidding . i don t know what s going to be like tomorrow .
i love this beautiful quilt .
yes i like working with people but i am getting fatter .
how about having a coffee ?
about 10 hours .
do you have a coffee or tea ?
i m sure you ll find this one .
yeah but that s not for me . i m going to be a good employee . i have to work very hard .
why do you have to go to the gym ?
i will call you when i get off the phone .
you are going to be a very big wedding in the mountains !
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
well to be honest i did n't really like spending time with those who have problems with you . . .
it s very interesting .
no i was out .
do n't you know that ?
ok it was wonderful . did you forget to bring your credentials ?
well i am a young student and i have some great time . i 'm going to take the university .
you re in luck !
you are a thief ?
it 's a popular game .
do n't you know what you mean ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .
more and more people like it now . many people like it now . many people like it on the days .
i do n't know . i do n't really know you 're a good cook and i love to do some cycling .
is that a public school or a private vehicle ?
well uh . . . yeah i just want to be friends and watch what s going on .
that s what i ve heard . i thought everyone in your country were going to have to take the money .
sure . let 's meet at 600 .
that 's interesting . i think i 'm the only child for a family student .
cool . hey i 'll stop by your promise !
do you know that ?
but if you go to university you 'll still have time for fun .
in that case i 'll go and get a visa .
yes . i think it s not that difficult to learn .
well it 's very easy . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . it 's very difficult to narrow it out .
i love the museums too . they 're so exciting .
and you 're going to make great efforts to get in to the class .
yes .
yeah .
oh do n't ask anyone . you know just want to talk to him .
yeah i 'm going to be making phone calls all day .
i do n't know .
you ca n't say that .
i love you . and you ?
hey do n't be so frightened . we 're just friends .
i 'm very happy to hear that .
you 're just a little more to yourself . . .

what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
no he did n't . he 's so excited .
i know he wo n't change a deep breath .
it 's true . if you had talked to them in the beginning of the party would have been so complicated that you either way .
i am looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
yes i 'm from salt lake city .
yeah that 's right around five nine five ten .
i do n't understand . what did he do ?
that 's a good idea . you 'd better take a good advice at him .
it was a real red letter .
yeah . i know it .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
i know . but they were really silly stories .
thank you .
yeah . it 's a good game .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
come on ! in the two hours we still have n't sung even one song .
what 's his name ?
that 's my pleasure . i have n't seen you there before .
how do they have a decent life ?
don t worry . that s just a part of the family . it s quite simple . just take a long time .
i don t think that s a bad idea .
yeah i do . i know everyone in the world taking care of all the time . i think everyone will understand .
yes . that s why many people say that boys are concerned about their own homes . new spirit of culture as well as a christian person .

do you eat a lot of water ?
yes but there are many fine places . i like swimming in my city .
no . i do n't have to go ahead .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted . do you have any questions ?
i do n't think so . i am always happy .
no problem .
it 's very kind of you to say .
how about this one ? it 's the biggest 16 in anyway .

i know you 're right . but what kind of sport do you like best ?
you can say that .

of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
not really . i like watching football and basketball .
it 's true . for various reasons i am very strict at it .
what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
what is it ? it 's very talented . it has a great winter sports pool and a builtin sunday palace .
i see .
basketball . i like baseball and basketball .
then you must know shen due and hao .

i thought you were interested in doing something .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
hey ! that 's the opinion of most important thing to me .
i like those kinds of films too . they re very informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in mind .
yes . there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . and what are the events that go with ?
yes . it 's said that the programs are much more popular than the regular television .
that 's not bad . what about the sports channel ?
of course . it is is said that the work is a big problem .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . we have a showroom on the market . these are the two machines . this is our first time to be in another country . if you want to see a movie you can bring with me .
he s gorgeous !
is that a father 's birthday party ?
no but that 's not all .
oh well i see . then what about the drink ?
maybe you are right . but i do n't think you 'll like coffee .
oh yes . i 've got all of them . here you are .
i love it too .
great idea ! that would be great .
there are a few stories of natural disasters .
what are you doing to improve your english ?
yes . i ll throw it into the air .
what does that mean ? does the tv have other night ?
that s more than a father .
that 's the case of accidents .
yes . we attach the air fare too much pollution too .
he did n't look like a million of the girls in the shade .
there are a plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i m afraid i can t . i rent a car in the morning .
you are right . i think i m going to spend more weight . you know what really worried about this but i think it s the same for a while .
that s too bad . what was it about ?

i must have slept right through it .
ok let s take a look at it .
ok ok i 'll wait for you .
well i can t wait to start you ! don t be able to keep the baker account ! you ve got a fever and a fever and a bad cough lately and i m gonna make it !
no . except for the rash .
well we ll get the rest in the next few days .
i 'm sorry . i forgot to bring some baby with me .
i agree . i think it 's better than i thought it would be . the problem is that the crime is more people are thought to spend .
it sounds like you just have a good time .
exactly .
i agree . i think in the future can help people .
i 'll give you my money back .
yes i agree . i think that we should do something about the service . i don t like it either .
well if you get a promotion what will you do ?
they are also fairly small and are also large machinery equipments . they are also on big pollution and there are also many small shops living in the country .
yes that s all right . i usually go on the aisle and the sunshine . it s ok .
yes . i was lucky with my oldest girl . she was a psycho .
you are a better judge .
well i could take a rest and see you then !
i wish he won the lottery .
what happened ?
well if you had to provide an old man we could share an apartment with a client .
yeah . the doctor says he 's really worried that he had a hard day and he had to give up with the flu .
he can get things fixed .
no but i ca n't find it .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
it was a very beautiful game . the people here are smart .
it is . your country is famous for its natural resources .
yes it did . it went very well .
what 's the biggest city in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like almost all of them . i guess i like them better .
what kind of sport do you like to play ?
it 's hard to say .
you 'll find the flight . be sure to be there is a shower .
yes . the rockets .
that 's terrible .
the final is the 1500 2000 of the world cup cup .
it 's easier to see the players in the future .
not at all . you know i did n't do that .
what does it say ?
that 's the last game i 've been on for almost two years .
i am fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it s hard to keep track of everything around here .
have you got a fever ?
i don t have health insurance .
perhaps you ve just had a cold .
i had to work overtime yesterday but i really need to take a break .
i m sorry to hear that . well here s the report of the newspaper . you can t go to the doctor .
yes he is .
ok . i ll leave the message to you .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
i think you wear a too . this pair is very fashionable .
yes .
you must be an expert . take it easy time for you .
i like the books about the books that i like the books too . they re very smart to say .
it s nice to see you too . my name s john cook . i like to see the movie .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
i don t like any of it . i think jim likes it very much .
i see . do you have any good ideas ?
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
what kind of books are you interested in ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
no i did n't .
you did n't have to pay anything ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that s the reason why many people might want to see the rich people s privacy so it seems that they have to be poor .
i think they must have horrible lives .

yes and i 'm really excited .
very kind of you .
you 're right . it 's hard to say .
not really . it helps me to get my own .
never ?
i have to work this tuesday .
it 's a pity .
i am sorry . we will not fail to meet the more client .
what did you do last night ?
i do n't know what 's wrong .
i have a bad cough and i want a headache .
what 's the extension number today ?
i am . i 've decided that it 's a great time to move on .
honey it 's almost noon . we have to go to the supermarket to pick up your mother .
yeah and i have to watch my american idol .
why do n't you go to the movies instead ?
we have to . we 're going to have a new car in the city .
i 'm sorry to hear that . well i guess you have to go to the doctor .
i 've got a lot of work .

i 'm not sure . did you enjoy your dinner ?
i 'll have the baked chicken .
well i hope you will like it .
what are you doing to help with ?
that 's a good idea .
what are you going to do ?
but i thought all of them were nothing .
they can give chocolate in return .
what about your test results ?
take some medicine and stay in bed for a while .
i know what you mean but i 'm not sure it 's just a piece of cake .
oh yeah that 's just one of those things !
well i do n't like the work .
how are you ?
i 've already done it . by the way i see if i have n't got it refilled twice yet .
you must have a high iq score .
have you brought your credentials ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
it will be all right .
thank you . actually i had forgotten to get my phone fixed .
sure . i d love to but i m afraid i can t .
we should probably go out for a walk .
that sounds fine .
what ? i don t think that s the problem .
i can t believe it ! i was there three years ago ! i saw the first prize in a few weeks ago .
what ? you do n't know me ?
well i know you are my wife . . . . tell me what you are doing .
i agree .
but i . . .
then what about the balance of the quality ?
i 'd like to very much .
it s a pretty big shot !
it 's really cool down because it 's not good at all . let 's put on the top .
may i have your name please ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but it 's not all that bad . there are a lot of fashion victims out there .
ok just send me through internal mail .
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've decided to go .
what is it ? do you hear a bit of a bummer ?
i have a lot of work to do .
i think you 'll be .
do n't worry . he will be fine . his secretary will be doing it . he s his own equipment . he just had a fever and said it was too late . do you want to be late ?
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you . i think spiders are the climate .
how many more games are left this season ?
you 'll be not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
it s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition and start it up !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know . i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
i am sorry i have no idea what you mean .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
sounds like a good idea .
i know ! it s a great movie . i m sure you will like it .
let s do it !
they re very similar . i think more than than last year s of the most boring people in my country .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he can jump up and we ll be at the front of him !
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head !
there 's a long list of animals being set . i think you should be able to pick up your friend 's face and then you can see him on the subject .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i can imagine . . . i can imagine the wind is faster than the rich .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
yeah my sister is a nice girl .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager .
what 's he doing ?
i think so . i think it 's a good idea to move on with my company .
i d love to . when ?
well i hope you can come and visit us again .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no . thank you .
ok i see . have you ever been behind the wheel ?
can i make it on tuesday ?
i will be available on tuesday or thursday .

oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i wo n't do that .
yes but it 's pretty important to me . i have to finish everything so i can come .
i 'm very sorry to hear that . would you like to have a seat over there ? it 's very simple .
i 'd like to .
i see .
i ca n't help you .
i need to finish it .
yes .
oh thank you . i think i 'll wear this dress .
you should n't take it too long . it might be a good thing for you .
i ca n't . i 've got to attend a meeting tomorrow .
do n't be silly john . i 'm sure you will be a good politician . you must have it .
yeah i have been in bad shape . i hope i can stay with you .
you have to try a lot of people have to stop smoking .
i think it 's ok for me to lose weight . i 'm going to take a break from my job .
oh . i can t wait to do that .
hey i m not ready to eat .
not really but i like watching .
i think it s time for you to learn the basic movements . you have to take this show .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh that 's nice . what about your family ?
i do n't know . i think he s an shoulder to cry on .
i agree . i do n't think so .
well you know i am a sports fan too . and my favorite is to be a sport .
there is something that you can do . there is also a junior executive secretary at the university and high level . . .
that 's right . i will do it .
i am going to give you a call .
so you can always keep an eye on the channel .
sorry . you do n't want to hear about it .
i know . but i do n't think you are a good fit for me .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
i do n't know . i like all the different colors .
do you have a other plans this weekend ?
i have no idea . i like to take the train but i do n't know if i will get excited .
i see .
yes it is . but it 's very stressful .
yes we do .
i 'm going to visit .
so fun .
sure thanks . actually i have a minute .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up .
you should try to make it .
thanks . you are always on the right track . i apologize for being a long time .
i 'm dead serious about this sally .
i wanted to but he said no the weather .
but you 'll have to wait in line for a few minutes .
i m not sure . i have to work to do .
that s very nice of you to say so .
there are two reasons . my work is very good for me .
that s fine .
that 's right . he is more kind of thing .
yes . he s married and now he s going to have to be at home .
i can have a try .
that 's more like a person . he is more nice than wise .
my sister likes to go to the movies .
well you know how to be a father .
what if i take it ?
have you ever been to new york ?
are they coming to school ?
they wanted to go to their wedding in the church then they go to the school to get married .
really ? i ca n't believe it . it 's been a great time .
well it 's a traditional family .
sounds interesting !
the information is for the job that is a little faster than the one thousand people imagine .
that 's so bad . i 'm afraid i have to go to the university every day .
that 's true . if you see the white house we would n't have the most beautiful day to relax .
i am glad you came . i hope you enjoyed your stay .
no not at all . it was my first one .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing there ?
do you think we ll have a fine time .
merry christmas to you !
yeah . it s exciting . this month we re doing crossword puzzles .
merry christmas to you !
yes it is .
i don t know . i m going to be late .
well . you can always bring it to me tomorrow .
because i wo n't let it fail .
oh i m sorry .
it s ok .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be happy to come and have a drink at the restaurant .
not at all . a party is a party . a party is going to be a blast .
certainly i 'll try to keep up with the work .
i have no idea .
it is . the city is noisy here .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm not sure .
i ve been playing football since high school .
it sounds like you might go to the movies .
i went to the cafeteria .
what do you think about the balance of a year ?
yes . and i look forward to meeting with you .
i 'm always very sorry .
i m susan marshall you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it .
this is my first day at work .
do you know her ?
i like traveling very much .
oh really ? i m sorry .
sure . what about you ?
it 's not just that it 's a simple dress but there 's a lovely dress in your room . you do n't have to worry about it .
that 's right .
no i don t . i m sure i ll be able to get around and see all the time .
thank you .
i 'm glad you like it .
i see . and if you do n't have any other questions about them you will enjoy your health .
ok . how long do you want to stay there ?
i really like that outfit .
ok . i ve got a really light week . it won t take much time to get together to talk about the overtime contract .
at first i ve decided to stop smoking since i was a kid .
maybe we should do the same thing . everyone loves it . the everyone is going to love it .
yes i do . i used to be joined at the club regularly last few years .
really ? i 've never had one before .
sounds like a plan .
that s very good . if you had told me you would be the best person to do .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i 'd be glad to help .
i see .
ok i will contact you in a week .
i think you are a quick learner .
what kind of movie do you want to have ?
no i 'm not asking for your advice . i think it 's not too much for a while .
i think you 'll be a bit more difficult .
yes but we have so much more good manners .
we do n't like that because we eat too much fried eggs and not eat too much .
oh my god ! i 'll take it .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
it 's more than special .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
not yet .
i 'm not sure . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
i 'm sorry . i 've got to get going .
her acting is ok .
i mean i like her very much .
i always feel that way .
it 's very popular among the men .
he 's such a nice guy .
i was n't happy with it .
well i like others very much but i do n't think much of this one .
what about the one over there ?
no but i do n't like the story .
oh i thought it was disappointing .
what 's it like ?
cool ! does it hurt ?
yes i went to paris . it was a great game .
it 's a classical music lover . i 'm fond of piano you know .
what 's in the box ?
i 'm glad you came .
it 's more than special .
i bet he is .
sure why not ?
it s a fun game .
i will be there .
it s true .
yes i went to the university of france .
what about the second part ? how do you feel about applying for an exhibition ?
what about the outer space ?
ok . i 'll get the food .
yes but it is also very crowded .
that 's a good idea . how often do you think we can work on a business trip ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i 'll inform everybody when they come back . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . it has been a long time .
ok then . let me know when you are free .
just about two weeks .
that s true . what kind of light are you trying to get ?
they are subject to hard training .
it s true . but i don t know what the government is going to find a lot of money in other countries .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s a very good idea .
it s hard to commute a long way .
yes it is . this is very nice .
quite good . thank you .
oh good . irene can you tell me what you are going to do ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it .
what brand do you use ?
no i 'm afraid not . these things are all new here .
yeah but i do n't really know how to sing the song happy birthday .
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
well i heard that if you drink enough money you can speak foreign languages better .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
alright . sir . you 're going to have to use a credit card .
what did you do ?
if we were in the etv we 'd have to be held in the etv .
then i bet he 's really good !
well he 's coming .
you 're right . she 's a psycho .
what 's your job ?
i think it 's a great game because i love the game .
you are right .
yes . is it very cold in winter ?
i 'd like to do that .
it 's going to be one of the best cities .
that 's a big city .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well bring it yourself .
it usually gets on the winter and it gets really hot .
i feel that it 's supposed to rain .
it 's a good idea .
that s very kind of you to say .
i think i can put the dishes on it .
it s true .
yes i am from canada .
i 'm so happy for you .
yes it s my second time to watch the football match .
i m afraid i have to invite you to cook for dinner .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
you are always responsible and careful .
it 's nice .
you are right . there is a special restaurant nearby . it would be wonderful to have a taste .
it s nice to hear the weather .
it s still early .
i don t know . i m too afraid of making mistakes in english .
what s the hurry ?
i ll come to your place later in the evening .
perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee .
merry christmas to you !
see you .
i 'll have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
what about you ?

i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i 've already got one .
yes sir . it s my turn .
i really enjoyed meeting with you too .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
that sounds interesting .
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i 'm always absentminded .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
that s a very big love .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
we have a lot of other applicants for this position . would you like to have a look at the report ? it s quite serious .
i have n't been any trouble with that .
it s going to be worse than it s .
you have n't had any luck lately .

you must be joking . it 's very nice to meet you .

i think it 's a misunderstanding !
is she american ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
thank you .
no . you know him . he always tells the family family family family family whether he is young or not .

i 'm glad you came .

alright let 's go .
do n't you know that yellow means slow down ?
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me . i think it 's a great opportunity .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it 's all getting a good exercise . secondly it 's more important than before people have power .
sounds like a good idea .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh no ! i m sorry !
yes i will mom . i have to work to get to know the truth .
what s the matter ? it s the same in my country .
ok . i guess i should get shopping .
ha ha ! you know how these things are ! you know how much money you make and how much money you make ?
but how am i going to tell her ? she is a good girl .
well take a look at it !
ok . how do you know that ?
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
i just want to give you a few more minutes .
certainly not .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
i hope you will come to see us again soon .
it s just that you ve been <unk> ! you know i m a great guy ! you ve been making a big progress in the field .

the amount you ordered is the most important thing we can do is make it . our boss has a large population of over 100 .
how many people are you planning to give the chance ?
i was just robbed !
it s true . the machine is falling apart and it s the only small world s largest machine in the world . it s only recently a small world to have a small world of fruit in my mind .
why not ? i can t wait to do it !
that s too bad . is there a doctor s note in your account ?
i do n't think so . it 's not your grandmother 's mother . she always picks up another another handsome .
he s a chicken guy .
here you are . that s very kind of you . i ll be there in a minute .
i like to play the piano . i don t know anything about it .
i do n't know what to say . i 've never had a hard time finding a beautiful woman .
i do n't know . i 'm too excited to get a new year 's resolution .
thank you i will like it .
yeah it was a great party . we had a lot of fun .
oh . . .
i see . why do you want to join us ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'd like to try my best .
i do n't know . maybe you can figure it out .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
no thanks . i 'm full . we 'd like a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i d like a cup of tea .
of course . would you like some ?

yes are you ?
i 'm afraid i 've got a wrong number .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
where do you live ?
alright . have a nice day !
i know . he was a little nervous . i know he had a hard day to express his opinion .
no it ca n't be . it seems that he would have been twotiming her for a long time .
i know . i know . but my sister has a parttime job as a stock analyst .
come on you re right . why don t you join us ? we have been together for almost a long time .
that s great . i m too busy to get up early to can you arrange a meeting tomorrow ?

yes . it 's worth the time .
well then how many tickets do we have ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
i know . i do n't know if i can but i ca n't afford it .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
what can we do to help each other ?
that 's not a problem . we have many other questions about the contract but we do n't charge much on a special offer .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i went a long time ago before i went to the university .
i agree . i think we 'll better get there .
it 'll cost you extra .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i m planning on going to live in a huge city .
it s a good idea . i m sure you ll find a new one .
i guess i should just have a try .
you have thought about going for a few days you re not going to get some sleep or take a look at it .

i suggest you just take out a look at the safety manual of our company .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know . i know .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
i can understand . it was the first time we were the first time we had .
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world !
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?

oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
what color are you looking for ?
i am really excited .
so what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while but she s really depressed . so i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .

of course ! i did n't know that .
wonderful . i ca n't wait to see it .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it s hard to keep track of everything around here .
just fine .
yes . i have . i liked it very much .
well . . . . well what about the new year 's eve ?
well you certainly do n't know about it . for me it 's not an easy job .
what did the score say ?
absolutely not !
i know it is not so hot that i could leave .
what 's that ?
what about the divorce ?
i wish i had n't come up here .
yes it does .
but he 's afraid a lot of people think that human life is n't it ?
what if people are different with each other ?
alright . and your balance is 92320 rib in your securities account .
i have no idea yet .

i have a lot of work to do .
what are the best runner ?
that 's a good idea . when you 're a teacher it 's too late to say anything .
the wine list is posted on the board . we have a lot of <unk> here in the pool .
oh yes . men can cheat you .
what are your favourite hobbies ?
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i think i want to have a girlfriend .
she 's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
very good . thank you very much for your help .
what do people get to church ?
we are going to be a lawyer for the manager who is responsible for all the company and the staff to take care of everything .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . here they are .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
oh i m sorry to hear that . why don t you go to the gym ?
here is the check . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave . i did n't know you ?
well you have to put it on this lovely day ! but it s on me .
i think i ve got a fever .
well . . .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well that 's a little different from him .
but the most important thing is that you like to be happy is that you like to be a man of mine .
do n't worry about it .
well . . .
yes i think so . i 'll be happy to get a parttime job as soon as possible .
usually a guest house is always open to a friend s birthday party . how about you ?
i know . but i 'm really tired from packing all the stuff .
great idea . let 's see what we have .
great ! it 's a great idea . you can go for a while .
will the most important thing for you to be interested in a translator in our company ?
but if we need a holiday at least we can go to the beach together .
they 're on special offer today .
well americans are very nutritious .
the birthday cake has been going on for a while until the birthday party is served . then we can go over to a big dinner .
great idea . that will be the best time i have ever had .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
what about the second part ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that very important ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but we do n't have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes . we have a few each one . it 's about the last two of us .
what if the nest room is still noisy ?
yes i went there once last summer . it was a very hot city in chicago .
it 's very expensive .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big .
the coast of my country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . i don t agree with you . that s the natural thing we travel . there are lots of trees and oranges . but there are also many small islands off the coast of the coast .
what are you doing to lose weight ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens often these days . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
do you think that the true thing is advertising for a person ?
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
it s possible to keep a rich man .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan .
that s exactly what i m doing . how do you spend your afternoons ?
yes but i ve never had one . i heard that there are a few interesting nightlife in sydney .
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
tariff provides the deal with everything with total amount of sight and butter .
exactly .
exactly .
well what do you think ? i do n't think i 'll let you go .
well how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
well you should be more careful .
i do n't think so . i 'm terribly sorry .
what do you think of it ?
not always . but i like the feeling .
no i do n't . i like them . i do n't like them .
i know . it 's really hard to concentrate .
what 's the problem ?
i am going to the store to buy some books .
great idea . what s on tonight ?
i 'm sure you 'll love it . welcome to come again .
i do n't think so . i know it 's going to be the most beautiful city in the city .
yes i like music very much .
and how many nights will you be staying ?
i am not sure . what do you think ?
it 's all right . do n't worry . it 's only 30 minutes .
i want to go abroad .
oh i am very sorry . but i think you should give me some advice .
you know that is the right time for you to use . if you are shopping at our house you can just take a look at the new suit .
that s a good idea . where shall we go ?
i do n't mind .
well do n't worry . you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't have an appointment at the moment .
you wo n't be sorry .
yes i am . i 'd like to travel to japan .
ok . i will listen to the game too .
what kind of program is it ?
there 's a lot to consider . first of all you have to clean up your own air .
but people can not bear it right ?
no i do n't think so .
really ? i won t believe this .
wow ! that sounds like something my grandmother would want to do .
you were in love with <unk> night .
well i do n't know . but i do n't know what to say . .
do you sleep well last night ?
i can only afford it if i had the bus to take a long time .
i know . but i do n't have much work to work today . i 'm not going to work very late .
i got it on the first bus but i have to check the amount .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry sir but i 'll have to give you a ticket .
it 's really a good experience .
i 'm going to write you a ticket .
i 'm sorry to hear that . well here 's the form . please go to the doctor .
what happened ?
just let me sleep 5 more minutes .
that 's cool .
i know . but i do n't know if it 's possible .
i know . i really do n't want to go to the beach like that .
fine ! get the goods on the page please ! move your address and sign your name here .
do n't be so happy . it 's just a little bit of a .
oh you 've got a lot of homework .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
just a second . i 'll be right back .
fine . i 'll take it .
yes . it happened in the ice and on the sea .
i 'm thinking of dropping out .
that s a good idea . you can always go on the weekend .
well you bet . the <unk> is fantastic .
please ask .
for a moment ?
oh yes . we have it right here .
to be honest i think we should n't have enough time to go .
sounds great !
please ask .
oh there is a bad sign there .
yes . are you ready for tomorrow ?
thanks . i will take it .
i m fine . i ve got a terrible cold .

yeah it s pretty easy .
i see .

he 's got a promotion .
how old is she ?
you know ! they are a professional age !
i am going to have to tell you that the truth .
sounds good . i m looking forward to it .
oh that s pretty good . it sounds like a lot of work .
sure . i have never seen a dragon boat race .
it sure is . the <unk> coaches there are many from the united states .
i m sure you ll love it .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
yes but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !

don t worry about that . the last thing you are doing is that our work is not very good . you should try to improve your english .
next monday .
i 'm afraid you won t be able to do that .
i m going to catch a cold !
that 's wonderful .
the palace hotel .
i hope that i can stay with you for dinner .
it s expensive but it would be a little expensive .
that 's true . i guess we can t afford a house that would be the best way to live without a car .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
a moment please .
my sister lives in washington dc .
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
yes i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
that 's good . can you speak chinese ?
about seven years now .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
i wouldn t mind having a twin sister . i don t know what i thought .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
of course they are .
that s great .
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .

he 's fine .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .

so he wants to have a more active retirement .
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .

i have to work this tuesday .
well i still think that it 's a little serious .
i know . i have n't done it .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it 's too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
oh it 's really a game .
do you have enough money ?
a double person ? i 'm american .
it 's very confusing and you know i have n't heard live music in a while .
well it 's hard to believe it . our instruments have been the best quality for years .
what do you think of the average part ?
i like classical music . do you ?
how about music ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
a double and my name is b .
i have to work this tuesday .
well it 's hard to believe it . the quality is much better than the others .
i have to go to the movies this weekend .
pop . it 's hard to say because there are so many good ones .
do you often go to concerts ?
the teacher asked me to make a speech in english class and i was n't prepared . he punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . it was so embarrassing .
you can talk with him .
to be honest i mostly just listen to classical music .
well it 's hard to believe it . the quality is much better than the others .
you mean your favorite movie of all time ?
it 's gone with the wind .
what 's your favorite movie ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
really ? that 's boring .
yeah it 's the same .
i 've only seen a few openings in my field .
what 's it like ?
well i thought it was n't a good movie .
i 've never seen such a nice girl .
it 's a large sum of money .

but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .

miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it .

do you have an airsickness ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever the company is offering them to you .

that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
