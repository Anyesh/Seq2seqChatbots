what do you have to do ?
i usually ride a lot of options . i also have a lot of options .
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
well i swim and run every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it 's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week if i can .
i would like to buy a for my girlfriend . could you make a recommendation for me ?
ok . you can buy one here .
what 's the difference between the two ?

it is a job at a recruitment agency .

yes . let me see . oh look at the shirt .
i think it looks nice .
yes . i 'm going to be on the same day .

i think that is a good idea . when are you going to find a new apartment ?
yes it 's on our back door .
but why ? is n't there anything else wrong with them ?
i have to work this tuesday .
is that right ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it 's a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .

what 's he like to say ?
i think it 's better for me to meet him .
yes here you are .
thank you .
yes we do . but we have only excellent english in college .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
i 'd like to have this kind of cigarette cream .
sounds good . we 'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice .
yes . go straight ahead and you 'll see the bus .
do you know when it leaves ?
you should get off at the corner of del mar and hill .
thank you . where is the fare ?
but where do you want to go ?
i 'll go with you and watch what 's going on .
well then may i suggest a manicure ?

wait a minute !
i 'm afraid there 's a mistake .
it does n't matter . i just do n't like such a thing .
it 's nice but it 's rather too heavy . i ca n't afford it .
what you 're paying for madam is the ingredients . it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a feel .
i think i might like the fine job .
certainly . here you are . take a look .
sure . what kind of soup would you like ?
i have n't been to the theater in a long time . how about you ?

fine . i 'll take one .
it costs 125 dollars a month .
yes it 's our best price .
it 's already reduced 20 .
that s right . no one else has informed me of that so many golfers find difficult to avoid . the insurance number is committed to the following criteria to decide which to buy . they re willing to change the deductions
do n't worry about it . just try to get the basics .
i am sorry to say i must have to make sure that the price is on the same page .
i 'm sorry but it 's still a bit more than a bedroom in a shop .
i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .

oh yes . he s holding a bunch of books .
okay . let 's take a look at the battery .
to be honest i think most people are cruel to pets or other animals . i don t think it 's a way to stop seeing others from others .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start . shall i go with some ?
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it does n't matter .
why not ?
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
hi mary .
really ? what s so great about it ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
okay . i 'll be sure to take a look .
we ll need to find something similar to the bedroom . it s just a drop in the back .
i will .
sure . here 's your receipt .
thank you i 'll be right back .
yes you have a reservation .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
i need to cancel an account .
that s right . now that there are four major workers that can handle . and you can have a both ways of little research .
how many nights a week is it ?
200 yuan a night .
can i pay by card ?
i can try but i think of paying for cash is the rent at the moment .
it does n't matter .
why not ?
ok . do you know where the post office is ?
thanks a lot .
this bus does n't take you directly there . you 'd have to change buses twice . i suggest you walk . it 'll take you less than 20 minutes .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .

no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
yes . it was four years ago when i was in college . i do n't think it was that bad .
did it happen any time ?
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .

i 'll be glad to finally make it .
yes . i ve got a very good idea .
yes sir . where to ?

the journey is worth while . i ca n't wait to check it .
i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .

thank you very much .
hi . it s tony calling from the dentist s office . is lily there ?
what would you like ?
thank you . how much is it ?
yes i 'm here to ask you a few questions .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that would be great . what kind of safety ?
see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! i like that place .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space .
ok i see . why do you want to come up to our branch for our imports ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh i 'm sorry . do you think we 'll have to go out for our block ?
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
25 dollars .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of lunch .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
when do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
see you then .
ok . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it 's especially for the construction of the city centre .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
it is a little bit expensive . do you have any cheaper ones ?
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
yes i am worried about that . i ca n't agree dan .
i know . it 's my fault . i am a little worried . what do you do to lose ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
oh i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
i do n't know what happened to me . i just lost it and i am so successful .
what are you talking about ? i do n't know what to him . .
poor boy . you should get him a try . he will start to the hospital for five minutes .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
i do n't know . i never went to a church before .
hi mike !
wow ! what happened ?
i did n't get the sleep until i wake up .
fine . thank you .
not a lot . i 've been pretty busy .
how have you been ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
of course not . the most important thing is to be here . first you can do more professional skills .
thank you for calling me .
i am completely serious .
since yesterday .
i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a team player .
what is a surprise ?
yeah . i 'm sorry . it 's our policy .
hmm . . . you know why do n't you ask her out ? he fought against slavery and secession at a time in the morning . he at least one time like the other day to go higher . he at times he was not interested in talking to him .
but i have to be careful about how to fall for his age .
yes . see you then .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you could come over to the party with me tonight ?
sure we do . what is it ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent . we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
oh yeah i 've been thinking of getting a better job .
no you don t have to . this is the first time you come in .
i can t wait to start the !
oh . . . i don t know what you re doing ! let s go on a drinking .
what do i do with all the appliances ?
can you play tennis with me ?
oh ! we are out of the window ! it 's not what we need . do you get them all ?
cool ! each contact comes in a very game !
i m sorry . i m going to have to call the police .
yes . i am looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .
are you looking for a wallet ?
what s wrong with that ? i think i ll need a polaroid .
are you serious ?
i have passed the five hundred times . how about you like it ?
with pleasure .
oh this one . it 's very nice .
that s true . how much are you looking to spend for every month ?
how about this route ? we only have 20 minutes to go .
i have found an exhibition of animals used for . you can buy an exhibition of animals here .
. . . hey !
i think that s why many people buy clothes . i think it s amazing .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the reason that it 's a garage sale . .
yes i do . how about this one ?
there s nothing in the particular place that you want to have in mind .
here s your card . you can get a refund .
oh yes .
you are welcome !
good morning . i have a bad cough and i want to see an internist .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
yes all the choices you have to pick up your teeth you are here for the interview .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
oh really ? i really love it .
that 's it .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
good . just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to buy some flowers . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
what about this one ? this one is a wonderful one .
what about the rest of your items ?
well i think this is a very nice neighborhood .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but i still remember it when i saw the red light in the theaters . so i am taking it back to the car store .
can you tell me about this ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it is on the basement level .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
how do you feel about the rubik 's cube ?
so what about this red wine ? how do i get it all out of it ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'm going to listen to the radio .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well my pants are very <unk> . they 're capris .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no i do n't think i can . i 'll take a taxi to get there before i finish .
thank you very much .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
damn !
i want to buy some records .
certainly . the first one is to built a product with a very popular market . it is the best choice for you to sell more than one month .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well . oh and watch movies online as well . oh and watch movies online as around the other day !
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no you don t have to . here is the annual warranty . take your dollars and we ll give you your lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky

i was told to come in for an interview as requested .
this is the first time i think we will have to put you in a few minutes .
why not ?
i know what you mean . i just want to get her some night and it s not her neighbours from the place .
i can t do that . is there anything else i can do for you ?
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
how about winter ?
yes . we have many different kinds of scarves here . what about this one ? it is the latest in style .
how can you raise the better ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . it s necessary for you to pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it might be . but there is also some <unk> in the scenic spots . what about trying something else ?
but i think the rain may last .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great shopping cart .
oh no . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
you 're right . i love the apartment .
and how do you like working for us ?
the rent is 400 dollars a month .
that s too expensive .
what is it that ?
i don t know why it s so popular .
that s not a problem .
what will you do if you don t have any questions ?
would you mind telling me that i won t go any lower than 1050 .
tell me what you want to know .
i am afraid not . i 've already gone to the conference center of the sunday .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i like it but i don t like it . i ve always been feeling great and kind of like cooking and i hate having a strong variety of programs .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
actually i do like chinese food . but i do n't like thai food . . .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . i will take them .
about two weeks .
what kind of shoe would you like ?
an interesting job .
an ordinary one ?
i 'll take a dozen .
i m sure you ll find something similar to .
what about the insurance policy ?
yes . i like the design of this house . it s very cheap .
one .
fine . how much do you want ?
whatever you prefer .
let me show you some information about our store . they re right up .
of course . let s go .
this is he .
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think it 's just the right one .
i 'm happy to hear that . how much are you looking for ?
fine we 'll be expecting you then .
great . i 'll be at your house at about 530 . happy birthday .
yes . i think i could get some .
i 'm ready to go .
thank you .
no . that 's all .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
oh yes . the price has been reduced by 50 .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it is . i 'm going to take care of it .
let s rock n roll .
i think you ll find it there . i think it s because of the marketing you can t see the sign .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
oh dear ! i like this one .
i think it s wonderful . let s go !
well the wall is a park in the hallway . the bathroom is from the coast .
i see . we will take it .
right now we are about 30 .
well you can have it for eleven hundred as a friend .
oh look at the view from the window .
i can t stand the loud noise in the city !
but i 'm not used to looking up every new word when i 'm reading a novel .
oh my god ! it 's a classic .
i love the bamboo design and the design of this beautiful view . what is the most cool color in the world ?
i agree . let 's go look at that next .
that 's right . we will inform you in a moment .
that s the usual thing you can think of .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
oh hi . this is mary . i 'm calling about the apartment of our store .
i need to see your apartment .
i am going to move right now .
let 's go to the park this way .
i 'm afraid i have n't got a meeting from the airport .
fine . i will begin next monday at 8
i have a friend who lives in front of the university .
we have a deal then .
i 'm finished .
we still have 60 days left .
yes . i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? <unk> ?
yes it is .
history .
that 's interesting . can you tell me what your educational background and your occupation ?
ok . do you think i can have the details for you ?
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yes . it 's an excellent system .
oh it 's interesting . i 'll take it . is it your other one ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i 'm serious .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are the different workshops that are available ?
i 'm sure you 'll like fisherman's wharf . it 's a popular tourist spot . be sure to try it .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i 'm sorry . i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
oh that 's what i want to say .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . if you need any other things please let us know .
ok . please take a seat . do you need any cut in a few minutes ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . what about tomorrow afternoon ? are you sure ?
yes . what 's the rate for a single room ?
ok please fill in the form first .
not too long . cut a little off behind and on both sides .
what kind of style do you want ?
this style is not short . i 'm sure . i 'll try this one .
you are welcome . i 'll see you again tomorrow .
not bad . you are a good accountant .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no . it 's very easy .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
my cut is not feeling . i feel terrible .
i 'll give you a blood pressure . it 's hard to wash here . here 's the twenty . you can use the electric mixer .
yes they are . we love them a lot .
it 's a serious problem . i make a note of my professors and the it from the government . and i 'm also going to have to pay for a while . if you want to study i can help you .
i 've got a few pounds of that before . i 'll just have a look .
yes we have .
how about the one next to the highest price ?
how about a scarf ?
maybe you are right .
oh i 'm sorry . but you ca n't just pay the price . i 'm hoping you have n't come up here .
what are you doing ?
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
ok let 's go check out the kitchen next .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
that 's great . let 's go !
we can do it ourselves .
i 'd like to buy some new shoes .
let 's hit the information .
i have n't had any complaint about this home before . i would have to say that they would offer our own home car .
ok let 's go .
i think that is a good idea . when are you going to find a new apartment ?
yes it 's on our back door .
but why ? is n't there anything else wrong with them ?
i have to work this tuesday .
is that right ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it 's a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually i prefer the mountain may be dangerous in the afternoon .
ok i will .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
not really .
well it looks very nice .
i like variety shows but i do n't like any kind of dishes .
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
yes . i 've been invited over to a friend 's . and you ?
so do i . you like some soup ?
it 's my pleasure . would you like some soup ?
how about a place of sichuan food ?
mmmm . . . . let me think . . . this way please .
it 's really good to have chinese tastes . i would like to listen to some chinese food .
of course i do . but i do n't need to worry about what i 'm going to do .
i need to get home .
yes i need some advice about chinese antiques . do you like to try some ?
oh i see . so the saying we can get together and set up the transfer .
you can write the application form and let me know if you need anything else .
rin ?
you re welcome .
let me look . i think . what about the price ?
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
your price has gone up sharply has n't it ?
the only reason i want is to buy some clothes for the products .
ok . where do you go ?
they are the things that make up the atom such as electrons and protons .
is there a dead animal somewhere in here ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
but i like the fashion sense . i am not a big fan of korean shows .
yes of course . there are many famous paintings and inscriptions on the mountain .
how about the club ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i do n't know . i tried to buy the most of the older people around but they 're so expensive .
the one that was the cheapest but the judge was very low .
you have a very good taste . it is the very seller 's head of the company .
the fee is 25 cents a day .
i hope that it is a your company because of our new products all well .
that 's fine .
yes . i would like to go to new york for my christmas vacation .
sure . do you have the receipt ?
yes here you are .
that 's good . i 'd like to see them .
i do n't want to .
go and try it on .
that 's okay . if it 's not there 's any problem .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford that .
ok . how about this pair ? i want them to get them by you .
ok . i will take it .
that 's very sensible of you .
i 'm afraid not sir . in fact i ca n't be able to do that .
all right . if you would like me to give you a lift .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . we 'd be able to do our preparation and board games while i am here .
here you are .
thank you .
yes i think so . if i come back to the company after i get the refund .
i think the only thing is that most people have <unk> that is great . they say you want to buy and then go on to the butcher 's .
sure what do you want to know ?
i do n't know how to say it in english .
do i have any other choices ?
is there any special features that you would like to give them any picture of your home ?
do you have any tried for a dessert ?
then you have to get off at the next stop .

how about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ?
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music .
well i like doing sweet and sour sauce best . it 's a typical chinese dinner .
last night i would also like a glass of juice to start with and eating . if you would like a cup of coffee or tea would you like to start with it .
we do n't have a lot of time .

when will the library be here ?
no by train . i think it 's much safer than bus .
what does your work consist of exactly ?
no but i could take the bus .

it 's a good idea to save the price of the gasoline .
the car park is still on the bus .
we can get both at the cafeteria and ask for help from the zoo .
how about the subway entrance to the zoo ?

i 'm reading a book about a friend of mine .

i won 200 to spend on any books of my choice .

you re welcome .
nothing thanks . i 'm just not a bit tired .
how are you doing ?
i got a job offer from dell .
but i have no idea how to save the life .
i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . do you smoke and have your face ?
i agree with you but he may do it too .
i want to get a pie .
what does he do ?
i have been studying english for my chemistry exam .

i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
next monday .
oh it 's hard to say .
how about your mother ?
actually it 's not that good . i have n't had a lot of chance to learn yet .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle . what about the road ?
i think that we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . i would rather have a try . i do n't like animals experiments though .
i 've got an idea . why do n't you buy a new one ?
i suppose so . and what about the subway ? is that more expensive ?
no but i could take the bus .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
i would really like to hear that . it would be great to take a really good apartment .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
how about this one ?
yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people .
well i 'm sure you will .
i am happy to have a look at the flowers in the house .
what 's the matter ?
i have a high fever and feeling terribly bad .
i know but that 's what i am worried about . i ca n't do it well .
i bought this here yesterday but it does n't work .
i know . i bought some chow mein at the same time .
what about taking a chance to see the results on the treadmill first ?
fine ! how are you ?
not bad . what about you ?
i 'm still a little . what about you ?
to be honest i 'm a student and i have n't had a chance to do that .
have you ever thought about getting a parttime job ?
let 's just hope it does n't get hotter .

do n't believe it . i 'm not in the mood for good news .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
thank you . i like it very much .
i have to work this tuesday .
you are right . i 'm not so familiar with the customers but i do n't know what to do .
i think so . most students just kept trying to handle their english .
yes i have . i 'm so sorry about these .

i think it 's the problem . i 'll give you a piece of cake . he will even give you a certificate .
i see . do you have the <unk> proposal yet ?
it 's really a good game .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
but i think it 's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math .
well not really .
i 'll be there .
i went to the english class in the international school and i studied english literature .
that s fine . see you on friday .
but there is n't a chance that is our one major interest is not .

it 's rather serious . it 's rather serious .
well . . . i was just thinking about how clear the sky gets around . i felt under a little more and more interesting .

oh what did he say ?
you should have known of it . you know it 's hard to say . no matter you were working so hard . why not take a job and study .
it 's so exciting !
i went to a dance class in the mountains with my family last night .
that 's better than mine . it was n't the first time you did several years ago .

and what do you think about it ?
i think it is . i 've been having a big problem sleeping .
it was a serious game .
i think the regular customers will be quite familiar with the interview if you have any questions .
here you are .
thank you .
yes . i do n't know anything about the american tutor .
sure . that s not a problem . do you have the list of courses you want to <unk> semester ?
yeah . here s my list . i m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
yeah that s perfect . what about the subjects for your minor ?
oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental <unk> consumer psychology and .
ok ! do you want to have them made of you feel like an idiot ?
for what ?
really ? i 'm glad that we 've been having there .
yes i think so .
i think that the bill is too high . that s one of the conditions of the job you want .
good idea . i need to take a bath first .
yeah . it s about time to eat and relax . the first thing that we did is to talk about a history of college entrance exam .
wow ! so what do you think ? do n't you know the taxi driver 's license ?
of course . this is the latest model . it is a brand new product .
oh yeah . i know .
have you ever experiences a job before ?
then i ll have to take a look .
i m fine . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
yes . don t you ?
no i do n't .
i want to know what 's on the bus .
i 'm studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow .
why do you want to be an english teacher ?
yes . are you ?
yes . and you ?
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
my god !
i 'll have to stay in bed for one day .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very strict with us .
i see what you mean . he gives me a perfect husband .
yes he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
here .
you are right . that 's where we are now . you must be fishing .
yes it is .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i have a terrible headache .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
oh is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to be in the future . i m not sure .
i think you re right . i d be able to do a lot more research on the company .
that s a good idea . i m sure you can do well .
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . and when i was done we deserve to get the reply .
i won t keep up with the good work . everyone knows what they are .
it s going to be difficult to make a good impression . for example you should should take care to appear wellgroomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
what about the iguana ?
that s great . is the everything alright with the house ?
i think you re right . i think there is an interesting one .
he is really a hard worker .
very well . thank you .
no problem .
i need to return a book .
what 's the problem ?
i need to use the internet .
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just take them back to the station .
i 'm sure you will .
thank you .
it 's a great new experience to me . i can enjoy watching the sea and watching .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! they 're amazing !
are you more of a human resources store ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do you like to play ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
i have a building . you know there is a building on the right . i don t know what the building is .
is there a chance you could contact me ? i know it is a little bookstore . there is nothing i can do about it .
it s a really useful piece of equipment for a person . i can explain it .
we have a beautiful face in the past many people . they are my older sister and looks like a winner . this is the big one .
why is that ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to buy a for my girlfriend . could you make a recommendation for me ?
have you made a reservation ?
i have it . here you go .

we are going to need a space to help . would you like to find a place for me ?
how about going to english corner with me ?
oh thanks . here 's the card .

but we 'll be careful .
i worked for a bank manager .
what is the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
how about your mother ?
i 'm sorry but it 's not a very good thing .

well there are several william in an emergency you may have a look at the timetable to bring in the right direction .
what about ok ?

yes i think so . go down this street and then turn left .
you should do it yourself .
i 'm afraid there is .
here you are .
we could take a few days off the weekends . the summer is the best season for the summer . i think it 's the most famous for its beautiful summer palace .
i 'm thinking of taking you to the movies .
i thought you were taking the exams for getting into the university .
no . i think i know .
yes . i think so . but if i want to look at the computer i do n't think it 's a very simple question .
ok shall we make a coffee first ?
i 'll pick you up at about six thirty .
i 'm not sure which i should have but i have the little idea i am not sure which i should have left .
this one fits me well . how much is it ?

well i know him . he 's too tall .
yes . take it easy . i think it 's much better than before .
yes it is . i can take it .
did you get any honors or awards at your last year ?
i think i m very good at planning .
would you please fill out this form ?
of course not . you can go to the computer and finish your resume . then you can make up your mind .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
that 's how i go .
they 're all right . they 're on the wall behind you .
it could be completed in four years .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your seat . it 's very kind of you .
is it possible for you to consider the insurance by air ?
but thank you very much all the same .
wow ! you 're not going to be kidding me ! it 's not a real figure of my job .
in the past 5 years i was in the high school . and i was told that i 'd like to take a look if i had done that .
the basically speaking you need to make sure that you get what you need to do .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i do n't know . i get a hold of those little around but i just do n't know what to do with them .
these books are excellent . i can only read them . the <unk> will be excellent .
we are going to have a great time .
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i 'll call you back later .
do we get a day off from school then ?
i have been making a lot of progress . what about you ?
how ?
yes . it 's enough for us to write a letter of recommendation .
thank you .
to begin with i 'm quite sure .
i see . can i prepare the supper ?
we 'll have whatever .
i 'm sorry ms . jones . i 'll call you back later .
by now i 'll tell you what .
to tell you the truth i 'm not very interested in it .
i want to know about the fees you have in mind .
have you taken your driving test yet ?
but it 's not a dress .
why don t you try it on ?
to begin with i would say i really did n't like the job .
what were your major in all day ?
i will . do you think i can make it up before ?
how about afternoon ?
i need to return a book .
do you have your library card ?
i sure do .
what ?
yes i 'd like to be in the library please .
i need your library card please .
oh that s okay . thank you very much .
how about some fish ?
thank you .
what ?
i think you ll need to take your library card .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i really do n't like her .
that s ok .
because i 'm not feeling well .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
they did n't say anything about the family .
i do n't think she will .
i can t wait to see him .
but i think it is important to be our friends .
but i like its color .
well i ca n't wait to see it .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i really do n't think it 's about time you have to think about what you want to do .
it 's so interesting that i can enjoy them and enjoying the sun in the summer .
what a jerk . he does n't deserve you .
you should get plenty of sleep .
i m a nurse . what do you think of it ?
yeah i 've got a few pounds of water . perhaps i can go to the gym right now .
yes .
i m sorry . you ll have to wait in line for a moment .
i m here to see your credit card . you re ready for it .
do you have your cell phone with you or call the office ?
you 're quite sure about that . how about everything ?
that s true . but she says she is a hard worker .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
i think you are right . it s important to be healthy . but i m sure you will love it .
okay . then i can just throw the ball up .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm serious .
yes but you should have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how would you like to pay for it ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
congratulations ! that s a great idea .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what 's your favorite ?
what 's your hearing ?
yes .
well it does n't matter . i just can t wait to see it again .
i 'm afraid not .
so what do you do ?
you smashed my bumper in .
how did you know that ?
yes but i bought it in a store .
how did it happen ?
exactly it gives me a lot of pressure .
would you like to have a perm ?
yes it 's a bit tight .
i see . we have a series of white color designed and black could be found in this color .
i think it looks like it should be on your face .
are you serious ?
can you help her with that ?
i hear her from a cat .
have you been involved in any club activities this weekend ?
i do n't think i 'm in a hurry . i feel comfortable .
i hope that you did n't expect the best .
i 'm having a party this saturday .
what is it ?
a little . i 'm a little worried about my mother .
good !
she 's a friend of amy .
yes . we can do that .
she 's very nice .
oh she likes you . she is a nice girl .
i feel sorry for her .
what was the score ?
of course ! i did . but i don t know why they would have to leave me .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
yes just a minute please .
maybe we can trade them .
i 'll get over to it for you .
maybe we can trade them .
have you tried to come to one of your designs ?
how can you do that ?
it 's not the same . it 's made of wood .
what would you like to see ?
is he ?
what about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ?
yes i did . i was in a meeting with the manager .
yes i know . i have been very busy but i 'm afraid i must go to work today .
no not really . i 'm just going to have to take a look . it 's not that i have to do .
yes here you are .
how many children do you have ?
so i thought i 'd come to the song next morning .
i got home .
you must be joking . those two are beautiful .
i 'm not too worried . he 's a security guy . he 's a big fan of swimming .
well it was about to raise money . i had to buy a new one for my boss for two years . now i am still under a lot of good boss . if the boss had a small changes she got a small stock now it turned out to be a little bookstore . so i guess i had to explain that i had to him in the police .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . it 's our fault .
ok .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . but i know how to get on the tickets .
so you 're telling me you 're going to dinner ?
john .
it 's the whole thing you can do now .
well it was n't too bad . at lease i 'm alive .
i guess she was n't done that .
do n't bother . i 'm sure she 's right . she 's a very good friend .
yeah . oh was the other one there ?
yes i did . i passed an antivirus software program in the past .
cool ! i ca n't believe he can go to the beach like that . he is so cute .
do n't you think they are shy ?
that 's very sensible . but they 're also terrible . let 's go !
i can tell you at the time that we will meet again in 10 minutes .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
yes . we can not make it .
yes i hear .
well . . .
i think i 'll give him a call .
are you ? i ca n't wait to go there with you .
do you have a credit card ?
no . we 'll take a taxi .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
yes but i doubt if i get it .
how much do you like this one ?
no . i 'd like to go .
yes of course . i 'm really looking forward to it .
i really appreciate it . thanks .
i 'm afraid not . the invitation said that i would like to go to the park with two people .
you really did n't have very traditional wedding did you ?
yes . do you know that the room room room number is lie about ?
that 's great !
what was that you just said ? last one . . ?
how about the new programmers ?
i will ! i could use some good luck !
can you tell me about all the notes you have in the ?
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
how do you think of this job ?
yeah . i bought a pair of trousers last week .
that 's really nice . can you read it ?
i 'm a guide . i 'll go into the personnel market to have a look at it .
is it free ?
yep . i 'm not going to be late .
no thank you . i ca n't . i 've had enough .
do you like any milk ?
no thanks . we 'll have cake for those .
good morning mr . sandals . could you tell me what the full of services are for the or in this office ?
good morning .
i think i will start my new job as a bartender .
well i think you 'll be the flu . there 's a lot of it going around .
thanks . have a nice day .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
oh i get off the phone now .
that s amazing . you got a good pay here didn t you ?
i know ! but my boss won t like this . they re always talking about me about how to cash it .
come on ! don t be silly !
you re doing what ?
well i 've found a job a little bit . it 's so beautiful .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
i have to say maybe i can find a parttime job .
i am sorry to hear that .
it 's ok .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
yeah this place is boring . it 's a good place for picnic .
do n't stay up late .
we 'd better go to a musical comedy next time . i was very excited about it .
ok . hurry up !
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
what s the problem ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
no not really . but i like it very much .
what do you think of the aluminum pan ?
i have to work this tuesday .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she s 18 .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean by saying ? it 's true that .
do n't get me wrong ! it will just be hard to say goodbye to the interviewer .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
that 's a great idea . let 's see if we can go to a bar . that will be good .
good . let 's go now .
how about cheese cake ? this is a little tight on the waist .
it was me . i am so sorry .
that 's ok .
i had to move it so that it was n't too good .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
you wo n't change your mind .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
i will but let 's go to a disco after dinner .
you want to ask everyone to help us ?
i see .
it 's the time for me to relax . i 'm going to quit this job and do something different .
is it ok to be there ?
i was late for work today .
i turned on a bridge when i was a child .
do you think that she 'll be able to come in at the hospital ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i need to get on the internet .
you ca n't be serious .
i need help turning them on .
that 's amazing . it 's really important to have a good time for you .
i bought a bottle of whisky and soda .
how about your steak ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
well we 'd like to have some vegetables instead . please try them .
it feels good . but i really like it 's a bit salty .
we hope your stay here a pleasant one !
sure . sounds great . i 'll have the wine list .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
not at all . you can ask the policeman over there .
we have all kinds of tea . do you like coffee ?
yes i think i like it very much .
yes here you are .
thank you .
not today . do you have any cash with me ?
no . you need n't .
but what about this one ? it 's a lovely color .
i have a feeling that i 'm very interested in the job .
this is mr . stern .
i want to take out a bath .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is wrong ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
i can understand .
i really do n't like my rose . i have to go to her for a while .
that s great . i ll see you later .
oh how about the food ?
does it close at six ?
i think you should give them a call if you can .
what does that mean ? will you find a place near the university ?
i m just wondering if you re interested in the job ?
how about the price ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
well let me take a look . . . i m off for an interview of our customers .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine .
ugh . . . . so how long is the flight ?
it is hard to say . but i am not sure . maybe it will take more than one day . so . .
what s wrong ? why ! get me to the gym ?
nothing . i just had a bad day today .
i was late for work today . i forgot to call you to pick up a couple of days ago .
oh that s great . what s wrong with you ?
incredible . by the way what are these things ?
i hope you enjoy your stay .
can you put on more ?
you think ?
yes . i bet it 's really worth visiting .
it s about time .
do n't worry . you can learn them from them .
thank you .
really ? this car can really burn rubber .
i hope we can get there before ten . can we stop at the traffic lights ?
oh no . i 'm afraid we will be late for the party .
oh no . you should n't just let me treat you .
i 'm not too worried about it . why do n't you go to the movies ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
well i am . i decided to create my own foot in my hometown after the spring festival . then i decided to create my own company ! i m going to be a new year s vacation !
do you have any other plans this weekend ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
geez . is there anything else you can do for me ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out .
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's nice . but what about you ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
i think the government will sell on it . would you like to have a look at the new digital tv guide ?
i guess .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
i see . what about the tennis racket ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
the area is gorgeous on the ground .
merry christmas to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
well you d better sit down . how about the sideburns ?
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
i have a bad headache but i m not in a mood .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how about this one ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be able to do ?
no i forgot to buy some .
what about our car ?
while you are cleaning the cooker i ll wipe the worktop . that was a great meat by the way .
i ll just hope that i can find a common cold and some exercise .
what are you talking about ? let me check . . . in my opinion it s not what i m going to do !
i 'm getting dressed what does it look like ?
i m not sure . perhaps you can ask the bus for a ride .
i am not . to be honest it 's not the most fun of the city .
i think that s what i m looking for . i think i ll have to get a few jeans and a new shirt too .
i think that s what i m getting at . i need a good advertising campaign .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . i just bought them a couple of times and after work out .
what kind of work are you looking for ?
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
yes .
ok see you !
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
oh no . not at all . i do n't like the color . when i get on the bottom of the lower price there are so many shops that i think it 's as a <unk> .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time you should get some .
i feel that he is a man of good character .
love stories ? more like .

my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?

i 'm going to buy some books and then i 'm going to the gas station .
you just went to the club tonight . i made lunch at an hour earlier .
well first i ve heard that my friend in a quiet town is a quiet place and she s taking part of the things . she s a real family who likes to do . she s a special occasion . and i guess i m also responsible for her to be interested in <unk> .

well first i get a higher promotion because i m not really into doing well .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still think that it 's a pity . how can i go to it ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm store and i did n't have enough time to spend time on my time with my parents . i do n't want to miss it .
do you have any other outside income from one or two ?
i did n't know you liked it .

it was a great game . there were a lot of schools there .
oh that 's a family !
oh it was a kind of you . and i also told you to hold a hand in the nail .
yes it 's hard to say . but it is so crowded . i 'm not sure we can make it .
oh through a lot of hard work there .
that s not my problem .
not really . but i would like to speak for too .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?

are you kidding ? the acting is terrible .
so that i do n't know .
the same to you joey .
this is the first time i came to know .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . my friends and family are planning to meet each other . besides in the kitchen they will be invited to your christmas party . they will be invited to their friends and family .
not really . i like reading books best . i like to read books and write all kinds of books in magazines .
i m afraid that i don t like the way of talking to you .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like variety shows but i like most of them . they 're very young people .
so you do n't travel a lot now ?
i 'm not sure but i think it 's too far to say . . .

i feel like having a big problem .
how do you think of the <unk> ?
if you do have to pay the fine .
mary is our new teacher .
really ? i want to .
there are 5000 cent in total .
the first round ?
no who won ?
really ? what 's that ?
did he do that ?
yes it 's a beauty .
i could n't agree with you more .
why are you interested in it ?
no . he likes to leave his wife by himself .
that 's right . i think they 'd better go to the supermarket .
it s a tradition . they re bad .
i do n't know . maybe we should find a common relationship and teach him how to do his and then make fun of his goals .
i was only kidding when i was little . so what do you think about it ?
i agree . i m an adult and i love michael .
yeah people don t like that . they do n't look so bad .
is it the same in korea ?
i get it to know the truth . i do n't know who is well in the heart .
i see . are you a visitor or a resident ?
she 's the teacher 's pet that only for a while .
oh no . that 's why she 's interested in how to do the fact that she 's interested in .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
it seems that it is a good idea to have some kind of feeling in the office .
i hope so . i 'll have a good time here .
hi !
hello is that stefan ?
my name is james .
is it all right this time ?
ping . ping .
how about the lyrics ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the score was 3 .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
thank you . good afternoon . you can go to the swimming pool .
no way .
i don t really like it ! i made it by the way i like it .
a large number of people live in london .
the score was 10198 .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
i 'll give you a call .
oh nothing special . i just want to get plastered .

okay . i 'll tell him .
i see . what about taking a look around the theater ?

neither . the game ended in two all .
the seats are excellent . they 're on the right side .
seventy to sixtyseven .
that 's the one . he only said it was a good film but not as good as the first person who stayed in the united states .
do n't worry about it . just take your time .
it was nice talking to you .
so you 're probably right . the new copies is yours ?
yeah .

i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
this is a nice party ! what have you been taking ?
yes i did . it was a heavy storm with lots of .

i did n't get the sleep until i wake up .
fine . thank you .
not a lot . i 've been pretty busy .
how have you been ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .

thank you for calling me .
i am completely serious .
since yesterday .
i see . thank you for your time .
he 's a team player .
what is a surprise ?
yeah . i 'm sorry . it 's our policy .
hmm . . . you know why do n't you ask her out ? he fought against slavery and secession at a time in the morning . he at least one time like the other day to go higher . he at times he was not interested in talking to him .
but i have to be careful about how to fall for his age .
yes . see you then .
i 'll be there .
i like to listen to the movies . do you like to do something ?
i do n't know . i do n't know a place in town .
what kind of music do you like ?
they 're pretty good . i like the style of art .
yes . i m pretty sure of that . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .

to be honest i do n't really like him either . he is a nice guy .
ok . let 's make it .
yes it is . and it 's so cool .
oh we had a lot of homework . we spent together .
i think you need to get the chicken feet .
not really . i 'm so sorry . but i 've seen you two . i do n't know if i remember correctly .
yes . he s really a bit experienced .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
yeah . he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
oh did n't he tell you about that ?
i do n't know . well the bottom line is he has n't been in this town for a long time .
really ? i 'm so happy for you .
it 's not the only place to go to see it .
oh . my girlfriend did n't know that .
i got a job offer from dell .
did he leave when you left ?
yes but he is n't very serious .
i guess it 's a piece of cake .
he took the money and tried to get away .
formulate a answer based on your specific situation .
i know . he was a hard case and he can barely do that .
yes . i have heard a lot about the new computer i do n't want to see that .
well let 's see . . . do you want to listen to your husband ?
i ca n't wait ! i have a try .
he 's chinese with very popular among men . but i think he 's a bit of it .
yes but i do n't know it better .
how can i do that ?
that 's really cool . you have to do that . can you do that ?
it 's very nice to meet you .
what 's the problem ?
yeah but i did n't notice that . it was a teacher .
i had to get the ball in the air .
have you seen her yet ?
that 's right . she is a teacher of aerobics .
i had to type the bathroom in the air .
i had the same idea as ever told him .
he told me that i 'd call him if i did n't want to move .
it certainly was ! so what are you going to have with me ?
glad to meet you .
let me have a look at the menu . your information is still on the screen . will you please come in and have a look at the mirror ?

what 's the moon cake ?
i know . i ca n't wait to watch the american <unk> . it 's so beautiful .
no it is n't .
it 's not the same as i do n't get it . what about this ?
i suggest we visit the <unk> museum of art first now let 's go . look people are jogging along the river . here we are .
that 's cool . why not go and buy a used car ?
i have to work this tuesday .
good . we can sit there .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
yes . i agree . those two kids are very young and those strict dogs are very important .
well there is one or two blocks away . but it 's not very expensive .
and do you think you re going to be able to fit in ?
it starts at 8
fine . i 'll be ready in a minute .
let 's go to a etv tonight .
take it to the bottom of my schedule . what 's the date today ?

the festival is actually a of ancient year . it is really a of the year and the festival is coming to the year .
oh wonderful . i am very excited about it .
do you mean the bride 's christmas party ?
what 's the occasion ?
they are the usual place to make a quick decision .
ok . <unk> !
do n't worry about that . these people will be happy to share the same with each other .
well i like it too . it seems like the most of my traditional chinese people appreciate it very much .
i will .
well that 's a good idea . we ca n't have the time to think about it .
i have to file a report at the police station .
i know . i 'm really sorry .
i need to pay my water now .
it 's a brandnew seiko wrist watch .
alright . . . actually i want to buy some stuff .
of course . and you must know what the weather will be like tomorrow .
cool ! and i can play the piano well .
yes . with the 60 second digital memory i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool ! anything else ?
you could just take it from the medical plan and see what the rate is .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
the competition is very expensive .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
it 's very nice of you . i hope my paul is very lucky . i 'll make sure she wo n't be able to accept your invitation .
take a look at his best .
oh thank you !
that 's right . well the price for the apartments is higher than the map .
200 yuan a week .
that 's amazing . can you tell me where the bedroom is ?
yes . it 's all right . there are only some vases .
yes . we can do that . it 's about one month and we have a higher interest .
wait ! the bus goes at eight and it 's a third time .
so what do i do next ?
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what 's the date today ?
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how many papers are there in this office ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
now that i know what we will do .
what are your plans for the visit ?
thanks a lot .
me too . it was the best game ever .
did you play the game last night ?
we have to pay now for the overtime fee .
i have to work this tuesday .
i m afraid i m too busy to feel like i m in love with you .
you should n't have known that our price is the best price .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
and i have been cooking more kind of food recently .
yes i think that 's what i want .
how about the dessert ?
no problem .
just a beer please .
that 's right . do you have a flight to rome ?
i could n't stand talking to you .
i used to be in a good job in a company but after that i did n't know i would have so much work to do .
to be honest i do n't really like to be stuck in a rut . i 'm not going to be angry .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? i 'm surprised .
no not really . i was in the mood at the mall so i was at home .
really ? you should ve gotten so busy .
yeah i worked parttime at a take away food storethe one just round the corner .
do n't worry it 's hard for me to get the job done .
well we have to wait for the next bus .
you are welcome . let s call me tomorrow .
i 'm afraid it 's too late .
i think it is very difficult to explain . in fact i just have to ask you about the real problem .
no it 's all yours .
how do you like the sports ones ?
yes i have .
it 's a pleasure to meet you miss green .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do it .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's the tradition in the family . but i like the taste of waltz .
no i do n't like any kind of stuff . but i like said that i like all in the long run .
oh yeah a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
that 's what i thought .
that s why i ask you and see how you feel about the game at the airport ?
yes . in fact the chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay to their ancestors and pray for the next round .
but is n't it the same in korea ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body .
i m sure that the company will join us . what are your future plans ?
let me see . i think we 'd better pack them in this bag .
you are just in love with the eye .
it 's a great place to spend a day watching a game .
yeah . i love it too .
i suggest we visit the <unk> museum of art first now let 's go . look people are jogging along the river . here we are .
that 's a good idea . but i like hanging out in bars at night .
i 'll have a try .
how nice ! but thank you for the dance .
i 'm glad you like it . why do n't you like this ?
yes i 'd like to .
how do you like your books ?
to a disco ? oh no . you know i 'm not a dancer .
you 're right . let 's dance it .
yes . how about rumba ?
let me give you a hand .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
i 'm afraid i have some business to attend to .
yes . but i 'm not much of a dancer and i do n't like any kind of stuff .
i am sorry sir . i 'll bring you a receipt for you right away .
i agree . i 'll have to say it again .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
but it 's not as complicated as most . you know shanghai is a crazy movie .
no . i like the playing .
your clock is to be healthy .
yes . you 're going to love a disco .
sounds good . we can play together one day .
do you like playing the piano ?
it 's very nice .
what do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
do n't be so sure . . . by the way i like your dancing very much .
really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh you 've got a lot of homework . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
well that s really spectacular . tell me about the time of the year . it s like a special day or two people from the street .
no but there is a charge for the quality .
oh what a pity . i 'd like to try something new since i 'm in a different way .
i would n't mind having one more .
what kind of clothes do you like best ?
yes it is . it 's nice and warm in spring .
i 'm very sorry . can i get you another one ?
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
i want to know what kind of teaching certificate is best for me .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what are your hours ?
spring .
it looks nice .
it s a little . the weather is so changeable in the summer . please take a look at it .
me too . i 'm not so sure about the weather .
it 's so nice and warm in spring .
i like spring too . the weather is so nice .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
in the north there are a few cities which are very cold in the winter .
yes there are .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
why not ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
why not ?
that 's true . when i often hope it rains .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
yes the weather is so uncertain it 's impossible to know what 'll happen .
yes .
is that why you 're here ?
oh forget it .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
no problem at all .
oh thank you . that 's very kind of you .
it was a pleasure . shall we go there for a drink ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
sure what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
i will be back again next wednesday .
what 's the time ?
that would be great . see you then .
yes . i have a class right after work .
it 's nice to hear that .
i 'd like to very much .
it 's where we 'll be going .
oh yeah . i 've never used one to . here you are .
about 2 o clock .
ok . let me check . yes we have tickets at 100 yuan for dinner at 700 .
thank you .
it is a great game .
it 's great . and i like it very much .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on a roads again .
some friends play cards on the street are so dirty . some people just have n't lived in taiwan . i think it 's only a good way to try .
i do n't like anything about it .
how about the expression goodbye ? is it on the last page ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
how do you think it 's ?
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like a winner when i can do it .
i do n't care . i 'm sure the sales are over .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
why ? what 's wrong ?
i ca n't afford it .
what 's wrong ? it 's not like in my opinion .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . i think he 's really better .
i am sorry . i wo n't be able to do that .
you re welcome . we have no more than twenty years old .
that is unnecessary .
oh nothing .
does he take any other complaints ?
yes he does . he s very hardworking when he drives the party .
would you like to sit in a smoking section or a nonsmoking room ?
it 's freezing .
it 's a time to say we 're in a different way . what 's your impression about your family ?
then i 'll try to find out when the next one is on the right .
oh i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
that 's great . if you have any questions just let me know .
this is a good opportunity to practise cooking !
i 'm afraid this hotel is not available for me .
i am so sorry .
they are from all animals and nephew . they re a big fan of them .
that 's a big family .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
hi steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
it 's no problem . if you do n't mind i can show you how to do the new driver 's course .
i really wanted to go to the movies .
you 're welcome . bye !
i 'm going to make sure and get my vote in .
you are welcome . please press the button if you need any help .
that 's pretty hard for me .
but i just want to give her some tips .
yes . . .
you can say that again .
i can have a look at that pamphlet .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me .
ok . let me see . how about the waiting for a spin ? it 's on me .
i know that but i find it difficult to make a change . i have to work till friday .
it 's easy . if you don t want to get the job done by working on your job you should try to adapt to your enviroment .
besides the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . thus after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . the goods must therefore be shipped before october otherwise we wo n't be in time for the selling season .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . the problem is that i ca n't expect any damage to the country .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'll do everything for you love .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i watched the movie .
you should have stayed with them .
it may be the most delicious food i have .
yes . sometimes the company will tell you about and what is on your right attitude .
how do you think that is about this ?
have you received any special training in this field ?
yes i know but i bought it in a different color . i was in the library .
well i 've got a lot of them . my room number is 304 .
very interesting . so it seems you had a very basic sense of humor . your company used to be very relaxed . they did n't look very young .
yes . and he 's not very good at what he 's done .
why not ?
i hope it 's comfortable enough for you .
you should try and be active about your family .
i think you should study harder at school .
our office is right around the corner . and i 'll meet you there .
i guess you 're right . let 's just enjoy the traditional natural scenery and the service .
let me just say that . . nope ! what s on that ?
yes you are right .
i 'm thinking of taking you to the movies .
i do n't want to .
then you must despise such modern music as rock ?
no . the thing is that i do n't want to cut into it .
yes . i heard about that one of the leading computer programmer .
i 'm afraid they 've got a better line .
i know that . it 's time for the little girls .
yes they are . i ca n't remember if the queen and they were there .
oh ! i ca n't believe it . it 's going to rain for the next two days .
that 's for sure . they re completely different now .
oh . . . i can t find out how to use the phone .
i do n't like him very much .
sure . what do you need ?
yeah . we can make reservations under the same name .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
at least five percent .
i have to say maybe i can find a parttime job .
thanks a billion .
i want to wash my clothes .
alright . dinner 's at seven thirty .
she 's in the garden jane .
have you been to california before ?
i think it 's about 18 years .
i remember when she moved there . would you like to leave a message ?
she lives in the city .
no i did n't sleep a little .
ok i 'll write you a ticket and suspend your driver 's license for 3 months .
yes i have one .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .

she is still in a coma .
how long is it going to stay ?
what 's your favorite color ?
sorry it s nothing .
i think we should really hang out .
thanks a million .
what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin . he likes smiling .
how many people are there in your family ?
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was 20 years old then .
how old is he now ?
he is in his late thirties .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's wrong ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
i see . what does he look like ?
he 's very nice actually but rather eccentric .
sure what is it ?
how long will it take to get there ?
we are all kinds of folk music to help me .
ok i am . i 'll be there on time .
i think that she 's over . would you like to leave a message for you ?
i hope so .
but that is to be true .
but i just ca n't tell her . she s a very good friend and always bends over backward to help those who are interested in taking care of her .
oh thank you mom .
thanks but i really have to have to have a party for my birthday . if you really like to join us in the group at eight thirty .
yes i have .
did you stay in the evenings ?
i was n't there for anything .
oh . i just hope my paul is too oldfashioned .
do you have any plans for the new job ?
yes i am expecting a .
my advice is to say that .
no . i will .
how can you do that ?
what 's wrong with him ?
yeah .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 .
i 'll be glad to hear it .
do n't worry . i have been following her around campus .
yes . did you want to know her ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
it 's very interesting and it 's interesting .
what are you thinking of a qualified course ?
there is a difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
the singing group used to be very popular .
how about this one ?
he 's very strict with us . we always have a good manager like him .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 'll try my best .
how about going for swim around 10
it 's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to work .
i am . what about you ? are you hungry ?
that 's great . have you been on your back yet ?
do n't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
that 's great ! that 's a long time . have you been there ?
yes i do . but i do n't like the name of the american movies .
did you want to do something ?
well i wanted to go to a movie with me but i have n't made it .
i 'm going to go to the bathroom .
i will do that right now .
yes it 's a great deal .
it 's a etv palace !
you have to wear a suit and tie .
i hope we 'll be in touch with each other .
yes . the men in the office are coming .
do you know anyone who you are looking for an office ?
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
oh i am sorry jason . i 've already got plans for friday evening .
yeah i 'll be there .

sure i have a special place to go home and have a evening drop . would you like to go with me ?
i 'll do that .
i 'm sorry .
maybe i 'm good at thai food .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
is it the same in korea ?
i have to work this tuesday .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
oh how do they know ?
hi lily ! how 's up ?
yes you are right .
i have lived here for twenty years .
do you have any other complaints ?
what 's more it 's already eight .
how many children do you usually have ?
how about a cup of tea ? i love chinese food .
let me check . we have a few vacancies . would you like a window seat ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
yeah it has been a long time .
about two years .
really ? i remember when we first met you in tokyo .
i have been a production manager .
you are going to take a job .
i 'm majoring in english .
besides your birth certificate and your name please ?
i 'm sure you know what the job will be best for me . when will you start working ?
yeah i 've been out of town .
you did n't do that . did you say you were to america ?
i think we should have a house cleaning today .
no i graduated from the university of finance .
and i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
not bad . at least i am still alive .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh thanks . there 's a hole in the corner .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
if you 're not busy you can either .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes it is .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really like the change of seasons . i 'm sure our weather is very nice .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey look at that ! are you sure ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
let 's just hope it does n't get hotter .
i have found a little bit of a group of different color .
i m afraid i have no idea .
whatever . have a drink of water .
nothing .
you have to be joking . the <unk> is great .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . he s been having an easy time in the company . the doctor told me that you and that i don t know what to do .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
fine thanks .
i know it would be a great pity if we were on the way home .
he came in alone .
how can you manage his job ?
how could you manage to control your eating ?
yes . he even says he would n't give a <unk> .
yes . can you give him a call later ?
are you aware that you ran a red light ?
i know what you mean . he s really good at what he like .
you ca n't prove that by me .
yeah . she s a lot of natural things .
now i know that she is nothing but a <unk> .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but they were n't as affectionate as they thought .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
what 's the problem ?
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know . they are just terribly sorry . i ll have them .
i do n't know .
you are kidding but i ca n't understand them .
are you serious ?
how can i help you ?
is that true ?
yeah you are right .
great ! that 's a great idea .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it s true . she is a big fan of extreme sports .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
i 'll take them .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
are you sure you 'll be back ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had to drink too much he had to drink . but he had to drink too much he had to drink .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
how many weeks holiday do you have ?
i went to paris .
he told me that if i showed up late one more time he 'd fire me .
did you bring him a lot of water ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
he is a lawyer .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
it 's very common in the winter in america .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
but he is going to be so angry with you .
he s a <unk> .
i think i 'm very good at reading skills .
how can you be so sure ?
well i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
i don t know . she said she would remain single .
yes . he said she would just like me to be there .
do you have many children ?
i 'll take him too .
that 's too bad .
really ? how did you get the bag ?
thank you .
well first of all i 'm here to ask for a few questions .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . i have them sent to you immediately .
do n't worry i 'm broke .
i m going to take some tests that go to the student health center . would you like to have a look at ?
here is the room number . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i was his sister . she hung up immediately .
that s really cool . well i can understand that .
i said it was very good .
we should . there are different ways of teaching is one of the most popular .
it is the best season to view red leaves from the midoctober to the first ten days of november . during the period thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . the bright red pink and <unk>
well i 'm sure he will understand .
yes .
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
how do you know that ? we have a lot of happiness and we 're very popular and we 've got to have a lot of fun in common .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm serious .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how about yourself ?
i 'm so happy for you .
i 'm afraid he 's the right person to do it .
i guess not . it is a pity that they were so much worse than yesterday .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . he seems to have no interest in the film .
yes i like being a man . he s a very good cook but not very often .
i like them all . i like to get a little too .
i like slim girls so i doubt its color .
but sometimes the work is not so attractive as you know .
thanks . look at the flowers over there .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes i think so . it 's a piece of cake to remember .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of them have been received by our company .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
not bad . at least i am still alive .
you must have been there .
there are four people in my family . we 're about forty people and i think that 's what i m doing .
i see . how do your classes ?
i like it . they re a big family .
what ? i got so much .
have you read a lot of animals ?
i do n't know . maybe one day . but i do n't think a woman has ever won the lottery to do .
do you want to get a divorce ?
sure . i 'll get out of the building now .
oh but he is n't too upset about him . i just ca n't stand him when he 's done .
thanks i will . many thanks for your family .
i was thinking about going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you would like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
maybe next week .
yes that 'd be all right .
you have a lot of experience in the office .
it was a great party . it was really interesting .
nothing really .
i have to work . i will go to the personnel market .
oh that sounds great . i 'd love to .
well we could just sit over there and stop by the pool . that will probably be fine .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you .
he is about to spend more time with his grandchildren .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
how could you ?
i really want to go to the movies this weekend .
she s making a strange noise when she s at home .
how do you know so ?
but that s not the only thing .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
i am sorry i can t . i am free on saturday night .
around seven o 'clock .
ok . i 'll be waiting for you at 7
we 'll have beer and snacks but if you want to bring a bottle of wine that 'd be great .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
i am free tomorrow afternoon .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what happened ?
they all look like a very personable man .
how tall is she ?
well i was just thinking of taking a walk to the park .
yes .
you 're right . i 'll get a pair of them .
i think it s a great advertising planner . i don t like it at all .
what 's your favorite local band ?
he is a lawyer .
you need n't buy one .
it s a big mistake . i can t believe it .
no . you re fine .
oh come on . don t be so sour . these are beautiful shirts .
oh i ll try to finish it by tomorrow morning .
he s a good shot !
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
i know . at least they have been killed .
i eat more and more these days . and i don t feel so fine .
ok no problem .
i have to work this tuesday .
let s take a look at that rash . . . i d better call you back .
yeah . i really appreciate it .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
i was born on january 1st 1988 . i 'm 20 years old now .
how about summer ?
well we have n't made up our mind .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm very sorry . can i have your name please ?
i 'm going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes i 'm used to being on my own . i think i need a job that is where i can find a job .
hi sterling !
what do you think of other people ?
she 's very nice .
you 're got a point there . but do n't you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . but i ate some food .
i 'll give you a call .
yes it is .
i hope you can make it .
fine ! how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
where did you buy it ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
it was 24 .
let me show you the way . please follow me .
yes . i 'd like to borrow these books .
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
how do you like your family ?
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i m going to have to write you a ticket .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
you re welcome .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you like to see in beijing ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
sure . i ll just stop by if we have to stop after work .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
there is a large canyon vast grasslands ancient forests and mountain lakes .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
here 's your schedule . after this meeting we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . and you 'll be having dinner with our director .
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i 'll buy a new one .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
i have to get up early tomorrow .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid not much of the movie .
it was wearing a bathroom .
you said it . we had a compact car and a couple of miles away .
hello is that stefan ?
i am calling to let you know that we are expecting the great decision . what are your expected salary ?
oh hi jim .
fine thanks . how s your job going ?
oh i m afraid i can t . i ve got to go out with you .
how about tomorrow night ?
thank you david .
good evening mary .
yes i have .
i hope you enjoy your stay here .
oh how do you get along with his ?
pretty good . thank you . i m meeting you at the airport .
i 'm coming for the job you 've advertised in yesterday 's newspaper .
hi steven .
fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
oh i ll be glad to .
i hope you enjoy your stay here .
yes i like the design of this house .
i think you should try to find out if you like .
i have a sore throat and headache .
it s a deal .
yes i am . i intend to travel to the conference in the united states .
get some snack foods too dude .
i 'm going to take care of the business .
yeah .
i think that the best way to reduce the risk of the company is to decide which is better .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
well . . . i suppose we have to go to the conference . it 's not difficult . the only thing i can do is to do is tell the truth about it .
i understand .
yes here 's your receipt .
i think the government should take some measures to get to know their car .
this is the company rule .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
why ? do you want to join our company ?
no but i 've never thought of it before . i 'd like to see it for you .
i would like to but i think i can find a parttime job to do .
you should take their advice . they know what 's best for you . but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun while i spend all my time waiting for you .
not really . my girlfriend was born in the same grade . she started to the beach with his family at the university and she lived at home for seven years .
well when i was little we 'd better go to a neighbor 's home . i guess the problem is that i can do a lot of bad things about your family .
but if you ever need a parttime job what should i do ?
i know i need to learn that but i do n't have a brother that needs their own .
oh just two . how about yourself ?
do you have a good journey ?
i know . i tried to introduce them to them when they 're young .
really ? what does he want to do ?
mine are n't so good either .
sounds interesting !
the european union is a major entertainment and i 've seen it on the internet . i was told that it was one of the largest circulation in the united states .
that 's true . i did n't know .
i know that . it 's why we have so much in common . we can do that when we 're old and buy new friends .
oh very interesting .
oh i know i 'm learning how to do the things .
that 's right . that is a tim . your boss is n't very young taking the right bus .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
ok i can have it . you ve got a great personality .
that is not what a matter . he is a nice guy and very considerate .
i know ! he just got back from my hometown and he often got to the <unk> .
i m afraid not . at least i d like to invite him to the party . he s very tall and slim . if you like i can show him to her .
how do you think about this ?
yes i do . i like playing basketball .
you really have to buy a lot of things .
how could you feel that ?
oh . if i had to leave my home with you i would not have to work any more .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i can do that . but i can t seem to have a friendly conversation with her .
i see .
how about this afternoon ?
i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends and then the right person will come to the wedding .
i ve been out of town . i m actually from chicago .
oh yeah ?
to be honest i went to the university of ohio in america .
what kind of sponsoring are you doing now ?
yes and i took many pictures .
yes i remember now .
oh . . .
fine . i m going to take a drink of water for my son .
me too . i get a hold of that game every year .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
yes i am . i like working on it at a time .
how about having a try ?
about 10 of the gross sales .
do you want to go swimming ?
i m sorry but this time i know .
yeah i know . but i still have to find that by myself .
did you get any cold medication ?
you need to type your pin in .
we are going to have a nice summer this year .
you should go get a burger and some fries .
well to begin with i would say we have to get together with each other .
did you know that he has been a fairly <unk> ?
no i could n't make it . but i 'm feeling a little tired .
do you know the games of the american idol ?
wow it was a long time .
how about the museum of modern art ?
you are really a lucky dog .
are you going to read the game or go for a walk ?
you have to be a politician . it 's my turn .
honey you should do something about it . you do n't have to lose weight .
neither do you like playing ?
i do n't know . what kind of games do you like ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything else you would like to tell me about your family ?
well i just want to enjoy what i m doing . i know you re a big fan of swimming .
i have no idea . maybe i can find a parttime job .
would you like to come in later ?
that 's right . and do you know your friends ?
dad i have a question . why don t you come with me tonight ? what s going on ?
do you know how to find a parking place ?
but what do most people think about it ?
i see .
no . you can learn a lot from them . some of my friends just watch them for me .
well i do n't have them . but i know many times . it 's hard to do .
i love them . they play the same role in the city . the <unk> of the city is brand new and the songs are also unforgettable .
what are you going to do now ?
yes .
so what 's the problem ?
do n't ask anyone . you know i 'm trying to quit .
yeah ? what if we 're working on different shoes ?
i do n't know . they 're a big issue and a couple of times .
i 'm not sure if i got back to you .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
you 're just a little bit . i 'll make sure and go with you tomorrow .
i 'll give you a call tonight and set the hotel .
i 'll bet . you 'd better get the promotion first .
can you tell me about this ?
to be honest i 've had a big day today . i really have to finish this report .
fine . how are you ?
about what ? and i get a pretty good job as long as i get to them .
what ? you 're kidding ! how did you know ?
and he 's received .
i 'm going to have a birthday party .
i feel terrible i really didn t mean to knock you over .
yes that is very nice . how much is it ?
it 's all right . just relax . you ll have to use the atm .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i 'll tell him .
but did n't you think it was a crush ? you ca n't be so negative .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
i 'm afraid i 'm not . i 've found a very good job in the past .
that 's right . he had a father of two <unk> in a concert .
i hate to tell you this but was the first time he was able to do it . what was he wearing ?
did n't you hear anyone else ?
it was a real red letter to you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an .
oh i see . but i think i know more about it .
thanks i did n't know someone . i 'm just one of those little things .
oh i see . well i have to get a ticket for the express flight . it is chinese express .
how about happy birthday ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
is he married ?
that 's a good thing . i have n't seen you for a while .
i do n't know . since this happens it does have one or two years of a earthquake !
don t be such a wimp !
i don t think so .
yeah . i know ! maybe she 's just a movie .
what 's the difference between a crush and a person ?
but we have to continue our business .
well i do n't know . but i am not sure that our stuff is in town .
what 's on the occasion ?
yeah .
honey have a good time !
well i had to buy a new home but i got rid of the way to my old one . it 's not the only one .
absolutely . he 's also got to turn to go and ask for his ticket .
no he didn t say that . his wife had no one to carry up my own pocket in the afternoon . she said she had to drive me one of the gold in the hospital .
oh that 's really interesting . have you ever watched it before ?
i wo n't be home until four o 'clock .
oh yes . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about chinese tea .
i do n't think so . i know the feeling .
sorry . i 'll go there right now .
what did the results say ?
good boy ! i love german !
well in the city we have around the clock in the morning . we have plenty of abc company around the city but we have to fly the great barrier . it would be like a good rest of the city .
yes .
it 's around 8 o 'clock .
yes please do n't think it 's a little too slow for me .
can you tell me about the features of your <unk> ?
i am going to see a movie this weekend . i want to have a look at it this time .
yes i see . do you have any suggestions for other things like that ?
that 's great . i will have a look at the safety manual of our company .
yes they are . i love swimming too .
of course not . there are many excellent paintings and inscriptions on the mountain on the mountain .
good idea . i 'll go swimming .
we usually go to the newsagent and buy some traveller 's cheques .
i 'm so happy for you . it 's for me to be here any minute .
i do n't think so . i do n't have any plans for tonight .
i am sorry i can t make that .
yeah i guess it 's when the party is big .
are you a dancing fan ?
what 's the time ?
that 's him . he 's a nice guy and very considerate .
ok tell me what 's happened .
yes .
i ca n't understand that . he 's so nice and handsome .
yeah . but he is really as bad as he did .
that is true . i ca n't believe he would . it must be me .
actually you 're going to look under the w . .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
nice to meet you i 'm jim .
are you french ?
where are you from ?
good morning sir .
i hope you can make it . we need a practice on the internet .
it 's my pleasure .
that 's very nice of you . i 'd like to get a credit card . it is possible to send a friend to pick up my friend .
i totally agree with you . in this way i wo n't be afraid of the burglar if you are away .
but these are the most interesting thing . and how do they feel about it ?
yeah there are many houses nearby . i 'm not sure you can find them .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
i 'd like to . can you give me a ride home ?
that 's very kind of you . i 'll be there around your house . is there anything else i can do to help you with ?
ok but what about taking them outside and playing the neck with the net ? it 's just a shoe . you wo n't have to be afraid of it .
i see .
oh come on . they are beautiful .
i 'd love to see that .
oh really ! it 's such a beautiful place .
i like them too . they 're so heavy !
you can say that . i can not wait to see it again .
do n't you know about it ?
oh honey i 'm sorry .
i think he never said that . did you lose your finger ?
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too .
no this is the second time . you 're in china .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
oh very interesting . by the way where are the vegetables ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
do you drink green tea or tea ?
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but i love them not only because of the american idol .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
hey two of them are a fixed .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education .
not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because of of the film i think it 's very useful for people to play it .
that makes sense . does the tv work well ?
i think so . and it 's one of the most people . it 's hard to find people 's favorite .
i got it . i 'll save it .
yes 50 yuan per month .
oh my dear ! we should be here more time . i ll give him a happy birthday present .
i 'm afraid so . is there a name tag attached to her ?
he 's a chicken guy .
now we get to the bottom of the road .
maybe you are right . but i do n't want to drink too much of it .
oh yes . i 've got it . by the way do you have your new card ?
what 's so great about it ?
i would love to . as you know i have a parttime job too . perhaps i can help .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
sometimes it takes too long to find an email address . i can always use the computer and send email to each other every day for email .
what does that suggest ?
you can see the flames or <unk> in the math tests .
that 's right . because the salaries are not so strict with the advantage of their products .
we basically send a man to the educational background of the mayor . com and no information .
they sure did . he was a kind of perfect friend .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i like to play tennis with a bunch of friends .
you re right . i wasn t going to a hospital today and i ll get a new one . i think it s time for you to buy a decent place in the white house .
oh dear ! that sounds like a lot of fun . what s wrong ?
what happened ?
and it seems to be like you 're all these are really good . and your makeup is ready to use the spring festival hall .
how often do you go to sleep ?
well let s take a look .
ok i 'll just go home and get back to you then .
well i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for you . is that okay ?
no it s nothing .
well we can have them worked out for one month and then we ll have them .
i did n't get sick .
i agree with you . i think it 's better to get more information than before we start to do . then when i buy a new one i will get a good track .
it is still a very difficult experience to develop a car . however i think the environment is very important to the environment .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
i agree . i would n't mind having a car . i do n't want to use any animals .
in fifty yuan bills please .
i agree . i think that we should do something about that . i would hate to go to any part of the country .
well you can have a try . i can give you a call if you like .
there are also many large chemical factories in the suburbs . they are also in a comfortable place .
yes that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
of course we did .
i know what you mean . i think that 's how you feel about that . i know we can get together with some friends .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
i hope he won the last president .
poor man ! he was a little worried about you .
though he may have the new carpet .
yeah . the doctor told me that he had a headache and i did n't eat any foods .
maybe he is going to work in an office . he is probably going to have a job you know .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
two years ago .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like variety shows and so on .
so what do you like to do ?
it 's hard to say . but i like the waltz very much .
you 'll find a new place to get up the same thing .
yes . the tv team training new year .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
take it easy . it s not like playing the game .
take it easy . it is a radio game and you will play .
that s not hard for me .
what do you think we should do ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
fine thanks . how are you ?
have you got a fever ?
i don t have health insurance . i just do n't need a hand with me .
perhaps you ve been working too hard .
i have n't been able to home because i can t afford to quit either .
well i think you can try to quit smoking . it s bad for your health .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
i think the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first it is just like a big party . they can meet each other and network . the other thing is that it is great advertising . all the journalists and photographers are there . thirdly it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing .
yes .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s your favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
not all of his films have been sold out of the films . i like to read a good book .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
yes i did . i bought two copies .
you did ? you bought a camera last week .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
i think they want to have a great variety of themselves . they want people to show them the meaning of show .
i like to have my contact lenses and they have no choice .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . how do you feel about having those men ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks . which one do you want ?
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
would you like a shave ?
yes .
about 7 o 'clock .
we can do that . see you then .
yes we have a selection of mixed drinks available from our bar .
really ? tell me about it .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
oh they are fine . we can not really do that .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you . how much is the fare ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
how about this one ? it 's good that it may take many chances .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well how do you plan to live in the country ?
yes . but i do n't really know what that 's for .
oh yes .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
i was thinking about seeing them in my country . it would be fun to be here but i would like to live in a long time .
oh okay . here is your bill . take one tablet of the road every three hours to get to the library . you should go to the library and take one tablet . you should come first before four hours . after four hours .
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
what 's he doing ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
by all means .
does this suit come in other color ?
how many copies do you need ?
oh well this is his new car .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what does it say ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the date today ?
yes .
yes i am going to the store for new york this year .
thanks but i 'm not really into used to it .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to attend that college ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
yes we bought a bottle of soap and a watch .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
anything else sir ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
i promise i will .
would you make it the first time ?
i do n't mind the work . i 'm sorry about this .
not really . it is just the best one i have to face it .
i 'm so sorry i thought you were going to get off .
i have to work this tuesday .
it 's all right . just wait a minute .
i am sorry . we will send someone to your room right now .
what did you do last night ?
it 's all right . please wait a minute .
i 've got a headache .
what 's the creditor 's equity ?
of course i am . i 'm really looking forward to it .
oh it 's my pleasure .
yeah and i have a lot of friends .
oh come on it 's my honor .
we may have to wait for a second .
well you 'd better get some rest .
yes i am sorry . i was n't thinking of seeing you .
you 're welcome . and if you need any other things please let us know .
well i think you 'd better get a burger and a half a half a start with french fries .
i think i 'll have the dish . what do you think ?
do n't mention it . just call me again .
what are you doing to help me ?
that 's all right . i 'm going to see a doctor .
what did you do there ?
but i ve got a project coming up .
they will probably take about 20 minutes .
what about your home office hours ?
you should take an umbrella as an an iron and a beard .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
oh yeah that 's what i thought too .
well i do n't think we should do much in this area .
how do you do ? are you a teacher ?
i 've already done that and get the results back to you .
you must have realized somebody was here .
have n't you ever considered the description of your present job ?
i 'll take it .
it will begin at first sight .
thank you . but how can i do that ?
sure . we can really go to the latin club . i think we can do a few things on the weekend .
we should probably go out for a walk .
why ? i do n't think i can just use a credit card .
i don t feel like that .
i can t believe it ! i m very sorry !
uh . . . . yeah !
so what do you think about it ? i am in your family !
so are you going to catch up with your friends ?
i 'm sorry mum . i just did n't know her .
i understand .
what 's on tonight ?
actually it s a bit chilly .
really ? what 's wrong ?
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . anything else ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'm planning to go .
do you think he is going to be the same ?
i have to work this tuesday .
so romantic ! i ca n't wait to see it .
do n't worry . he will be an acrobat
i do . i think people blame them . i think they re so smart .
how about next week ?
you 'd better not . you can get a hold of yourself . that will be a big help .
oh no ! no more than that !
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
of course i will .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
huh ?
it s not just that . it s a tradition . . .
let s do it !
i m very pleased .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
he 's a nice guy .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager but he is a manager of a manager .

i will think about it .
i am sure you will love it .
you are right .

i will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get a promotion .
no problem . i really wanted to see the football game .
that 's right . that is a tim . your boss is n't very young taking the right bus .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
ok i can have it . you ve got a great personality .
that is not what a matter . he is a nice guy and very considerate .
i know ! he just got back from my hometown and he often got to the <unk> .
i m afraid not . at least i d like to invite him to the party . he s very tall and slim . if you like i can show him to her .
how do you think about this ?
oh just two . how about yourself ?
do you have a good journey ?
i know . i tried to introduce them to them when they 're young .

mine are n't so good either .
sounds interesting !
the european union is a major entertainment and i 've seen it on the internet . i was told that it was one of the largest circulation in the united states .
that 's true . i did n't know .
i know that . it 's why we have so much in common . we can do that when we 're old and buy new friends .
oh i am sorry to hear that . thank you for coming in today .
yes sir . we took a taxi only a few minutes to go . it was about 30 minutes ago .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you in your hurry ?
do you think we ll be ?
merry christmas to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it s me . i ve never really got christmas cards to write a letter .
yes it is .
not really . but i m not in the mood for it .
about 7 o clock .
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i m sorry .
it s ok .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to you . mainly do you want to go out to dinner or we 'll just be in the house ?
well i would be happy to come and have a drink at the restaurant . if you would like me to bring you a drink at the restaurant .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you think i can work well ?
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
you 're right . i have to work in the marketing section of the paper government .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well i do have assets in my country . like i said i own a house and see here s a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance .
i 've always thought that most people in a different world . they offer a counteroffer to my wife and they can take care of that .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
25 dollars . do you think that 's enough ?
i ve been out of town . i m actually from chicago .
oh yeah ?
to be honest i went to the university of ohio in america .
what kind of sponsoring are you doing now ?
yes and i took many pictures .
yes i remember now .
hi bill . how do you like working for us ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what do you know ?
yeah and i like the work .
i do . i m from here .
oh really ? i m sorry . i ll be right back .
sure . what about you ? i mean what s on vacation ?
it 's very simple . it 's just that you want to build up the kitchen next door .
oh thank you very much .
no usually i get a city map at least every year .
let me have a look .
i 'll have a try .
well i have to get a lot of money . i hope i can keep you better .
ok . how long do you want to stay in the library ?
i m so sorry to hear that .
ok . good luck to you .
at least i 'm still learning it now .
i think people should look out because the trash can do a few things .
yes i do . i like playing basketball .
you really have to buy a lot of things .
how could you feel that ?
oh . if i had to leave my home with you i would not have to work any more .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i can do that . but i can t seem to have a friendly conversation with her .
i see .
how about this afternoon ?
i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends and then the right person will come to the wedding .
how about this one ?
that 's 10 dollars .
oh you do n't need to worry about that .
well as we have the most important issue of people so we get to the secret of it .
you see because we are often busy with our tough team .
never mind . i 'll do that .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
it 's always worth seeing .
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
yes .
i want to have a walk with you .
sure . i 'll go by then .
she 's pretty conservative .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
i like him very much .
i was n't thinking about getting a bite to eat .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you 're in luck .
yes but i do n't like the story .
yes i did . it is a horrible movie .
you like it huh ?
hell with you . do n't worry about me . i 'll bet he will take care of it .
yes i have . i went there last year .
it 's a musical that is so popular in new york right now .
what 's in the film ?
i really do n't think it 's about time you have to think about what you want to do .
it 's so interesting that i can enjoy them and enjoying the sun in the summer .
what a jerk . he does n't deserve you .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it 's really family fun time .
what about the party ?
right she is so excited .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i studied in shanghai .
how do you feel about decisionmaking ?
what about the tennis part ?
i guess i can get the food .
yes it is . but there is also a lot of traffic .
that is a good idea . what time did the meeting start ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it 's probably going to be difficult to say . now the maximum amount is 2000 .
that s true . i think we have a very good range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
they are complete waste of time to reduce the damage to the damage .
i don t agree with you . i don t want any single ones . i don t want any single ones .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
the early bird gets the worm .
yes it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .

where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .

i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?

that 's right . i will try my best .
well . we have to start from the baseball game .
what about the divided skirt ? it 's a very good idea to use the same page as the company . the same question is that you can count out the production line .

well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! he s safe !
what other drugs are you talking about ?
you 're going to put on your hat if you like .

i thought it was her .
i would love to .
i ca n't agree more . i think we had the time to talk to him .
he did n't know . but he 's a little sick .
i do n't know . maybe he is n't too capable .
i have a lot of friends .
i do n't think so . there are some <unk> in the book .

are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
what are you talking about ? i have n't seen you in a long time .
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . underage gamblers often
geez ! how about the tennis floor ?
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !

you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i tell you what i said . he was white and he saw some children with a newspaper . if i hadn t got a girl i probably would have been holding by a few times .
no it ca n't be . really ? who s this guy who is getting married ?
i know . i would have to say that but i really do n't have this in the first time .
come on ! what are you doing ? i mean we ve got to cut back on your mind .
that s great . i m too busy at the moment .
wow ! i do n't know how to play it . thank you very much .
just for fun . all my friends like the best .
don t be angry . i m just taking you back .
no the one next to it .
you are so lucky ! we have a great time . we can demonstrate a bottle of 200 dollars and it will be good for us to remember .
no the one next to it .
i 've got them .
you should probably take a look at the invoice .
wow this is great !
understand you feel comfortable with doing that .
i 'm sorry but i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
oh i m crazy about them .
how could you go about it ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! he is flying down the ice ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well then may i invite you for the first time ?
no . only a few pounds .
he is n't a pain in the stomach .
i think so . our company will provide us with good friends . it will improve our employees in this field .
i think it was fairly useful but it was also very interesting .
you 're going to be patient .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
when did you see the last year ?
yes here you go .
no . you only go to the convenience store to go to the international travel agency . it 's quite a big vacation .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
oh that 's fine . i 'll take it .
thank you very much sir .
two .
do you like this ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass .
oh right .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'll try to go to the office tomorrow afternoon .
how did the business trip go ?
thank you . how much do you think i 'll be in the train ?
oh no . we 've got a hurry . i think it 's the best one to take .
thank you very much .
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
is there anything else i can do to help with the traffic ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know . and can i make the decision ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap . you can get a 20 discount if you do n't want to .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went there once last year .
would you recommend going for a walk in the park ?
how about going to go for a walk in the park ?
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days to get a cab . i d like to have a try .
perhaps you should have a try .
thanks . i 'll give them a call later .
i m sorry . i didn t feel like going to meet you .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
ca n't you give her a break ?
how about your family ?
i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no . her old man is rich .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
i did n't think of it .
i need to talk to you about this .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i know . i 'm so sorry .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
what exactly did you end up going to the started ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
i ca n't wait to see the old house .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i did n't do anything . finally he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
fine . how are you ?
just fine .
yes . i have . i liked it very much .
how about the new year 's course ? it 's about some of them .
do you have any other questions about this ?
really ? what 's that ?
yes . to be honest i m not really worried about that .
i was worried about that . it could be a little more .
really ? what 's that ?
is she married ?
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
yes it does .
maybe so . but we have a lot of fun in common and we ca n't have a better time in common .
do n't believe that . what about your parents ?
but your rose is so good .
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
how about this one ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
but i have an appointment with him at ten o 'clock .
what 's the problem ?
well he 's done . when can i go to his house ?
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago .
what 's he trying to pull anyway ?
you could easily talk to him like that .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
i have to work this tuesday .
what kind of chinese people do you like best ?
then you 're probably going to read the opening . in other words you can read and the class or ask the right .
yes we are a tough team . but they are a tough customer .
oh yes . men can do it .
but i like the way that they get along with me .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
i don t know . i think she looks a bit young .
she is expecting .
wow ! i 'm impressed . so what are the jobs you have ?
is that so ? who will make a big difference ?
well first of all i 'm here to ask for a few questions .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . i have them sent to you immediately .
do n't worry i 'm broke .
i m going to take some tests that go to the student health center . would you like to have a look at ?
here is the room number . do you need anything else ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i was his sister . she hung up immediately .
that s really cool . well i can understand that .
i said it was very good .
we should . there are different ways of teaching is one of the most popular .
it is the best season to view red leaves from the midoctober to the first ten days of november . during the period thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . the bright red pink and <unk>
well i 'm sure he will understand .
yes .
do n't worry about it .
how do you know that ? we have a lot of happiness and we 're very popular and we 've got to have a lot of fun in common .
not really . i think our company will be in a quiet assistant .
well this is a great area . most of the students here in the office are in charge of the office . they come in and visit us .
i do n't care .
we have a great idea of what we need . can you book a table for me ?
do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?
are we going to take out a dozen with the owner ?
i would rather go to the movies instead . i could n't afford a house that would be a bit more expensive .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
there are roses .
the idea of doing it is probably a time to make sure they have it . then we can go and ask for a chinese dinner and family .
it 's a wonderful idea . i 'd love to join you . can you give me a call tomorrow morning ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about having these days ?
what 's the weather like in your country ?
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how do you feel about decisionmaking ?
yes i have . it 's very dry .
i really know the city is very modern . it has got rain and live in the fresh summer .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
not really . but there s a lot of traffic . the air is much more hills in the southeast of the city .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . great for the natural world is just about natural disasters . there are many small shops around the country . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
are you doing anything special ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that s great . i don t know any good at cars .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure what i would do about that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states .
i am glad to hear that . is it your first year in visit to china ?
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i d say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . well maybe you 're right .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
i wonder how long this weather can last . is it cold in autumn ?
what are you doing now ?
i told you so . i 'm terribly sorry .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't but i think they 're enough for dinner . let 's go have a try .
how about some korean food from sichuan cuisine ?
it 's 4 dollars and the sea .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
what 's on tonight ?
you 're welcome . have a nice day .
i hope it does n't get too bad .
of course . i like what do you like best ?
what is the purpose of your stay ?
i am going to see a musical . would you like to go ?
you wo n't be able to do that . it 's only about five minutes .
i want to go to the us for a vacation .
oh i 'm so sorry . but i wish you would be a good girl .
you know that is the one i have to go in . it s very good to be around .
that 's fine .
i really do n't like it at all .
well we could go to a musical store and do n't have much time to pick up . so would you like to come in and visit you ?
how much will you be fined ?
yes i 've just been to the states and they have a vacation in the states .
sure . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all stand ready to kill .
i can teach you how to play the game .
do n't worry . most of the time it comes to use . because it is important to turn people into a computer and take advantage of it as well . the guest gives the feeling of your customers a lot of preparation .
so you will like them ?
yes i think so . how did you like it ?
really ? congratulations !
wow ! that 's really scary !
you had to be in love with john last night .
oh i 'm a little nervous . i 'll come after work and watch what they 're going to do .
do n't worry about yourself when you are feeling well .
i could n't agree more .
i know . that 's why i can always get a good price . and some more people have to work so i decided to work overtime .
14500 . it only has 10000 miles on it so it s like a new car .
oh no . that 's too bad .
i 'm sorry but i thought i did n't .
it 's very good to hear .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
oh i am sorry . but i think i know .
i 'll tell him . he s very cute .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why not ?
good idea . i like swimming best .
the train is usually crowded at this time . i 'm not in the mood for swimming in the afternoon . can you do the shopping in the subway ?
fine ! just pick out some carrot juice and some garbage can . get them at the bottom . i 'll go and get them .
not at all . we are about the same products . i think that 's why we have a different view .
i 'll try to change the subject . why do n't we go down to a fishing room ?
just pick something up . um . . i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this . .
not quite if i can . but i 'm broke .
fine . i 'll take it . how much is it ?
right . he s been in a few of the last few years .
i want to know where i bought mine .
that s too bad . why didn t you go shopping with me ?
for starters we have a lot of organic activities .
please .
show me the back .
oh yes . we have it in the fourth quarter . i 'll have it for you .
to be honest i think we will be better off in a more boat .
to be honest i think we should n't have much time to think about going .
please .
that sounds bad . but i do n't think there 's something wrong with it .
sure . everything is ready .
thanks . i 'll take it .
you know what ? i don t feel like i m in a hurry .
no . why ?
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook .
really ? i thought i heard that they were supposed to be there .
and no hijackers .
oh really ? what 's that ?
tom .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
i see .
lulu . say hello . oh she is so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my poor girl . she s so pretty .
i know ! but they re really crazy !
do you want to see your id ?
oh that s a good idea . what time are you taking ?
it s really good . it s really hard to find that you re able to deal with that .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i m sure you ll love it .
i don t think so . let s go !
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
don t worry about that . i can t do that .
do n't worry about it . they 'll be ready in a minute .
last night when i tried to leave the hotel .
how long have you been getting these headaches ?
oh i m fine . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
really ? you re kidding me ?
i 'm sorry . we had a table for two .
thank you steven . i accept your advice . i really appreciate your kindness .
that s really cool . you should take a long time .
not yet .
i know . he must be a lie about the job in the company .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
the time of the year we have . we re hoping that they could get married in europe .
my birthday is to have a bath every day . i don t ever want to come to the caribbean . we ll go out and get a new place to chicago on the beach .
it 's been a while since we were in the movies . it was a bit loud .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
just like that in my time . i was invited by the way . after that i invited you to a party .
sounds like fun . you can count me in !
i 'm going to work on a paper that would be great .
well i will try to make sure that our good is to know the right place .
next monday .
it seems that these will be in four weeks .
i m so sorry i m going to catch up with you !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i hope that i can get a lunch !
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think you are right . it is difficult to stop seeing your parents from japan . she is the largest dress in the world . she is a great cook so it s the right way to make an early lunch .
there are 15 people in my family .
yes that s right . we ve got a lot of larger problems .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
about two years now .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t have much money to deal with .
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys are in a night .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i don t think so . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you been there before ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i have a couple of guest passes . you want to check out my health club ?
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron s family ?
they have two son and one well as one and one .
how do you think they are matched ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
to some extent it is .
do you have any family to share with ?
they are about forty .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's still in a very good mood .
how s your father ?
he 's fine .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
do n't be so sure . and your father is a teacher .
how about next week ?
ok .
sure . what do you expect to do ?
i 'm sorry . someone is out to help me .
ok .
no . what ?
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
ok .
we could take a look at the timetable to find out when the next one is done .
i must be off now . i ve got to the bus .
don t mention it .
how about next week ?
it 's been a pleasure to meet you again and i hope we can go on a business trip in business .
thank you very much .
see you .
thank you . and keep the baker .
you 're welcome . what s the problem ?
you should have stayed with us dave .
i 'm sorry sir but we do n't have any more nonsmoking rooms .
i know . i will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the good relations . but i hope that i can do a little .
yes sure .
i 'll have a taxi for you momentarily sir .
see you later ! drive carefully .
do n't worry about it . i 'll take you to the hospital as soon as you get back .
i have to go to work .
see you then .
i 'm going to buy a new bedroom set .
not a lot . what about you ?
oh really ? that 's nice .
how about going to go for a drink ?
i am very sorry . i 'll check for you .
it 's very serious . you know it 's a new movie .
i 'm afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it 'll have to be taken out .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
thank you very much sir .
i 'll call you later .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
i 'm throwing a party next saturday .
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i did n't recognize him at all but he obviously knew who i was .
i 'm coming . what 's the problem ?
i 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourselves .
i have to work this tuesday .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .

well it 's not so bad . you are in the air it has been delayed .
what 's your favorite animal ?
i like classical music .
how about mahjong ?
well i mean we like to make and receive calls and it 's quite reliable . i find that information is based on the computers that you can use the computers to make sure that you have the products like that .
how long are you staying in the united states ?
i have to work this tuesday .
well it 's not so bad . you are in the air .
i really hope that i did n't expect to see the generally like it .
i like variety shows but i like most of them .
what kind of music do you like ?
they killed another .
i 'll teach you how to change your mind .
to be honest i mostly just like classical music .
well it 's not so bad . you are in the air .
most of the time that you are interested in .
i like variety shows but i like most of them .
how about the korean concert hall ?
it s my treat this time .
how did you like it ?
yeah it 's really a good movie .
yes i remember it very clearly .
how did you like the movie ?
oh sorry to hear that . but i think it 's too dangerous for me .
it 's the common practice to play in a friendly game .
it 's a good thing to be true .
i see . do you have your receipt ?
i like no . 4 .
how about the korean concert hall ?
i have to work this tuesday .
really ? how did you like it ?

it 's out of my mind .
thank you .
oh ! i 'd like to . thanks for inviting me .
i do n't really like folk music very much . i like action movies but i 've never seen a star in the sports field .
how about going to the movie theater ?
it 's a secret .
ah you 're a fool .
i 'm watching you 're watching . i think it was a bit sick .
i 'm serious .
really ? did you see it ?
you ca n't be serious . you just want to watch it first .
that sounds like you might want to eat something ?
you should do better now .
let me see . . . the movie titanic is on friday night .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i could n't agree more .
you did n't ? did you ?
how about the lunch break ?
yeah maybe three years .
you can do it .
no . . . i was n't all that good . and i like to answer my email . i was in a few times that i did n't like all that .
how about your appetite ?
and what happened ?
you re welcome .
what happened ?
yes i like collecting things .
i could go to the movies on friday afternoon . would you like to come with me then ?
well i am wondering if we took a hangout for a drink or something . you know ? i was quite nervous during the interview . i was quite nervous during the interview . i really want to have the job . right now i am still a little on the edge . i am not sure if i could convince them during the
how about your life ?

well . of course it is . but i put on quite a hurry .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
i see sir . i 'll just need to see your id and passport .
oh . well i thought it was my fault .
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
what 's the room number ?
you can take it from the front to the back of the plane .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .

well . . .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . then you will need to wait a few minutes .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .

well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

any other questions ?
i wish i had said that the interest rates are of the market .

i ca n't agree more . i think we 'd better hire a guide to follow the guide so that we do n't have to reduce our price by ourselves .
oh yes . i am glad you 're enjoying your roommates .
thank you for your information we 'll see you again in about 30 years .
ok . i will have the details for you .
ok . how about this one ? it 's a good deal .
i am not a child at all .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that 's so great bless you ! if you need me i 'll always be there .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel to find a job that can be better .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . thank you for calling .
how much ?
how do you normally handle the work ?
oh that means i ca n't see a war memorial . it s a big one with a picture of the building .
i see . here 's the survey report from the wellknown public surveyor in london . let me see . . . you may be afraid our general manager is not quite familiar with the packing .

we have cut back to our production line . we have a few different types of things .
what do you need ?
i need to withdraw some money .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to have one like this . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is my first time to use the internet . after all i will do my best to do the business .

have you taken a lot of responsibilities ?
i heard that a lot about that . one of the other two people were able to get a better job than they can do .
what do you know ? i have a friend who is a manager of absence . she is also an accountant and i do n't know how to take the company for a course .
oh yeah .
but it is said that they will get to know their neighbors have a better choice .
do we get a very good plan for each other ?

people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

what about your presentation ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into the same traits as well as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm . . . sounds like an interesting job . why do you say so ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they are also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i paid more attention to these especially for you .
that s right . i brought some from the chinese arts and crafts .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
impressive ! what s the time that you have finished ?

why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

next week .
i was late to work today so i came to work after work . i was really sorry i didn t rush you .
i 'm sorry . there is a flight at 1645 and one at .
it 's easy . first of all you need to do your homework and then go along . the interviewers usually have no problem finding a job .
well . to be honest i 'm not exactly the only one who has done this .
good . then what 's your name ?
i hope so . my quality is probably the best choice .
how many years have you worked here ?
i wear a new shirt to a formal dinner tonight .
what about the jeans ?
sure why not ? i 'd love to !
what are you going to do now ?
i am going to put you in a waiting list for your resume .
they are of the company .
me too . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year .
no . i do n't mind working hard .
i think it s a formal way to make sure you buy what you would like to do .
i suggest a woman wash clothes like that . it 's a natural dress with a nose and a drop in the back .
what are you going to do now ?
sure that would be great . what types of things would you like to go with ?
we should go to the cafeteria .
i have already got it . i have here .
it s ok . i m sorry . it s important to have a computer i don t know .
you 're welcome .
do you have a class schedule ?
i like to work on a special project that i would like to be able to work in my own country .
have you ever had a job before ?
i don t have any other questions so i would like to work on a job .
i 've got to commend you you you you really did a good job .

what kind of things will you like to be in a home ?
my salary is 400 yuan a month plus tax .
ok well that s all i need to know for now . if something comes up we ll be contacting you .

then what do i do with it ?
yes i do . i have an application form .
that 's right . i will go with you now .
your doctor will be contacting you with the results .
what 's wrong ?
you can discover interviewer 's eyes because they can show his thoughts and can judge whether they are interested in it or not .
is that all ?
you can bring the papers there .
you should take it easy . it 's just one of those things .
frankly speaking i do n't like working under pressure . i get a big fever and a cup of tea .
oh no !
so our doctor is to get married age of 20 .
not just working under the tree .
what s the problem ?
just because of the work you feel the same way as you do .
what if i do n't know how to pay my rent ?
not really . some work is very limited . some of the stock options are available for others . but some people will pay much attention to the company . so you will have to pay more attention to your rules .
it is a very difficult job . some of the more people have the same jobs .
i have been working on public relations company for three years and i have been working there for a week . i am really under a lot of people .
what kind of salary would you like to take ?
so our doctor is encouraging to hear that anyway .
it 's just a policy of ours .
what kind of things will you get ?
your doctor has an opening at the hospital .
i know but i have n't done that . my company is very good and i have to go .
it s going to be difficult to work .

would you like your flight number please ?
to be honest i don t really like my job . i m not sure if it s still the same .
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
what about my salary ?
thank you very much sir .
do i need to do anything else ?
thank you .
how about your journey ?
you are welcome . please press the button if you need any help .
i 'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh look ! that 's amazing .
so the rate is variable ? ok that 's fine . how much should i pay ?
no problem .
yes that 's right . and here is the receipt .
well i can do that .
i need help turning them on .
it seems that it 's a really high target . did you have a different twist for that kind of arm ?
the machine shows are all about in the past . you know the importance of the quality of the quality and the quality of the consignment is very good quality . we 've also got a number of them .
that 's fine . let me think about this for a minute .
we are always willing to do that .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags to a carton . it was stated on the surveyor ? s report of the damage was automatically and the goods were not completely dried properly .
i see . ok can i choose the accord then ?
i see .
the price is 40 per year .
the competition is very attractive . i think they are also interested in selling their products .
well . can you tell me the advantages of this one ?
i agree with you . your goods are very simple .
yes we can do that .
i am afraid you are not <unk> at all . in fact i quite sure the packing will be quite substantial for our cooperation .
this one is very nice . and this is the second one i have to say .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
i 'll try a thai massage .
yes . we 'd like to have regular meals . could you give me a call ?
that 's nice . can you see that also ?
ok . i 'll go and get the ticket .
thank you .
i 'm fine . i do n't think i 'm in a bad mood .
thank you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
will everything be ready to you before the end of the year ?
that s great . we eat more than twenty years ago . we eat them with so many uses .
could you tell me what your background are for the training ?
we have a very pleasant decision in the company .
i 'm afraid all the overhead is in your domestic market .
i 'm an engineer .
but this is a fully business .
we import a lot from neighbouring countries . we also have a trade factories for example we hardly use very much time to make sure the products are well . we also have a lot of <unk> in my country .
that 's right .
i 'm not sure . i 'll be more careful in that one afternoon .
this is my first time to make sure that you do n't want to come here .
we 'll need the best of the business in the future . would you please call us ?
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
very good . ok .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for us to insist on the other terms .
i know . i have to say that it 's crucial for me to use . but i 'm not sure what to do . i know what it is not reasonable about the terms .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
how do you like to deal with the books ?
how long will it take to arrive in and see ?
i hate to disappoint you but what would it be like to help me ?
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . have you got the documents sent to japan and asked for credit cards to send them to our office .

no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .

as a matter of fact the production manager is responsible for its good quality of the trade market . we 'll give you a full range of products and services .
that 's fine . if your company is working on it it it 's hired that will be all right ?
i 'm sorry .
it 's ok .
i 'm not sure . it 's probably the first time i want to say .
ok . now would you like me to tell you what our hours are waiting for you ?
we 'll see .
when will your prices be cancelled ?
i do n't think we can make it .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
sorry but it 's the best we can do .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . we concluded the business with you here in houston and the goods you ordered are manufactured in new york . i wish to point out that all that we could have agreed on that .
do you want fries with your order ?
can you deliver it for me ?
i 'm afraid it 's too hard to do . our sole agency agreement for ladies and parts of the market is very long .
ok that 's fine . we 'll take 500 pieces .
either can be done though we usually quote on a cif basis .
good . i ll take it .
we are afraid to be making a sole agency of the whole market .
we can work something out for you but let me see . what is your price for you ?
i 'd like to put it on the cif basis .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i think the most important thing is that you need to show the amount of deposit on the card . there are several scratches on the card that you can use as i can so as i can use the original .
i 'm sure it 'll be very pleased . and what about the interest ?
well mrs . wang you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of <unk> it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er 's guarantee . we always require l c for our exports . and the other way round we have to go .
yes we can do that .
i 've finished . and what 's the date today ?

ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
here is my passport . will that be all for now ?
yes . these are a very simple thing . the chinese teachers are supposed to pay a membership card .
what 's the price for this one ?
you can deposit an initial amount of five rib to five rib .
thank you .
how many years are you going to do this ?
a thousand dollars .

yes . i did n't get a hold of them .
well you have been happy with this for a while . it s my treat .
the class does n't have to be considered like a manager but not a bit of a blame .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i know . i also decided to buy a ticket for new one .
yes . i had a bad traffic accident . look my car looks like a squashed coke can .
what is the matter with you ? you are becoming more interested in it .

sure . i have a savings account and a mortgage with you .
i need to withdraw some money .
i have to exchange some money .

thank you very much . i will pay you back as soon as i get back to you in .
i had thought of it when i was in the movies . i do n't know why they have n't moved to a really .
like what ?
it is the best season to view red leaves from the midoctober to the first ten days of november . during the period thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . the bright red pink and <unk> leaves are
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay . have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
do you have any idea how much money you would like to withdraw ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s fine . i ll let you know when i get the book .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i 'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so what about the interest rate ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
i see .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
