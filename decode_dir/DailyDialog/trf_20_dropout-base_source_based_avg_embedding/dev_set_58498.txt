oh yes . i remember now .
sure . i will ask my friend to call you if you want .
sure . i think it 's too difficult to stop seeing people 's privacy .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it was n't any of me .
that s all right . thank you .
i will .
hi .
where s it ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
all right . i 'll send a larger to pick up a better picture in a few days .
we ll need to do it for a little bit . so if you ll just give me your credit card .
i will .
no problem .
thank you i will be right back .
yes you have a seat in the back .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks .
yes . that would be a bit high . both you need to include your name age and also the 20 percent of your name and beauty of your company . in my opinion you should choose to get a either of top or her .
how many nights a week is it ?
you need to pay ten cents for the copy .
can i pay by card ?
buying a soft sleeper costs <unk> one way and the cost is <unk> .
it was n't any of me .
that s all right . thank you .
well do you know where the post office is ?
thanks very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .

yes we need to do something tomorrow .
yes i know what you mean . i also need to be a good team .

i can ask them to give you a list of references right ?
i want to get a package of cigarette .
yes we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . look at this section .
it 's very practical . i do n't like the color .
i will chop your toes off one by one .
i don t like it . it s outdated .
yes . i bought it yesterday . it was the latest fashion .
maybe but that was the best idea . you can never win .

yes .

don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
is that where you live ?
ok . i 'll do it for you .
no i did n't .
what 's your membership card ?
i heard it was going to be 3 . 5 .
well . let me check . . . ok . . i guess i did n't keep the money in the overhead compartment .

okay . i 'll take the tapestry the set of table wear and the vase .
just a minute . it 's nothing to do with it .
is it very far from here ?
no problem .
i appreciate your understanding .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
that s the only thing i can take care of .
i 'd rather you typed it .
thank you very much .
yes i do . go to the next corner and turn left onto the next corner .
i 'm so honored that you think i was in the place .
not long . it 's only ten minutes walk .
how many miles to go ?
you re welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
no thanks . i m full .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the <unk> and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .

do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you 're right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be a little too . it ll probably be about how in a month .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada for 110 of the price of the real thing .

that 's something that you really need to work on .
but i 'd like to watch it .
i have heard of that there are so many people here . i found it when we get here .
you also should do the most part in the family .
i want to try on this pair .

i think i 'll have a try .
i will do that .
yes . i have many home and sort of things . i like to do some things on my own .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m just going to let you go .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
which room are you in ?
it . . the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .

yes sir what can i do for you ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'm sorry . i know . but i think i know .

what 's your wife like ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about 10 minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . you can do better tomorrow .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

i know . i am a little nervous .
it 's too difficult to get into the city centre but i have to pay a fine .
thanks . i will .
i 'm glad we 've come to work on hand .
all right . first of all it s very important for you to be punctual . that s one thing you have to wait for .
it s very nice of you . we will be in a tram or a doubledecker than on the subway .
good .
it will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection .
i can help you with that .
thank you . i will think about it . i need to get the relevant information you want .
i can text it to you .
it 's because of trade .
what happened ?
i am tired of doing that boring work .
sure . the bathroom is on the second floor .
you have a smaller one . but you have to take the stairs .
what is your impression of the coworkers ?
i tried but i didn t even twenty dollars on the shelf .
you are so kind . they are very responsible .
no but my house was in the living room and it was so far from here .
that s too bad . they must have just been there a lot of traffic light . are you kidding ?
sure ! how much is it for ?
you are speaking in the right direction .
yes it is . look at the view from the window .
i also hope the fax machine is out of paper and not within a few days .

i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .

just a minute please .
i 'm afraid i do n't . what 's your favourite dance ?
good for you .
thank you .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you in the back gate ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at s department store .
what are you primarily interested in ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um . . . if it 's my turn i 'll buy one and not my new one . . .
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
what can you do next ?
but i 'm not really interested in <unk> .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
let me see . the buying rate is rib for a issue .
it 's only a couple of minutes . do you remember how to do it ?
how long do we need to stay in here ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what would you like to see in beijing ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
i haven t seen you for several days .
why not now ? i 'm hungry .
no let 's go on saturday .

well i do n't like got any other side of them .
it 's very kind of you to say . but i can still carry on with me on my friends .
i think so . it 's only a few minutes walk .
yes they are over .
why are n't you nervous ? they are just urban . they are not allowed to play up at the public transport system to make them quick .
mom i do n't have any blood pressure .
sure . this brand is supposed to be very good but they 're expensive . those are new products .
what about the hotel accommodations ?
you do n't like things like that .
yes of course . it 's a most popular dish for everyone .
what 's the fare ?
it 's about 5 yuan .
how about the umbrella ? it 's made of wood and paper .
i needed to save the rest of my life so i learned to save the rest of my life .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do n't talk .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i 've created a monster . . . you 're done . .
what do you think i ought to do ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
that 's true . do you know there are many english students studying there ?
we are all out of them .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
hello . what s the problem ?
how about oil or spray ?
yes .
ok i 'll be back as soon as possible .
i 'd like to send it to shanghai on the 10th .

fine . i will begin by your office at 3
it 's on sale today .
it 's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ?
what is the earliest one available ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
why do n't we have a different outside hand ?
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very good . now if you 'll just give me your credit card and i 'll give you a certificate .
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
we 've bought all the products in two styles .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . peel the skin with a sharp knife and throw out the seed .
maybe you should try looking at my chinese food and then i 'll get it .
it 's a fruit .
i 'll take them all right away .
what about this one ? it 's very smart .
no . not really .
where do they grow it ?
i guess i 'll take them .
i come from countries .
well we just got in some mangoes .

well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is 1 each .

they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .

that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2 . 5 liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
yes . i get it .

it 's 9 . 95 . do you want me to put it in a box ?
here is the fare and keep the change please .
i do n't think so .
that 's all right . we ll get used to it . besides it is quiet up there .
yes it 's not far away then . we can walk on the <unk> lake .
yes it 's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
what about the kitchen ?
it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen . the stove and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .

hello . is steve there ?
what 's the matter
thank you . that 'll be all .
yes i have a driving license .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
yes that would be great . but please give me a call next week .
see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! do you think i can have a brochure of the job ?
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh right . i 'll go into the number .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12000 a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he is out .
what time do you expect him back then ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me how much you want to pay ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the center of the city and the
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
it is a little bit expensive . do you have any cheaper ones ?
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
i 'll be late every day .
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
i 've never had one before .
hello steven !
wow ! what a beautiful day !
i am terribly sorry i did n't realize that .
very well thank you .
i 've been working too .
i 'm glad you 've done a lot .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you are a good employer .
see you on wednesday .
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i have two years of teaching esl and four years of teaching perschool children .
i 've never thought of that .
not bad . i suppose i 'm an accomplish so .
what is she like ?
no it 's not . it 's a holiday . why do n't you come here to see me ?
hmm . . . i think one of the stockholders who can make a serves of moves to go .
but i 'll be late for school tomorrow .
very well . thank you for coming today .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking for a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
no i think that 's just what i want . i am glad you are satisfied with your work .
no you have to turn it in at the next window .
you re going to need to take a break !
fine ! i ll stop by your promise !
what 's the use of these mangoes ?
can you play the game ?
um i guess it 's not just a them . we need to get them in the morning . there 's a question . do n't worry .
what ?
oh no . i m sorry .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
how many ?
what s wrong with that ? i think i ll need a polaroid .
are you kidding ? how old is he ?
i see . then i can buy you a set of pearl earrings . which set up this magazine ?
sure . i 'll get right on it .
oh the music has stopped .
how much are they ?
well how about this one ? it 's a little tight and the handle .
i have found an incredible ability to buy people from animals for men .
! sentences poems habeas en !
i agree but i still prefer an art story .
what 's it look like lady ? this is the sort of thing i 'm looking for .
yes i think you prefer this one .
yes it s in the last stretch .
that s right . everything is so fine . let s take a look .
well i was hoping that you would like to come to my office .
you 're welcome .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! you are going to take measures to check out the weight of every three years .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
thank you . i really like it .
no . that 's all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like a oneinch photo for my interview .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
what about the special effects ?
mmm well this is our i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses and a dozen of blue roses . that s the same shirt we ve got .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
what are you talking about ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking so called washing machine .
what about the special effects ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well . it 's a secret . i 'll take it .
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hello i 'm here to talk to someone about a fixed asset loan .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no don t ! we ll take it .
awesome !
yes i had a job with a stock market analyst .
we will be coming . i hope you will be all right .
can you describe your health concern ?
i agree . it was not that big enough but it s so small . the problem is that you have to give me a chance .
ok then you can ask the coffee counter if you want to . i m afraid there is something more important to do .
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
i am sorry . we have no on hand now .
can you describe your books for me ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need to buy this scarf ready .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it does . just come back from taiwan .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s so nice and the sun is right over there .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get a few new furniture . better stuff .
i do n't know .
thank you .
it s nice to meet you too .
the rent is 1050 every month .
that s way too much .
it s on sale today .
what can i help you with ?
by the way we would cafeteria cafeteria .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
i won t go any lower than 1050 .
i think a chinese student <unk> on written english and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he s learning vocabulary and of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
you can t expect that .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah they are my good menu . i 'll take them .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
this is all right . would you like anything to drink ?
an ordinary one ?
sure . let me show you some . . . this one is very nice . it 's pure wool .
i don t think the price is too high .
i ll take it .
what would you like to drink ?
yes they are . i can t wait to see the old house . i can t wait to play anymore .
one . i want to have a red one .
thank you . this is a very nice girl .
any particular colour ?
the price is even lower than the others .
the dress is over there .
i am sorry he is out in a meeting now . can i take a message ?
i was wondering if the position is on the line is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think it would be better for me to go in a quiet neighbourhood . there is a shower and the blue building is very quiet .
i will be there . how much will it be ?
fine . i 'll be expecting you .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i think i 'll find the there .
you 're welcome .
thank you .
no . just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
how about this one ? i 'll take it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
you know i 'm not so familiar with the city too .
i like the jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .
i think you ll find the right place .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
i think i 'll take a look at the others .
they said they have cut into the registry . there is a separate refrigerator and a big kitchen .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i 'll take the pink one .
we 're planning to get one hundred and twenty .
perfect ! you can pick up your sunday night .
let s rock n roll .
i can t believe it !
but i 'm not used to looking up every new word when i 'm reading a novel . i only look up the most necessary ones .
my god ! it 's a manmade wonder . i can get a city map of the city .
i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in the park .
i love the museums . they 're so beautiful .
that 's right . if you are in a different world you will take part in the design .
that s the aroma of coffee beans .
i am sorry you have the wrong number .
hello this is the property manager . i 'm calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . how do you want to help ?

i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ?
yes .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and and and and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
do you have your computer qualifications ?
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok . please take a seat . do you need a shampoo ?

say hello to your family for me .
ok let 's go .

i have to get a few things to choose from . if you remember to take a job or something .

i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
certainly sir would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
no . i 've never . but i 've never learned martial arts and there is another thing .
do you like some soup ?
it 's my pleasure .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques . besides we have different types of food restaurants and different styles .
ok . i 'll have a try .
it 's a good idea to have a taste .
of course i can help you . but you do n't have to worry about the service .
you see . i 've been working here for three years .
you know i need to buy some clothes at the store . i need a new suit .
oh i see . then i guess i can get to the office by bus or on the bus .
you can get the email or you can use the computers to send them to your email .
rin ?
i hope you enjoyed your stay .
ok i will take it .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
your price has gone up sharply has n't it ?
well we promise that your prices are much too high .
ok . what time do you want to work ?
they are short of clothes .
maybe i should have a try .
yes go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i know but i like the feeling .
of course . there are many people here . and you can do some shopping in the neighborhood .
there is a lot of coffee shops .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i understand . i think you 're right but i just still have to decide if you follow the fashion .
i believe it 's the cheapest on the west side of the city .
this is the menu . come here . the items are good .
the late fee is 25 cents a day .
it 's a good thing . i think we 'll be able to do so .
just pay me back .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
sure . do you have your receipt ?
yes here you are .
great . here 's the receipt .
i ca n't find the key and i have to turn it on .
go and try it on .
are you kidding ? i do n't think it 's too late .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford that .
ok . i will do them .
is it so simple ?
my dad is a doctor .
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't do anything with it .
i know . it is an important thing to do .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . so i do n't think i 'll be able to work with you in person .
here you are .
thank you .
yes i think so . i am sorry .
i 've only one . i want to get a credit card .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
could you give me a few more tests to get enough of your future ?
i do n't know .
do you have a fever ?
it 's not just that the idea is that they have a lot of energy to eat .
you mean sweet food ?
there is a supermarket nearby ? i thought you might want some more of the people .
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
i hope the opera will be more important .
actually i 've only got the money .
but i am afraid it 's too hard for me to keep them from my place .
yes i went there last week .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
you are right ! everything is absolutely delicious !
i usually just go to bed at least twice a week .
yeah you are right . i m serious . you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
you bet .
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever but dance might make you livelier and happier .
smaller local dishes .
last week i went to a party and some friends who have a whole day there and no <unk> tonight . i thought we might be able to get all the robinson s really good friends .
sorry sir . we do n't . but i 'm sure you will like it .
well healthy food is not good for each other .
it 's a place to make your own decisions .
yeah . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
i like both strawberry and coffee ice cream .
it 's easy . the clock and have the bad news .
that 's right .
it 's no problem . i 'll be back right away .
sure . i 've also got a headache .
well i guess you are right .
thank you you you are so thoughtful . i think i could use some beers right now .
no . you can keep an eye on the ground .
it 's still a good idea to save .
i 'm not sure . if you want to make a withdrawal i 'll just use the atm .
no thanks . i like coffee . and i 'd like to have a cup of tea .
they are 168 .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll try that .
you 've got a deal !
not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy .
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you want to cook some kebabs ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .

my parents give me a topic .

my mother is ill in the hospital .
what 's the matter ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
but you are ! you just got married .
i was talking to you about a year ago .
i agree with you sir but i think he may do well .
i think i want to try a new style .
why ca n't he be so sure ?
i have been studying english for 6 years .
i understand .
i 've just been married for about five years . how about you ?
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
i will be leaving on the fifth floor .
oh it 's really a beautiful city .
how long have you been playing piano ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
one of my friends said the same thing . i 'll have to get back to you in a few days .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
can you recommend me some kind of sites ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will have a good time here .
i like your positive attitude . how much is it ?
what 's the purpose for your visit ?
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
i know but you 're right . it 's hard to find a good way to make new clothes .
i bought it one size up by mistake .
i see . we got a good choice .
what about your friend <unk> in the class ?
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm still a . i 'm living in room .
i like to go to the movies .

let 's see you then .
see you then .

i think i 'm going to take the course . i need to get the scholarship .
i think so . what do you want to know ?
i 'm dead serious .

i 've never heard of a black leather belt that is kind of dressy .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
really ? i do n't think i will go there myself .
because i 'm living a real world a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money .
oh i need to order a large sum of money .

i want to study abroad .

well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .

that 's right . and i get too many new friends . i 'll have a lot of fun .

i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
it 's on memorial avenue .
ok . i will take it .
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . i will call my wife and take a look at it .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i understand . thank you very much .

it 's still early . the students have to work on saturdays .
i want to be a manager .
take your time .
yes it is .
in addition to your major did you have other fields to study ?
i 'm going to need some more time .
and what 's your major ?
i see . do you want to study hard ?
i see . do you have some suggestions ?
it 's not like you 've been listening to a job .
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
really ? i 'm surprised .
i have no idea .
i think that 's a bad idea . do you want to join us ?
i went to high school in english and i took a lot of courses .
three or four ?
but there is n't a big difference .
i thought you would be a bit more excited about the pass .
yes i did . i worked as a personnel manager in a stateowned company and then i transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the food market in china .
your price is rather high . did you have a high price ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
oh cheer up .
but i still ca n't believe it .
it 's not the first time i want to watch it .
i start studying for my chemistry exam .
it 's almost impossible to get the price .
let me see . did you guys go on a date already ?
it was n't as high as i would have liked .
your performance is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . i hope i ve made my point .
because of the low salaries .
did you guys go on a date already ?
i think i caught a cold .
how do you think about him ?
okay which bus do i need to take ?
hi .

not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .

it 's just a couple of minutes .

i go to the university . i m going to check my parents for an apartment .
i think you re right . i ll get a promotion to do the job and you can t get a chance to practice .
that s a great idea . do you know any people who can hire you ?
i remember a lot .

i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
oh i m not a big fan of using my own . they ve been invited to a party for the next month .
yes . i like the design of the buildings and the names of the old buildings .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to get a package of cigarette .

the port will be 7 .
oh the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense .
well . it 's 2 dollars being covered by the contract . we will also allow our short and we will consider the next step . this means that we will do a draft .
but thank you very much all the same .
no problem . i thought it was a bit difficult .
well i was born and raised in the high school but i need to be a little more practical .
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like you have to use the computer to do .
i 'm not sure if that would be wise .
i used to be a part of my own . but now she 's getting a big fan of him too .
are there any mail for the class ?
we are waiting for the car service . please follow me .
thank you for calling .
if we do n't go on a day off we may consider a holiday .

you may be pretty good .
i 'm not very sure . which subject did you like best ?
i want to know about the fees .
have you taken a walk ?
but i 'm not a fit .
let me see . i think it s because you want to make a different kinds of cereal .
i don t think it 's very difficult to answer . i don t want to be able to list those things that we need to do .
what are your plans for ?
yes i will . do you want to help me with my new cards ?
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
i have a problem .
do you have your library card ?
oh yeah . here you go .
what ?
yes i d like to do that .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
thank you .
there you go .
what ?
what was the rent for a year ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i really do n't think i was wrong with her .
that s all right . but i 'm not sure how to do this .
because i want to know what kind of movie i have in mind .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
no i do n't think she will do such a thing .
i can t wait to see him .
but my father has always been keen on his homework .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i 'm going to give you a gift .
it 's so interesting .
i agree . but it was not the only thing .
sometimes you do n't have a wellbalanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
i m crazy about it too . it s a secret .
um . . . i can ask my parents to come home and take care of yourself . maybe i can get a new one .
yes .
thanks . i can t wait to see you .
well you have to have it ready .
so you re traveling by train .
you are smart . the everything is so fine .
that 's true . but that 's true . she has to go to the university of 20 .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
i think it 's because my father is a huge body .
afterwards we can do that .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i thought he only liked to go together .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show .
what is it ?
you are so lucky .
it does n't matter . no one will have to return it by the window .
i think so .
so i am not in the mood for some information .
you are in love with the guy .
so when you did n't have to go to the party ?
on the floor .
that 's too bad .
why ? what 's wrong ?
the blue dress is the right sizea perfect fit ! i like to try it on . oh yes .
yes it is .
it s very nice of you to say so . i should say you are glamorous yourself as a matter of fact .
what a pity . i 'll take one .
of course i am too .
that sounds like a good idea .
she is also in love with her .
of course not but sometimes the results make you happy .
i 'm just in a bad mood . i feel a little tired .

i think i 'm making a few friends .
what is your favorite flower ?
a lot of people in my dorm are sick . perhaps you ll be there often be a lot of people .

i like her very much .
oh shut up my mind . you 're such a terrific guy !
i feel sorry for her .
it 's really a surprise .
i had no idea . it was completely different to her .

mr . smith is not in his office .
maybe they have n't been sitting there .

they 're not kidding . they 're so stressed . i 'm not wet .
well it was about a person who tried to explain the reasons . i was n't sure what we had on that guy .
oh i see . so you 're busy then . will you give me a call ?
ok i 'll have them call me back later .
i do n't think so . i 'm just shaken up a little .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .
which one ?
it 's an easy way to get hurt .
well the sales representative had nice to give you a 5 year a day . it was n't too bad .
i 'm so sorry i was so attracted . i did n't think of anyone .
i 'm so sorry i did n't know she was n't very happy with that .
oh how awful ! hey how can we get there ?
no i do n't .

no i did n't . i only get used to it .
how much do you want ?
no . i 'd like to go straight .
i 'm sorry . <unk> is running into our wedding anniversary .
i really appreciate the way you could come here . it 's really beautiful .
i 'm afraid that 's the flower girl and the ring is playing with the wind .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding did you ?
you 're moving now ?
that 's exactly what i want .
they were really good . you can t do anything on the first floor . . they were really popular . . .

i fell down and hurt my arm .

then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .

you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .

do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
a great idea . i 'll be a volunteer for the campaign .
good . let 's go now .
how long would you like to stay ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what 's the matter ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .

i do n't want to .

the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .

it 's the best seller for this season .
then my son drove into a tree
no response silence
hello . i want to send this package to japan .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .

i feel horrible . i went to the hospital in the afternoon .
you know i must have left it somewhere . i hope i can get a taxi to be here .
oh what 's the next bus ?
does it always close at six ?
here 's the list . i 'll be right over there .
oh i see . you can always do many things on the day .
well i m just wondering if you like the new italian guys . . .
how much would you like to spend ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you come to the mmm place ?
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
sounds good . how long will it take to reach the buffet ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just had a bad day yesterday .
i was sitting in the living room watching tv . i was hoping that i could get asleep in the morning .
oh that s great . what s wrong with you ?
incredible . by the way what are we gonna do today ?
you know that i care for you .
can you put your hand where it is ?
you think ?
yes . good for you .
it s a most important thing to me .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you .
fine . let s just sit in the back . .
thanks a lot .
oh really ? i am glad we will have to wait for the next bus .
oh shut up ! i will try my best to persuade those people to cooperate with each other .
it 's still early .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's nice . will it be the color or the color ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i hope you 're not turning into a sissy on me dave .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
i see . what are you talking about ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
yeah . it 's really a nice game .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how do you feel about them ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
what is your greatest weakness ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
you are kind . i hope you don t feel like a business trip .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i am sorry i can t help you .
i really feel so stupid .
i think you re right but i think it s better to take the shirt with the jeans and a silk shirt . i need to buy a new pair .
anyway i think we need to buy a new page . i m not sure we can do it .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you sound like my mom . i want to do my own game .
take it easy . some are just beautiful .
i know what you mean . i just want a good physique with weights and carpio .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals and <unk> ! i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
i get a couple of different colors and i 'll take them out to the spot . but the problem is that i 'm too busy to be friends .
ok dad ! i don t want you to think we re gonna have a cold .
i 'm going to bill 's house .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you think we 'll have a lot of fun too ?
ok i ll just take a look . and we ve got to get back to our brass tasks and tidy these things up .
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i see . by the way what should i do if i am not finished with the boss ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you have some friends ?
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
no . i have n't . my wife and i have to be a volunteer for the next two years . she asked me to be a volunteer .
absolutely ! i made lots of friends and i hope my parents were scared of me .

yeah it 's hard to believe but i love the game on the sand from this beautiful day .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
yeah . i started learning english for almost every semester .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .

it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .

yeah some friends play it all night all night all night . i was never doing well .
yeah i agree . and i just hope my paul is become a real fan of the things .

japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .

so for now you have to type one on the one .
you were right . it was from a headhunter . she would n't tell me anything without a contract .

you can do that . it 's not a local housing contract .

hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
sorry .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
are they all made of exceptionally good quality ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
what s that ?
you are a very helpful and experienced secretary .

that 's because you want to hear my favorite friend .
well i know i might get one in this question . but this may be my dear .
no i do n't think so . i 'd like to go to the training center tonight . what about the second page ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
really ? how long were you going to stay ?
no not really . i was on the train
it 's great . congratulations .
yes i did .
it 's really hard for me to work .
it 's true . but i really need to have a holiday to relax and take care of the people .
over here sir .
they 're probably going to be sold out .
a slow should make an early start .
no please feel free .
i was wondering what the salaries are like ?
well we 're not very particular with your skirt . i think you 'll like the blue one .
please do n't call me sir .
disco is my favorite . i do n't know what to make .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's not easy to explain . i have a questions about the new year s resolution and also the moon over the world .
no i do n't think much of a person .
oh yes . music is a beautiful dance .
that 's not why i was thinking .
that 's interesting !
yes . it 's why many people here in china and the united states are here .
but is n't it the same with <unk> ?
in order to prevent the fish from being set in different parts of the table and enjoy the medicine .
that 's good . and your father is the only one we need to show them the basic rules you know .
in the sense it is by the way to china .
you 're right . she 's the expert of it .
you mean the time ?
yeah . i like it very much .
let me see . . . you may find out what you like .
that 's ok . i like dancing .
i do n't know . i already tried to pop music but i 'm not very tired .
thank you for the dance .
i 'm glad you say so .
yes i 'd like to . but i do n't have any hobbies .
how do you spend your time ?
to a disco ?
oh a . mom i 'm not a very good dancer and i love hip hop dancing .
yes i like it very much .
what about your performance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i do . but i 'm not much of a dancer . .
i am sorry but i need to write you a letter of recommendation .
i agree . i appreciate the talk .
i didn t get accepted .
oh i like the music .
no . i like to play golf play rather than piano .
your brain is really healthy .
yes . i like english very much .
sounds like a good idea .
what 's your favorite dance ?
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
well then may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
mmmm . . . it 's hard to say . i like golf a i guess i like tennis better .
then what about spring ?
no but i do n't know the quality .
oh i see . since i 'm a heavy smoker may i put on a scale ?
i do n't think so . you look too pale . let 's go to a dance club .
what kind of visuals should i use ? i am not so sure . do you know what i should write a name ?
yes it is . but it 's nice and the building is so warm .
i 'm glad you told me .
that s a good idea .
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the south .
what do you think of the weather we 've been having ?
i like spring .
i may take it too .
it s a little . i am sure the silence will begin to grow on me .
yes the weather is so nice .
it 's so cold .
oh i like the winter too . can i leave on sunday evening ?
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
in about 25 minutes . it was one of the biggest cities .
yes . it is .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i 've never seen a movie before .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
wonderful ! i have a great idea !
yeah some places are very short of water .
that 's very kind of you .
yes the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
yes .
so you 're from south america ?
do n't worry about it .
thank you very much for your hospitality .
you need to ask the phone .
i am sorry . i 'll be very busy right now .
i appreciate you saying so . i thought you had a good time .
what would you suggest to see in beijing ?
sure what is it ?
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
on friday .
it 's time for a picnic .
i 'll pick you up at your hotel at noon . be there or be some drinks before you come .
yes . i am . what 's up ?
we 're glad that you 're in love .
i 'd like to very much .
are you going to the train station ?
oh do you have a club card ?
this afternoon .
ok . let me check . thank you very much .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
yes it is .
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
they do . i never know why they have n't been using the car . it was only a couple of days . after that your country does n't have a good time .
i ca n't log on the internet again .
how about this one ? it 's so nice of you to say so .
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about 100 degrees in the summer !
i do n't care . i 'm just in the kitchen .
no . that s all .
why do n't you just get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
i know ! i never had a bad time !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i 'm afraid not . he 's in jail for at the moment .
you re welcome .
you 're welcome . bye .
it is so so .
oh thanks that 's just my job . i have to take good care of myself .
how did you get to your previous sense ?
yes he does . he s really a nice guy .
would you like to talk to him ?
because it 's supposed to be good for you .
it 's a pity . you paid a 50 dollars per unit . that means that no wonder our price is rising .
then i 'll try to catch it on .
oh i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've had a date already .
after the trouble of the meeting you should take a seat .
i 'm sorry i 'm not available tomorrow night .
i 'm afraid this summer is not bad .
i am so sorry .
they are holding people here .
that 's a good place to make a happy family .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
you too !
you 're welcome . hope you 'll visit us again soon .
i hope you have a good trip to china .
you 're welcome . goodbye .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
you are always responsible and careful .
that 's pretty much like an old one .
i just want to give her a chance like that .
yes .
oh you know . she is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now .
you are so lucky ! i can help you in the computer . i m standing in the garage for a while . i m standing in a big mess . you can t miss it .
i 'd love to but i 'm afraid it 's too expensive for me .
ok . let me check my schedule . would that be a problem ?
i never thought we could be good enough to have our own ways . but now that it 's not easy for us to work .
it 's easy . it 's important to have the exam tomorrow . first of all you should do is to have enough time for your exam .
i think it 's something that you really need to work on .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . people in the next year will not take the plane with the public .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
yes . i was . the movie producer the director the director the super boy who were very pleased with the language .
so you always have stayed in bed for two days .
it might be the most fun i ve ever had .
they 're just like a fashion designer . next month it 's a fashion show .
what kinds of questions did you say about them ?
which floor are you on ?
i know but i bought it to be very fashionable .
well i 'm not one to gossip as you know .
absolutely . that 's really nice of you . i hope the fashion show was n't as good as you did .
yes . but we 'll be careful .
the brown leather shoes are really comfortable .
please do n't worry . i 'll take it .
well i hope you 're not turning into a good mood .
i think you should go to the interview to see what the doctor said . try to get some rest .
first we make sure that the name of the stores will be quite helpful and also some important issues for the interview .
i could give you a few days off if you give me a discount .
sure what s wrong ?
yes you are right .
and you 're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
oh it 's unbelievable . you 're american men !
no . it 's not .
not really . i just heard about that . and it was half off the plane .
they are all so interesting .
i know girls love this kind of thing .
they are all handmade . you know the meaning of christmas .
i ca n't bear it right ? i 've even seen a sweat .
i do n't know . they 're going to be the first time .
hello mr . miao ping i can t wait to speak to mr meng .
i do n't like it .
sure . i need to do some things for you . besides i need to know the application for this scholarship .
yeah you need to make a list of what you need .
the last beginning class starts on october 25th .
oh i did n't know that . it was early .
then my son drove into a tree
thanks a billion .
do you think i could put in a few classes for him ?
fine . i 'll be there around two .
she 's in the united states . but i 'm not sure . probably it 's the right person to ask about it .
really ? it 's a beautiful city .
i really have liked it here .
that 's a long time !
she lives in the city .
no i didn t sleep until quite late .
really ? how did you get involved in something ?
yes i have one .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .

thank you .
no i 'm free . i 'll be there around two .
i am sorry i did n't know that . ok let 's go to the gym to have a look at your bag .
and a storm blew our roof away .
but the best you can do is to yourself a little bit without yourself . no one has ever said anything else to eat .
how do i know ?
yeah . but my brother has never been pregnant for another two months .
but i m not sure .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york .

i already have a foursome with them .
i do n't have the slightest idea .
you are why ?
i 'd like to very much .
how does 730 sound ?
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes sometimes it 's too difficult .
we can do that . and then we could go to the movies .
well the hardcover is more expensive .
the performance is excellent .
what kinds of questions did you have in mind ?
well he 's got a great voice .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no i 'll be happy to give you another chance .
i guess i ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you re too busy every evening doing god knows what . . god don t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .
because in this dutyfree shop your total expenditure cannot be over 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
it 's a good idea . have you taken the bus before you leave ?
it s a great school .
of course i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow morning ?
all right ! let 's call it a deal .
i do n't know but i do n't really know how to do that .
do you think that you 'll be using a lot of money ?
i was hoping to go out somewhere for something and something else .
i suggest you just go to the gym and do some pizza .
i do n't think i will need your help right away .
yes it is a most popular dish .
it 's a great idea . let 's go !
yes it is . i 'm just going to let you know .
and this is for everyone 's sake .
yeah she 's the most experienced project manager .
this is a nice office .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm busy .
i 'll be there !
either one is ok .
sure . our local theater is located on the second floor .
sure we will . you 're free on the telephone .
i 'll do that .
i 'm sorry . when did you get your phone ?
could you tell me how you feel ?
it 's very hot the temperature is often over 40c .
i do n't know .
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
but i like the feeling .
because i 'm living a real world a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?

you too . i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
i have been feeling pretty well .
i have been sick for a year . and you ?
you know that i 'm trying to find this place .
i have been a secretary for 2 years and i have been working for the past two years .
why do you want to work for our company ?
i 'm majoring in english .
in a way it 's similar to the public office .
i 'm sure you know . i 'm always trying to find a job .
i 've been out of town .
you are always so naughty . by the way do you have a dog ?
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes . i graduated this past june .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
i 'm fine thanks . what about you ?
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
oh there is n't ?
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
no i do n't like them . they 're boring .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
it 's beautiful .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
because i have found a lot of them .
well i guess you re right . i m so sorry .
whatever . have you got all the dishes ?
she 's pretty conservative .
you have to be joking !
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine thanks .
he must have been if we could make a mountain of tickets .
not bad .
she would be happy to go with you .
he has a bad cold .
what about his wife ?
you really want to be a politician ?
yes i know that . but i 've never told him before .
yes . maybe he 's just a little bit tired .
there is a fire in your building . you need to evacuate immediately .
well . people can only hear what north and sports there are a lot of popular kinds of golf courses .
it is really a great mother .
yeah but she looks amazing .
you mean she is a teacher ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
but they are n't very happy you know .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i should have told you that i have called . they are always on the phone .
i do n't know .
not too bad .
i m afraid you are being too particular about your food .
you can t be serious .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
great . that 's a good idea .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
you have to . it was a very funny game .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
what was the matter with you ?
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
did you do anything else ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
i know he really deserves his behavior .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am quite familiar with the medicine industry and i enjoy the mixing of the medicine industry .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
do you think that they are a good idea ?
i 'll tell him you 're here .
that 's why i promised that we 'd better leave for him through my math .
what happened ?
thank you .
i want to know something about american people and the title of my career .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . many chinese usually they give up their special education .
why not ?
when do you start ?
what 's the matter with you ?
i bought it for other people and asked them to carry it back on to my own .
well i hope you 're making a big progress .
i turned down in half an hour ago .
yes . i think americans are well matched .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
well i 'm sure he 's satisfied with that .
no doubt . her husband is the only thing to do .
well . . .
well we all get along well with each other and fight a lot .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
what kinds of questions did you like ?
how do you live in the neighborhood ?
then i 'll give you a hand . it 's nothing .
i doubt it . it s a lovely day .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
but i think he 's really a good team .
yes . i like you and i think you re awesome .
i like them but i am not really into all that .
i like blue to be very much .
but many people like that . they are not delicious .
you are right . i should feel <unk> about her .
well i 'm afraid i do n't think i was the only person who could be friendly .
i 'm not crazy about it .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad . i 'm just in the mood these days .
you must have been really lucky .
thank you . i 'm seven .
how old is your sister ?
i did n't know you were a child .
i did n't get my texts !
well there are a lot of people waiting to get along with each other .
i m not sure . one day i never really . what about you ?
what kind of relationship is he ?
sure . i used to be very fond of people .
oh but you know he is a really good guy .
thanks a lot .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .

maybe next week .
yes that 'd be all right .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
sounds great i 'd very much like to accept your invitation thanks when ?
7 o 'clock and there is no problem for you .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
see you .
he 's a very good kid .
can you describe a little bit in a time ?
i would n't lie about something like that .
i feel terrible now .
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting .
how do your children take the children ?
yeah that s true .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no . i might need to see your id card but that 's about it .
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty .
we have to do this but we 'll be so late .
i 'm so sorry to hear that . could you please go to the station for a few minutes ?
i am sorry i think that she was too naughty .
what was she wearing ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
yes what can you recommend ?
that 's right . you know i am a little worried about the city .
i think it s a great idea . but i m not sure .
i 'm so sorry . the name is <unk> .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't buy one .
yes it is . but he s kind of boring .
don t worry . it s fine .
oh that s all right . don t worry . we ll get them to you soon .
oh good . then we will be there in one hour .
you know him who built the day ! he s a very exciting guy !
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
people who play ultimate frisbee have a positive attitude maybe they can manage it for a couple of years .
i know . but they re dangerous . maybe they just have a good cold .
no problem .
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
let s take an xray to the doctor .
great . i hope so . bye !
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
it s a very beautiful place to go but i think it s suppose .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
well i did n't think of anything .
have you finished it yet ?
yeah this is the latest model . if you like it you can try it on .
but that 's a good idea to help it calm your health .
i 'm doing well . how about you mary ?
fine thanks . how are you doing these days ?
so we can get down to business .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the central music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ?
not really . i thought it was disappointing .
how much was the ticket ?
it 's going to be 12 .
oh thanks . you must be tom .
yes . i 'd like to send this parcel to changchun .
yes .
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
i m going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
you know in china we usually do n't open presents until the guests leave .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
no way . i don t like any kind of food .
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 're out of your seat .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i ever heard of a woman that just by me .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
i think i 'm in touch .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
that 's a good idea . but i 'm afraid we 're going to help john .
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
let s see . you bought a compact car ?
no can i take a message ?
i want to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
cindy you are so lucky .
just fine . how is everything with you ?
i 'd love to but i 'm busy .
how about 7 o 'clock ?
thank you . good evening mary .
good evening mr . smith .
yes i have seen her .
thank you . i hope you like it .
nice to meet you david .
thank you . i ve been very busy lately .
how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
oh i ll be there on time .
i hope you will have a good journey .
oh i like the music on your radio .
you should try and find out what to do .
i have a sore throat and headache .
that s a good idea .
yes i am . i am looking for a job that is in a big maintenance problem .
i also need your own sweet tooth .
that 's great to hear . we are looking for a new scheme to choose a new model and a new one .
yeah .
yes you are right . we will have to adjust the price accordingly .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we have to do this . first it 's the most important thing we have to do is to prepare the waiter .
i understand .
here 's the receipt .
is our car very high ?
this is your cubicle . at first you ll be responsible to the development of your personal affairs .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
well i 'm not so sure . we may have some trouble to go to the movies .
no . not really .
i would like to but i think i 'll be at home then .
you should take their advice . they know the post office is very important .
not really . my father told me that she 's living at home .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
how sweet . they make the friends also have a good time .
i know but i still a lot of the money . i 'm glad you 're out of it .
just two people .
are you planning on going to university ?
i did n't know that . they simply had an accident .
but it 's true . i was lucky with my oldest she figured it out by herself and did n't tell my son .
mine are n't very happy with all . we have n't had a lot of money in our country .
sounds interesting !
the information is a product that is and information on the job and i 'm also wondering if it 's true .
that 's so bad . i 'm sure i will study a hobby .
i see . well then what about your friend <unk> ?
oh very interesting .
yes i am aware of them .
that 's right . dark blue is a little dark .
you bet . but bob s going to be on the other day .
great ! i hope you are all right .
that 's right . his father is a nice girl but he is very dangerous .
my sister likes to go to the movies . he is a small town and very active child .
i bet it s an excellent one . a lot of people love each other . they say it s fine .
what about this ?
yes i used to work as a teacher . i was a baby at a university .
yes the foreign language is really popular .
but that sounds terrible !
oh that is good . but if you ever exercise my son is doing counting some money .
she asked me about my ability to work in a company and what i thought a good boss should be .
i d like to but i m flying home .
i understand .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
exactly .
i ve been out of town . i m really far away from here .
oh really ? how did you do that ?
i went to the beach in the mountains .
what kind of work did you do at the end of the year ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've been here for almost a year .
oh . so what was the time you came here ?
i like playing football . it s a very difficult game .
i like talking to you too .
it s not like it .
yes i am . i find my name and address very much .
how about your mother ?
about 10 hours .
do you want to go to the gym ?
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
that s true . but i m afraid i never exercise .
why do you have to go to the gym ?
you can list your education at the top or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
you can stay in the shallow area . i think that we can play together in the morning .
we should do this more often .
well we could go to a movie or a lake . i love their music .
oh that s very interesting .
no i was out . i 'm really tired .
do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?
merry christmas ! mr . leo i thought you had a good time .
well i am not one who is directly involved in work . we do n't have much time to watch the game at the moment .
you re so lucky !
you are a very good student .
me too . it 's a game game all about the academy awards .
do n't worry . i 'll be a piece of cake for you .
in my country football is brand new so i never learned the game when i was younger .
i do n't like to play basketball .
i 'm sorry to hear that . is that right ?
well i just know what you mean . i m not a child . i just watch too much .
the people i work for the family i wanted to have a time with you .
i 'm not sure now .
you are really a good accountant . how do you think about the experience ?
dad i have to go to the gym too . i ca n't wait to be late !
that 's true . but you know the space is the parking lot .
it is . but if you are at it you will have time for you .
i see .
of course not . but i still prefer to keep learning daily to keep active .
i do n't know . it s hard to find out more about food .
i love to play the piano . i 'm also keen on it .
what are your future plans and what are you going to do if you 're in school ?
i 'm afraid not .
you are really a wet blanket .
oh do n't ask anyone . you do n't want to tell anyone what 's going to do ?
yeah i 'm working on the team 's team . i know they 're going to be on the sales team .
i do n't think so . i think they 're a wellmatched couple .
what makes you say that ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
hey in that case would you mind if i ask you a question ?
great ! well i 'll see you in the morning .
i do n't think we 'll have much to discuss here .
what can i do for you ?
ha ha come on ! what would you do if we win for this position ?
i am fine thanks . just a little tired .
and i get over to exams at the high school . and i thought i 'd just have n't done anything to do .
what ? you did n't ? wow !
and you know that he is the president of the company .
i 'm having dinner with my family .
you can t think of anything ?
this is just what i wanted .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i suggest you read him carefully .
you did n't get it . it 's really important .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right .
i hate to hear that . what did they say ?
that 's interesting . i guess i 'll drive to him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousandyearold tree .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i do n't think i 'm polite but i just need to explain the truth .
oh i have an application form . you can go to the baggage department to pick up your ticket .
yeah . it 's a good idea .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
is he working in our office ?
i am so sorry that i have n't got you any more .
i do n't know . i do n't think they have a very expensive wedding in a city .
you are a lucky child .
i don t know .
the problem was that i could use the ran through her so i could not express it .
those people are different countries . what 's your favorite sport ?
you know that she is a still a healthy girl .
well i do n't know .
what 's the make ?
i 'm in a good mood today actually . how about you ?
me too . i 'll see you tomorrow then !
well the only thing i 've ever heard is a few things !
absolutely .
no i did n't .
really ? have you seen that people ?
i 'm leaving on sunday morning .
oh yes .
i not really did .
oh really ? sorry .
it was only a few minutes to get it .
i see .
well we could visit a factory in the city and we have plenty of tickets .
sure .
the doctor said that he would like to start on the internet .
yes please . do you have any more questions about this ?
all right . let 's start the business shall we ?
i am also thinking about the pay .
ah yes i see . what are you reading ?
i never knew that .
yes they are . besides there are too many boys and sister can learn them well .
yes of course . in fact we have a credit rating of your salary .
good . i 'll put some lawn furniture outside the front to the window .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
it 's very nice of you . hope you will have a nice trip home .
you are so kind .
is that a company is next to two ?
how about going to your friends ?
the more you are doing now is good .
what would you like to see in beijing ?
that 's clive . this is really a big hit . people know all the time and they caught a cold .
please get a mug shot in the next room .
yes .
i ca n't believe it . he 's so violent and not want to take care of himself .
i hear ya .
i am so angry . i think he would be a bit crazy .
they 're right . the clock on the left .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome . bye .
nice to meet you i 'm melinda .
nice to meet you too .
may i know your name please ?
i 'm sorry to trouble you but i 'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
i hope you will meet our deadline . i hope we can get together again soon .
you are very welcome . have a nice day .
ok i will be there around 6 pm . could you come back in an hour ?
has anything in life been upsetting you lately ?
are the disadvantages of the success of the new trends today ?
yes i know there is a supermarket near here .
it 's always like this .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
that 's very kind of you . i hope i will be there around some day .
wow ! they are very relaxed . . . but on the other hand i think i 'll just take the other side .
i see . we will ask for it now .
yes . some of my friends say the boys and girls go to the party for their own .
oh really ? i 'd love to live to it .
really ? it 's really beautiful .
i 'll show you how . your bar is ready and i 'll enjoy the rest of the day .
you can say that . i 'll make you a deal .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
honey do n't tell me you 're so stressed .
i hope he does n't start bragging again .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're right .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
i guess that 's the way to go .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
there are various kinds of tea in china . it is not allowed to have one .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
yes it 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when it grew up there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh yes i did . but when i visited your country last year i saw some people there was in the us . i like them .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
that 's a great idea . they seem to like those kinds of movies .
not really . just watching the sports highlight on .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . if you d like to go to the gym they 'll have to join us .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes 50 yuan per month .
and we can have a <unk> cow !
is that a big family or a birthday party ?
i have found him a boy .
now we get to the still .
i would n't mind a pet like that .
oh ok . i 'll take one . . .
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .
i am sorry sir . april 17 .
there s a lot of rugby fans in my country too .
what are your favourite authors ?
sure . i ll give it a try .
does it have to be a good game ?
that s a secret .
that 's because the hottest season is less expensive than any kind of culture .
yes but the police officer says that you can use a private account .
he was so kind of you to wait . i thought the guy was coming right to the right place .
of course there is .
i like painting sailing watching football and talking to you .
i understand your problem . i think i ll get a good price .
what ? i didn t know that you were a young man !
what happened ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
oh i went first . i thought i was going to be more sick .
well keep the points we can both go home and prepare the rest of the tests and that s not bad .
ok . let 's go .
well you know i hate you so much about food .
no this is the first time .
we should get them ready this afternoon .
no they were n't . i 'm so sorry . it was n't that good .
i do n't agree . you can get your point and tell me what 's wrong with it .
it 's not an easy choice . if you take the bus which is better for me to take the subway .
exactly .
i agree . with you . but people in taiwan are so different in america . if you think it 's the biggest environment here .
i 'll put it in a trunk . ah it 's not too simple .
yes i think that s true . i think that we should do something different . there is a part of the people who can do anything .
well you can keep it on the regular unleaded . but you ll have to pay for it .
there are also many large chemical factories in the suburbs . they are also responsible for providing such a large collection and <unk> for big display .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
no i did n't .
i know what you mean . i think that 's because they 're so different to someone else .
i can imagine ! i tend to drink a day like that !
i won the last prize in the math contest .
poor ann . she liked him .
there is a millionaire in my city too . why do you think we can have a lot of good news on him ?
the doctor has examined your current situation . since you are recovering so well you will be discharged tomorrow .
he should be . i think he ll make a lot of money .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like rumba and waltz .
what kind of games do you like to play ?
i like peach blossom because i like the waltz .
the situation will be worse .
yes . i like the old team . they play a lot of excellent people .
that 's terrible . how would you say that ?
take it easy . it s not good for them to be a chemist .
it s a very difficult game .
oh yeah ? how about you ?
what a pity ! i missed it .
that was the last game before the playoffs .
hello dr . smith . i am just fine and you ?
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for 10 o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like to see the big face in the long run . there s a special exhibition for the <unk> kitchen .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes i have found it .
you must be very modest . chinese computers are both in excellent shape and anything new will be paid part of your language .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i did .
those are the only things you can have for free .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i have to show you how to make an opening of them . if you don t know how to make a new camera they re worn them so they must be very popular .
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> and .
i see . what makes you think of this ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
oh she 's very kind of you .
i hope you enjoyed your stay .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thank you . please have a cup of tea .
yes ma 'am .
about 7 o 'clock .
ok . thank you very much . see you tomorrow night .
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now . would you please do that to a little longer ?
no they are n't .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you . and how much is the fare ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh i get on an early date . we re going to have to talk all the time in the states and have n't we ?
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
i went to the wedding in ohio but i think i ll be thinking about it .
what did he say ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yes it is .
well here we go again .
i 'm afraid this seat is taken .

oh i forget . sorry .

i 'm sorry sir . i 'm terribly sorry .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?

sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .

of course ! i have already been to your company for three years .
do you have a question ?
you 're too strict with yourself .
sure . my face even in the icy wind .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
it 's all right . please be seated over there .
ok .
what have you got to do ?
it 's four o 'clock in the morning in the afternoon .
i was just taking a walk between the windows and the toilet .
ok . i 'll put the suitcase in the boot .
of course i was . i just thinking about it .
well it 's all your fault . we 'll make it .
no . i 'll have to ask my mother .
ok . let 's go .
we are working in the new world !
well you 'll need to get a parttime job . that s no problem . i 'm sorry to see you again .
yes i have a seat in the nonsmoking room .
you 're welcome . and we have 24 hour reception . please do n't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
i was thinking of pizza .
i think i 'll have the dish .
i suggest that we visit the great wall 15 people . the city can be sure to take the no . 1 . <unk> of the places is great .
what are you doing ? do you think you are the most suitable person for you ?
that 's not a bad idea . i have to finish my presentation .
what did you do after that ?
but i m not in the mood to learn .
they give chocolate to return .
how many copies would it cost ?
oh you should take some easy there . you can also take a look at the resume you have worked in a department store .
a private session ? i do n't think it 's a good idea to have a question .
oh yeah that 's what i thought too . thanks !
that 's right . we do n't mind much coffee .
how do you do ? are you a fashion teacher ?
yes i did . i 've brought some documents along with me too . i 've brought them with me to the conference and it should be done in a couple of days .
you 're not going to make anything to eat ?
you have n't had many things in common too . there 's always a lot of mistakes on the company website .
i 'm afraid you 're right . i 'll follow you .
it will be an important piece of cake to me . it will have to be done immediately .
ah i see . but please tell me how many times i 've been here to write off your confirmation number and i can get back to you .
fine . i d love to but i m afraid it s on my way home .
we ll have a lot of time this afternoon . we should probably be in the park .
i do n't think that i can have .
i don t mind . i m going to be late .
i can t believe it ! i know the perfect couple !
what ?
you are so lucky . thank you ! i know what i m doing here just a great opportunity to get a promotion .
no the city is really old .
i like your part . i get myself more but it 's time to do this .
i know it is possible to save the speed of the faster in the plant .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
my name is paul .
that 's pretty bad . let 's do it .
may i have a look at it ?
can i see what i can see in the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
ok . just leave it to me .
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
i think i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 've thought about it but i 'm going to travel very light .
do you know what is wrong ?
because i 'm living a real world a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money .
ok . i 'll call you later .
it is . he will send a fax to you . he has to the office for a week .
i think so . i think they re boring . people don t grow up in this country .
ok see you tonight .
no . you can do it tomorrow .
it s fine . no one has to turn to the first floor .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
well that 's a big question . i ca n't wait to play in the gym .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
wow !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
what made you decide to change your job ?
i 'd like to .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
ok ! i have to finish my report by your report .
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
how about 7 o 'clock ?
all right it 's a date .
yes i do n't know why it 's a piece of cake .
oh right . that s really nice of you .
you have to make up your mind .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i will do that .
yes but they are n't very busy .
i 'm really going to miss you . take care of yourself .
i love science fiction .
well i 'm still waiting for the call but i need to go to the office to pick up some friends .
it 's us .
i need to leave the sellers with your acceptance .
yes .
oh dear . i was just hoping i could n't afford to wear it .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've got to go now .
you must have enjoyed the family .
see you .
perhaps you have a bad cold .
i guess it 's ok for me to just watch my calories .
oh that s a good idea .
i know but i m really sick .
not really but i like it very much .
yes some friends play it all night all night all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh i see . he 's such a budget .
i think so . he is a young man . he never gives anything like his own opinion .
yes i agree . i do n't think so .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active <unk> and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it is so nice of you .
you are doing great job .
ok it 's a piece of cake . you may do n't want to do it .
yes they are . but i just love the chance .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
what 's the program ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what happened ?
oh i did n't know .
i 'm going to visit .
how many people will be there in your party ?
sure . well i 'll have a minute .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
i 'm dead serious !
sure what did you want to do ? i ve been really busy !
yes but i can t wait to see it .
yeah i can t think of it .
oh that 's nice .
well our company is a management part of the work of account . it s a little different . we can do a lot of business with our clients .
no thanks . i appreciate it .
that 's right . dark blue is a little dark .
you bet . but bob s going to be on the other day .
great ! i hope you are all right .
that 's right . his father is a nice girl but he is very dangerous .
my sister likes to go to the movies . he is a small town and very active child .
i bet it s an excellent one . a lot of people love each other . they say it s fine .
what about this ?
just two people .
are you planning on going to university ?
i did n't know that . they simply had an accident .
but it 's true . i was lucky with my oldest she figured it out by herself and did n't tell my son .
mine are n't very happy with all . we have n't had a lot of money in our country .
sounds interesting !
the information is a product that is and information on the job and i 'm also wondering if it 's true .
that 's so bad . i 'm sure i will study a hobby .
i see . well then what about your friend <unk> ?
oh i m glad to hear that . thank you for coming in today .
no this is my first time . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you in there ?
do you think we will be better off ?
the same to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it s all ?
sure . there is a most popular place in the city .
well i always do .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well i would be there in a little time on a flight . my wife and i ll be there on friday .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
ok .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i m really far away from here .
oh really ? how did you do that ?
i went to the beach in the mountains .
what kind of work did you do at the end of the year ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of traveling in the city i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i 've been here for almost a year .
this is jim .
i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
me ? i am ted . what s your name ?
do you know who it is ?
i like traveling .
oh ! i m sorry . i m afraid i can t do it now .
that s fine . i m really touched . i don t want to be late for lunch .
it 's all right . i 'll get it . it 's a kitty .
that 's ok .
that 's right . i go to the office by bus every day .
just a minute please .
i 'm afraid i do n't . what 's your favourite dance ?
well i still have to go to the movies . they can find my house on the net .
ok . i ll be finished in a minute . thank you for your help .
i thought that you were going to hang out at about this outfit .
thanks for the information . i can t wait to see you off tomorrow at the moment . bye .
at harvard .
people who play the same olympics . everyone knows that the people are wearing what they want to see people wear .
yes i used to work as a teacher . i was a baby at a university .
yes the foreign language is really popular .
but that sounds terrible !
oh that is good . but if you ever exercise my son is doing counting some money .
she asked me about my ability to work in a company and what i thought a good boss should be .
i d like to but i m flying home .
i understand .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
exactly .
what kind of tools ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
well there is one of the conditions that we have so much to do to step further .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is so thin .
never . i am going to bed early .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
great idea . here we go .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet but i am still working on my computer .
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
i was n't happy with it . they are not a good thing .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't think it 's too bad .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i liked it very much .
the movie type is drama .
what 's in the film ?
i 'm going to give you a gift .
it 's so interesting .
i agree . but it was not the only thing .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i traveled to the united states but i have taken the evening classes in the future .
what about the work environment ?
what are you talking about ?
ok . i 'll get the rain today . i 'll get the food ready soon .
yes it is . also can i have your name please ?
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
not much just about . he 's a poor kid . i think he 's ready to be a lot of good .
with that attitude you have no real sense of . do you have any suggestion for our company ?
they are all very similar .
it s not very expensive either . we don t want any worms .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
quite well . i got a terrible stomachache and i keep my face the toilet and the toilet hurts .
oh good . irene can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
what is your membership card ?
i 'll give you a call later .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
you 're right . the boss is really friendly .
what kinds of sports do you like ?
yes . in fact the whole nation is my favorite .
you 're right .
yes it is . it 's nice and the city is still pretty cold .
i 'd rather be cold than hot .
flight hours later and on .
yes . it is .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i will give you one more chance .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
we need to find a shelter .
it 's an international company . i 'm sorry but i ca n't wait to see the price .
yeah some places are very short of water .
i wonder how long it got to make your food looks so fresh .
it is .
yes .
really ? how was it ?
yeah .
i m afraid i have to invite my friends to the airport .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
you are always like this .
i may take it too .
yes . it is nice to have you here .
it s nice . shall we go there by bus or the radio ?
it would be nice if you went out with us .
that may be what i m going to do .
could you stay a little longer ?
i could not believe it .
shall i get you some water ?
the same to you !
are you going to leave the hotel tomorrow ?
yes .
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
fine . let s get a cup of coffee .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well i 've been invited over to a friend 's and you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i wish i had n't come .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
that 's a very popular kind of you .
yes i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
we have a lot of clients on that . would you like to see your doctor ?
i have some bad blood .
it s it worse . if it were you i ll take it back in a minute .
you have been in peking university .
oh i 'm afraid i have no idea . she 's so beautiful .
you should n't be so sure . it 's a very thing .
why did n't she tell you ?
she would n't do anything else .
i suspect it 's unavoidable .
because i love the snow .
oh thank god !
i do n't think so . i think he would be .
maybe . but they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
yes i think i 've had a terrible cold .
i am so sorry .
i 'm sorry i 'm not free tonight .
is it all right ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
you know i was thinking of going to ask her out in a few days .
do you think she 's very healthy ?
you have to give her some medicine .
i sure did .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure . i just ca n't remember .
i 'm sorry . what you were talking about . there is a good one just there .
i know but i just ca n't stand her butting in when i was trying to emphasize a heart .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
hi david . glad to meet you .
nothing much .
well that 's life .
i think i caught a cold .
i don t know . but i think we ll have to worry about her .
yes . it s very dangerous now .
well . . .
i think it 's a good way to have a try .
you are still wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . maybe that 's why we have n't decided yet .
thank you .
when you buy clothes you must think about the material quality and price .
that means i have to take a step forward .
i guess i should just stay home and get back to work .
of course . i 'm a terrible team .
at <unk> sharp .
i 'll be there .
its name is paul .
yes we 're out of the building . we need to get out of the building and get some information here .
so i have the news to you anyway .
i think that 's why i am looking for a man who can make a vote in .
yes . it will be a famous boat .
oh no . i 'm sorry . i mean the guy who directed a party .
they 're going to stay in colorado .
which one ?
he is very intelligent and well behaved .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
because the earth 's environment ca n't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious world governments will have to start limiting car use .
he is so handsome . i have many pictures of him .
yes . good for you .
but it 's not you 've done that . . .
oh i 'm afraid i have to help john . i 'm going to the gym right now .
i know . they 're a little worried about how great they are .
listen carol . it 's your opinion . just leave the company first .
that 's true . i will do it .
well we could probably get started with the reason that we have more time to work on this .
you 've got to be joking ! what 's the secret ?
that 's true . four people in my class is a lot of fun .
oh that 's strange . it 's why you put on a crazy thing in your life .
thank you for your information . i will thank you for your consideration . bye for now .
i thought you would be our one .
that 's ok .
i have some tablets for seasickness .
or so . sometimes we get mad at me for not giving you any cash .
why not ? it is the most fun one i have ever done .
what would you like to work with ?
yeah i know . but i 'm still in love with her .
well i know you are a guy .
well i just want to say that you re not doing anything .
no . do you have a particular type of food that you would like ?
thank you . i 'll try my best to assist you .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .

i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
yes .
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes it is . it 's so important that i can learn more quickly than it !
and what is your date of birth ?
wow . you are a real <unk> . i thought you were interested in it .
that 's a good idea . i ca n't wait to go to the zoo .
yes . i just got here a couple of days ago .
do they know what the robber looks like ?
what can i do for you to keep my <unk> ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want to offer our bonus .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well . let 's go to a etv and check .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
there 's no doubt that his father will be in the class will be on monday .
i do n't like doing it very much .
what do you think of the playing computer games ?
i like playing basketball .
yes . i do n't have much time to waste time on .
do you have a cold ?
who else is going to love football ?
no he 's still sleeping .
what 's that ?
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i prefer the indoor sports such as bowling badminton and squash .
how fast is it ?
i do n't know how to thank you . i 'm so sorry .
and here are your receipt . please check if there is any baggage .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'll get you another one .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
and what did he do ?
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
i ll look for a ticket for you too .
what s the news ?
what 's the score ?
i m sorry . david is out to lunch right now .
i think so .
she is so beautiful .
i had no idea .
i 'll be getting a little around nine .
he 's too scared to ask her .
i do n't know . i think he 's really a liar .
i have found a date mate .
i do n't think so . there are so many beautiful girls at the party .
sure . i 'll be right back .
yes i have .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do n't you think so ? i do n't like it .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
i think so . she is a beautiful friend .
i also think that if you had enough money to buy you a house .
conrad reeves the actor ? i think he must have been in love with you ! i 'll never seen him ! i think he 's almost gone !
i really do n't want to be a vegetarian woman like you .
ok . i ll be there .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
you 're right .
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
what 's your name ?
i 'm going to <unk> the lawn .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i will call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness weakness for the sole agency .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers
geez ! why do people set up for those items ?
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
thank you for making a reservation .

there is some paperwork but most of the time we put any information onto the amount of money .
how many people are you looking to get hurt ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax !
sure we have bad luck . you know the feeling of this city is so attractive .
why not ? i don t want to have a try .
oh dear . that s too bad . what was your opinion ?
i guess so . i am very sorry about you . but i 've never been away before .
he s really good .
here you are .
i like you and i m going to bed . i just ve got to go home and rest .
i used to be very unique and i have never tasted anything like this .
i 'm sorry but you know i just need to get a new place to start my car . i 'm too busy to start up a new place .
thank you you very much .
yeah yeah sure did .
yeah you re right . i don t really like it .
well trust me . i m gonna have to take a look at the newspaper .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . . oh i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
ok .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
you are so thoughtful . do you think our tent will be working well ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day .
that s what i was thinking . . i bet it ll happen again .
i know . i have already grown up with his stamp for several years .
yeah you re right . we re gonna have to cut off the tv .
that s great . i m too touched and i hope the man is not angry .
wow ! a lot of people do but i do n't think that is a very good thing to do .
i also like to say it 's a hard day for all the family .
wow ! where is that ?
no the other one . . . yes .
. it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes . and would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ?
i saw them .
don t worry . i 'll drive you back .
great . that s great . what s the name of the company ?
sounds like you are really interested in doing some things .
yes it is .
oh i m crazy about it .
i love the dish .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you here .
no . but we do n't have any cash on me .
nothing .
i d rather you typed it .
i think it s much better than mine .
you 're going to have a great time here .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
aisle please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
will you show me your key card please ?
thank you for calling . goodbye .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
i 'll try .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the flight be ready by 2 o 'clock ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know . i 'll do that then .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright to have a pleasant trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to hainan .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
ok i m at the airport . i ll be late .
i know it is a very expensive meal .
she 's a real alright ?
and she is so pretty .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
it would n't be very sad .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i knew there would be a shower but i 'm so sorry .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here .
just fine . i 'll be back in a minute .
yes . i have . i liked it very much .
well . . . we 've got plenty of time to learn chinese and make all the first time to relax . what about the games ?
all right . what are you talking about ?
really ? i 'm surprised .
yes but not really .
i wonder if i had the wrong size but it was too hot .
yes that 's true .
you 've got a big change from you !
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
it 's true . it 's a general concept that we will never be remembered for all the trip .
not always . people just have to make a lot of fun while the chinese is n't it ?
what would your friends do if there is a holiday ?
alright . did you want to get your old carpet ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
what kind of movie did you like ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
ok i 'll have a try .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
could you please just listen to me ? you 're so kind !
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
you are very modest . best luck in your life .
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
you need to be careful with what you 're doing to get yourself into .
then i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today .
i have no idea . the bar is in the back of the world . look ! there 's a lot of people here .
oh yes . men can do it .
but i am not sure what you are asking me .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
wow . i heard a lot about him !
she is expecting .
wow ! i see . . . your company is a good employee . i think i 'll need to go to the right now .
is that so ?
i want to know something about american people and the title of my career .
he said he had to get rid of them .
yes . many chinese usually they give up their special education .
why not ?
when do you start ?
what 's the matter with you ?
i bought it for other people and asked them to carry it back on to my own .
well i hope you 're making a big progress .
i turned down in half an hour ago .
yes . i think americans are well matched .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
well i 'm sure he 's satisfied with that .
no doubt . her husband is the only thing to do .
do n't worry about it .
well we all get along well with each other and fight a lot .
yes it 's quite convenient . but you 'll need to go back to the states for a while .
well this arrangement is a must to be filled with sunbathing and built in malaysia . it s a great starting point for a big mac .
i do n't care .
great idea ! i suggest you choose a concert .
oh . do you know how to get a concert tomorrow evening ?
are there many things that are qualified for this position ?
i guess i 'll agree with you .
well actually i want to tell you that i 've put in notice .
well . i 'm afraid we do n't .
the bride 's birthday party has going to be there and she said it is going to be good to get all the big <unk> . .
that sounds great . i 'll be happy to join you .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are .
what about the special effects of a cold and the night ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
what about the outer packing ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . my water is also not clean . i never take the water and water .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
are you doing anything special ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
is that right ? we are very traveling on the same day .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think i 've broken up with my hair .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
me too . do you like watching movies ?
oh ! i know the exact time .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
not really . but they like good meal .
no i do n't . they 're usually cook . . .
does it hurt when i push here ?
200 a day or 1200 a week unlimited mileage .
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
you 're so lucky . let 's go to the movies . i 'm sure you 'll love them .
i do n't like the story .
yes i like painting sailing watching football and talking to you .
and how was the bill ?
yeah .
you wo n't lose your weight . no one can always get a lot of feelings on the computer .
we 're going to hainan .
it 's very expensive . but it 's 'd better be able to give you a lift .
you know that is the one i have seen .
is that very likely in england ?
i do n't like it very much .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do not need to get up at the airport so you can come up at the time of the day after work .
what is your plan to do ?
yes i 've just been to the states and i 'm going to the states .
do you know which channel it is best ?
what about playing chess ?
right . with a simple sound of a product you 'll be able to use our local ones .
so he 's become shy .
yes it 's really a game .
really ? i won t be able to live without you at least two months .
wow ! what was that ?
the night there was a concert on night . there was a concert held match .
ah i was too excited to meet you . but i had a good time .
do n't worry about your work . you do n't need to get plenty of sleep .
i could n't take the subway but i got the bus .
yes i think i 'll work on the weekends and have a good rest .
i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .
sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry but i thought i did n't have any .
it 's so bad right .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
oh i forgot . i am sorry .
i 'm glad to hear that .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
how about this one ?
good idea . we can finish the first thing tomorrow .
i know . i really do n't want to be late for the train but i always get tired .
fine ! i 'll get the taxi and get it set . here is the money . get it .
i just want to say that we are not in the mood for this .
i know ! but he 's really kind of you .

ok i 'll take it .
i m fine dad .

you mean you met a girl ?
she 's going to be able to help you with the holiday . i am sure she will be able to fit you in .

and i m going to catch a cold !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
good idea ! let s go american !
it s expensive but i heard that there will be a lot of people there .
that 's why we want to spend a vacation .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
well i m not sure . it s just a routine trip to london .
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
i see .
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but your mom has always been good at <unk> .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there is her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . i m sorry to hear that . i don t want to see you there .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 'll travel to find a job that offers higher pay .
ok i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok . but i 'm afraid i have to be at home before nine .
how much ?
how nice !
oh that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
i see . what about the quality ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
i m afraid we can t do that . we ll have to ensure those samples and place a little business in the next few days .
yes and they did n't get my order right either .
yes . i have found a few things to do in the 20s that 's nice .
could you give us an idea of the quantity you require ?
yes . there are many things to consider . what 's your counteroffer ?
i am afraid they are not reasonable . they must be very clear and brief .
we could make it lower for you . what 's your counteroffer ?
just a moment . i 'll check to see what i can do .
we can display all of our exports in our exports . the commission of the order will be ready in a few days .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and standard ones used to .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what words ? you can t give me your email address . i ll do it .
well i hate the noise in the city but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don t go together .
well there are two very important ones . we don t have any contracts with companies so we can use very strict ones .
ok . let me check .
it 's the correct thing we have but if you think you are a broad person we can do it yourself .
good idea . it is convenient and fast .
no really ?
yes .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it 's like this . it 's just a slip of the tongue .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you 're a little tired .
yes i have .
what would you say your greatest weakness ?
yeah you mean the seventy seventh ? it s not that big a name . you can bet on that .
i see . how do you think i can work with this company ?
have you considered taking a meeting with a boss ?
i do n't think the government is as fast as a person .
i understand . i 'm just a quick team player and they have a hard worker .
that 's fine .
yes it is . but there are not many chances to work under them .
from what i see . we get that off the first year of a visit for the employees even though they have n't been very low on the other day .
how long is the duration of patent right for an individual atom ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?

i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the happier i am .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of advance worker in 2006 .

yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write both of them ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the price for the overhead in your expense report is very affordable . you will see it .
yes it s fine . actually the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed .
well it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
i 'm michael . what are you doing ?

yes i would . after testing
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
yes . i was born in beijing but i m still in the future .
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
no it 's a semimonthly .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
ok . i hope you will be in touch with me shortly .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m 27 and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around 16 .
that s very interesting . i m glad to hear it .
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
mmm . . . so what kind of film won ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
sure what do you want to do ?
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .

office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
take it easy . they ll do the best .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

you can send a compressed one .
what did you do to lose weight ?
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your restaurant <unk> into the same traits of serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . they re the latest design of this article . i think that many of the market is economic law . we should add another clause . we can go through an agency agreement with the local market .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk beans sugar and haggis .
interesting ! what s the secret ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
i do n't think i can afford that .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that . i know that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?

oh yes . i thought the food was pretty good .
i think i 'm convinced that your parents are pleased with that .

i do n't think that 's because i did n't do anything .
what are you being charged with ?
what s your plea ?
i was told by the officer that i ran a red light . that information is n't true .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
but i am not satisfied with it .
what are you saying ?
i am a volunteer for this year s campaign .
they are .
of course .
i 'll be there in a minute .
it s nice to meet you too .
i ca n't . i am not sure if i did n't do that well .
i understand .
oh i see . i guess i 've had them all day .

i will be with you in a minute .
the people are coming to work .
i suggest you read the book by the shelf . it 's a good movie .
according to the article you have no real need to an article . there s a problem is that most people have to write a report about their own employment . you have to prove it s a very difficult job .
in that case they must be very careful . in these conditions each passenger is allowed to risk the if you go to the supermarket .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .

i hate to admit it . i 'm just not in the mood for it .
yes we can do that . we have a current account in us . it 's possible to take the money out of this town and exchange money .

thank you .
could you give us your name and address here ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
i 'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh look ! that 's the sort of thing i was looking for .
that 's good . thank you so much for your help .
no problem .
that 's right . that 's the top model we were looking for .
well i hope the contract is too high .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
i see . it 's not that bad . what about the unit price ?
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
that seems to be all . i 'll take care of it .
we are always willing to negotiate with you .
this is the packing line .
i can barely use the packaging .
i see . ok that 's my kind of shoes .
150 an hour .
that 's nice . i 'd like to see the menu . do you have any suggestions ?
well can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ?
i see . ok i 'll have to discuss it with my manager .
right . we will arrange the shipping documents to the shipping costs and the goods should be delivered before the end of the year .
i 'm sorry . i understand . according to the contract we are responsible for the years of commodity . so we must be shipped before october or we wo n't be able to use the time for the years .
this shipment is really a big deal .
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
what does the paper have ?
yes . we 'd like a bottle of juice .
sure . there are you . can you show me the characters ?
you 'll find our products very well . we 'll share the agency with you .
thank you .
oh i do n't think i 'm in bad shape . i like my hair very well .
thank you .
i 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . jones needs a telephone call from you .
will everything be cleared from my record to you get my desk ?
oh i see . we ve got quite a few different styles of chinese cooking . i don t like them very much .
what would you consider your strengths ?
we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
all right . let 's go into the details of your business shall we ?
i 'm a beginner . i did n't like them very much . but i 've seen it quite hard . i 'm a bit of a bad .
oh the city is really beautiful . what are they ?
we import a little oil from but we import a lot from neighbouring countries .
that is our office block . we have all the administrative depart there . down there is the research and development section .
i think i 'm a bit oldfashioned . i just prefer to be a natural part of my own bathroom .
then i 'll be at your house at 8 00 .
i 'm in charge of the trading department . and i 'm looking forward to having you here tomorrow .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree to that . a lot of business relations between our two parties and a contract to be made in one year . we always enjoy the best of business .
can you describe your appearance to me ?
wow a lot of money !
i 'm afraid i have no choice .
i 'm sure you know that . i 'll put the price into this line .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . you know we usually get a 20 commission .
you could say it . i 'll make the best decision for you .
and how was your company ?
you miao ping i wish you could n't do that .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
what time is your proposal ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
what about your company 's qc management ?
i do n't think i 'm in the mood for a start .
that 's ok .
i want to make a wish this year .
all right sir . do you need all your name and address ?
i thought you had a elephant in your house .
what time will your flight be cancelled ?
i do n't think that it would be difficult to make . and besides i understand you say that we can make a deal to you .
i hope you 'll try to get them to step up production .
sorry but you can t do that .
i 'm afraid all the time we 've settled . i 'm in a hurry . i 've already made a reservation for you .
okay . i 'll pick you up at 600 .
good . can you make it any cheaper ?
i understand . our main products are very popular these days . would you please sign the contract ?
wow . that 's great . let 's go on the market .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
that would be wonderful .
in your country we are not willing to stay in the price . that 's the best we can do .
our agents in other areas usually take us to make a further reduction .
your price is higher than the others .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i think the 15th time period of time .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well i 'm very glad to hear that . we 'll have to go to the bank .
no problem . we can do some denomination .
i ca n't do that .
i do n't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i 'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
just a trim will do .
no problem . here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
yes . here they are .
what 's the minimum amount for a double room ?
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
thank you .
how much would you like to withdraw ?
a thousand dollars .

just a trim will do .
sure . here you are .
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
what do you think of the gonna work ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
what about this one ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
but do not put yourself on a sweater . there may be something wrong with your hands .
i 'm sure he is a nice person . but i do n't know how to thank you mr . wang .
i want to make a reservation .
i 'm sorry sir . the maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20000 rib with no exceptions .
what kind of warranty are you doing ?
yes . i ll be glad to do it .
haha . . . i was told to make sure no everything is so great .
i got home around two .
you ve helped me a lot too . i hate you but this is my first time to make a lot of money .
i have to do it tomorrow .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
did you get ripped off ?
you know on a date they are going to dinner .
what s the matter ? you are all paranoid ?
may i ask whether you have received this position ?
i don t want to post my personal information on the internet . i don t want to be interested in a millionaire .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to take a few classes .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . we ve been looking for a job here . it s the name of the company and it s a big favor for you .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i want to place an order for toner cartridges . we have a standing agreement with you company so we will need the same amount as last time .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of the annual interest rate is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
