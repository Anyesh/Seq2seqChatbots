the end of this month .

i want to have a bath .
how about your future ?
that 's my style .
try a singer . it has lime juice and over ice .
yes . i think you 'll have the same size as you have .
the color is becoming more .

good . shall we discuss the contract now ?
no problem . but i am not sure if it 's not too late .
then what ?
it 's 530 by the middle of the 31 st .
we can hold it until one day before the show .
ok . how about the sides ?
i 'd like to have a beer please .
draft beer and cans beer . which do you prefer ?
could i reserve a table for ten at 8 00 p . m . ?
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please . is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
what brand ?
salt please .
yes please . i 'm picking out some presents for my children and wife .
do you prefer an appetizer ?
thank you .
well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
oh it 's too expensive . ca n't you make it any cheaper ?
thank you .
i 'd be glad to . . .
oh yes .
sure . let 's take a look at the battery .
sure . i think it 's very important to have people to take care of .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
it does n't matter . there was a subway accident .
no but i ca n't .
i will .
hi peter .
what was so bad about it ?
how about some fish ?
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
all right . i 'll send a larger to pick it up .
you can get a cheaper apartment if you pay it for the rent .
i will .
i 'm afraid not . the only problem is that i ca n't find it .
i think you should be more careful .
yes you have a full service .
what 's your name ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
yes . second as you are seated you have a great time .
how many nights a week is it ?
it costs ten cents a copy .
can i pay by card ?
i can try it on .
it does n't matter . there was a subway accident .
no but i ca n't .
well congratulations !
thanks very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
it 's my pleasure .
sure . let me get it .
i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
i do n't like the style but i want to get one .
well let me see . . . the pants in the picture are good .
i think the most important thing is you .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
yes i do . i 'm very happy about your present job .

then let me show you some . you have made a good choice .
yes i 'd like to change some money please .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
do n't you remember the race ? it 's the one of the best seller right ?
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
i like it . it makes me look younger .
if you agree i do n't have to go with you i think you 'll have to buy it .
maybe you have a point .
yes . i think a white shirt will be fine .
maybe you should look around for an outlet .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
what about the outer packing ?
yes we need a large number of webster 's dictionaries .
i know . what else are they ?
how much is a deposit ?
what is your membership card ?
yeah i 'll survive . but i heard that the dollar was worth it .
are you saying that there are a lot of things i should have ?
excuse me ?
i 'd like to buy a pair of clothes for my girlfriend .
i 'm looking for a job .
yes . let me get you a pair .
i do n't like the style . but i want to tell you that i like the style of shorts .
what about the divided skirt ?
it looks nice . how much is it ?
yes . i bought it yesterday but it was on the other hand side of the table .
maybe they 're right . but maybe i know the little thing . . .
oh you can take them there . they are about a dollar ones and 2 yuan .
well you can just throw him into the trash can as he was there .
ok maybe we can order a soup and a salad together .
ok . well here are some of our scarves . let me see . . . this is one hundred and fifty dollars . would you like to try it ?

ok to begin with !
i 'll take a look . hmm . . . well i 'll take it .
yes .

ok . i 'll have it ready .

i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
no i bought it .
what brand ?
it was n't for anything .
i 'll go down the immediately .

it does n't matter .

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .

here you are .
thank you .

it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
i do n't think i ever heard of that before .
how long does it take you to do the dishes ?
yes i have . there are many things to consider .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
i m just going to let you go .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
i bought a sweater from a store last year . it was the kitchen and it doesn t work .
i have already done that .
the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .

yes miss what can i do for you ?

medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
i 'll bet .
is she working in a meeting ?
what 's the matter ?
do n't worry about that . try it and see if you 've got a virus .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about an hour .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
do n't mention it . it was my pleasure .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean by saying ?
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i ca n't afford to miss the old people . they are both talking about anything new here .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing to go dancing with us at the party . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
i 'll be with you in a minute .
yes it is . you have an appointment with mr . johnson at 1000

i 'm glad you like the foxtrot . will the next walls be all right ?
but this year i 'm going to be a huge thing for you .

i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .

i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at <unk> s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .

i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars .
how can you do that ?
but i 'm not sure whether i can take it or not .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
yes i know .
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
the size is 2 . so if we charge a 10 discount we can give you a discount on the same size .
it just wo n't be that negative . you ll have to go home and take one more from the side .
great . i 'll take this one .
no problem . i 'll be very busy .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .

maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for 10 years .

today you get a 50 percent discount . they 're only 1 each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .

these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
what s the problem ?
how about oil or spray ?
yes i would .

can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
but i do n't know if they 're really cold .
they come from countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to go shopping for my vacation .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
you forgot it last year as well .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
it seems that way to me also .
our price has gone up sharply has n't it ?
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .

what 's your name ?
that would be great .
yes but i have to be going tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! i like the house .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
i get what you pay for . how much money are they ?
great ! i understand .
of course . it 's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
oh i 'm sorry . do n't you think we 've got an appointment at the next corner ?
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .

mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
i m glad to hear that .
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is convenient . finally it 's located in the center of charge you can park and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
200 a night .
i think i 'd better get a discount .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one will have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
he was in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop stop . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
i think it 's difficult to save money . if you smoke you can try to take a taxi .
hello steven !
wow ! what a surprise !
it 's not that late . can you help me to finish my work ?
very well thank you .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
tell me what you 've been doing .
i 'm so excited .
my pleasure . good luck to you .
see you later !
no they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
for about a week or so .
i understand . thank you for your help .
she 's a lot of initiative i see .
what if a surprise ?
yeah that 's the one . it 's only about 10 minutes 'walk from the nearest subway station .
that means that we ca n't talk about him .
but i have to tell him i 'm going to be late for school .
yes . see you then .
i 'll be there .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do . what is it ?
well i m looking to get a <unk> suit .
excellent ! we have the finest at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
i am glad you like it . i thought you were not satisfied with my experience .
no you have to . the car is free .
i m going to put this off for this match .
all you ever do is have a chicken breasts at least three or four o clock .
what do i do after i use the machines ?
fantastic ! can i bring your own photos ?
ok i guess it 's not good at all . we need to get some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .
cool ! i ll do it !
i m sorry . you have to take a wrong turn .
i 'm looking for a sweater .
are you looking for a small medium or a particular brand ?
hmm . i don t think i ll have a look at this one . what s wrong with it ? i need a polaroid .
are you kidding ? is he married ?
how about the second course ?
sure . walk along the way until you come to the traffic lights turn left there .
oh is it easy to locate it ?
how much are you looking to spend ?
how about taking a walk in the park ?
i don t know . i saw an buy a dozen of animals around the world . it s a special piece of cake .
. . . wow ! . . this is really huge .
i don t think that s a good idea . does it have a bigger generation of gold necklace ?
what 's it look like lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
yes i think you can try it on .
probably . i 'll have to put it in a safe place .
that s right . i m glad we re finally meet .
i think so . i am over with this beautiful quilt .
no problem .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice . our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of chicken breasts ?
certainly ! you are also going to have to sign up for those items and decide how to take them .
that s going to be 4 . 05 a pound .
oh really ? i ve already tried it .
no thank you .
yes . . . smell the meat in your mouth and choose the salad bar .
sounds good . okay that s it .
i m glad you like it .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i need to find out some more information for l c . i would like to send a registered parcel .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
that s a pity . i like it very much .
i see . what about the maximum purdy and rate any change ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming faster and faster !
what are you doing here for work ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen in ram and a hard disk with one . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . i have done the feeling they are the best .
how about the training course ?
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes i think i should be paid more attention to the safety of the company . i need to get my paper and pay for this .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
well i think a trim will do the same . it 's a little tight .
i think i 'll go and get a beer .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you .
damn !
hi . i 'm here to talk about my credit card . you see i 'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . i 've had my personal credit card for ages but my corporate one is new to me .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless <unk> and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
no don t have to pay it . and we ll throw in this pen or maybe you can keep it in the long run .
awesome !
yes i had a look around .
we will have to do this .
can you tell me something about your work experience ?
i know what you mean . it s really hard to do this in the kitchen . the problem is that it s really looks like we will have to put together a hat on your back and tell me .
ok you can ask the receptionist to follow the information that you might have to put in for more information . i can t believe that you can do it .
it is the most expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m looking for it but it s not as big as it is .
you can come to the high end of this year .
i am sorry . we do n't have many on hand today .
how about the information ?
there . it looks great don t you think ? i m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i m getting this beret doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks for reminding me . i ll get it fixed as soon as i get back to you .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
yes it is not so expensive .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
you know why ? the car is so small .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get a few new furniture .
i do n't know . i can get a motorcycle by myself .
you see . i 'm going to have to live in the flat with my parents and pay for their home .
it s my job .
the rent is 1500 per month .
that s way too much .
it s not worth it .
i can t believe it .
that s not enough .
what is it ?
would you please reconsider ?
let s go and see .
you can t miss that .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is prepared .
yeah my wife likes bargaining . i prefer to eat some chinese food but i do n't care whether they are of healthy or not .
i probably should go to the bathroom and a lot of people .
this is a happy tooth . it s my favorite .
an ordinary one .
an ordinary one ? i prefer the simple one . the simple one is natural .
i don t think the price is too high for me .
i ll give you a call tonight .
what about the features in your resume ?
yes . i like the design of this house . it s very cheap . you can try it on .
i want one .
the mirror is over there .
i prefer both of them .
great . the price list is three dollars a week .
yes .
this is the right place . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if the information on the internet ?
yes i can be there .
i think i can afford it . besides i had one to give up to it for a few days .
i 'm happy to hear that . i 'll come here for you now .
good . i 'll come back tomorrow and we can then discuss it more specifically .
great . i 'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
yes i think so . what can i do for you ?
let me see if there is anything i can do for you .
thank you very much .
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
let me see . yes it 's a little tight .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about 40 square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yeah it is . i 'm looking for a job that is because i 've never had one before .
i know . i ve always wanted to buy a newspaper for sure . i think it s pretty good .
i think you ll find the right place . there s a desk and there s the park nearby .
let me have it please . i 'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
that 's a <unk> suit .
i love the relaxing colors in the kitchen . they re very tasty .
the best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
i will take it .
that 's a big problem . they 're on the same plane and that i 'm older than remember .
it is common practice to offer and then have a counteroffer .
let s rock n roll .
i am glad you like it . i can come down and visit the summer palace .
i see . then i should take a look at the <unk> .
my grandfather 's breakfast . it 's a good idea . he took the picture of the room .
i like the house but i don t think we can move on to the climb .
i love the idea of the kitchen . let 's go look at that new furniture .
that 's right . we have all the separate rooms rooms available by air .
it s red and black .
this is the right place . what can i do for you ?
hi this is steven . i 'd like to buy a stock .
where are you living now ?
i have a great idea .
well let 's go there then .
i have no problem . i 'll let you know tomorrow .
we have a oneday trip along the river . it 's quite beautiful .
i 'll be here for you .
that sounds great .
thank you .
we might also have some catalogues of the new perfume .
yes i 'd like to change some money please .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i want to study in a while . i know i 'm trying to get a new one . i do n't want to get a new one .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly <unk> power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only
great . i 'll tell you what i can do .
yes .
what 's your name ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . <unk> and apple are the same thing .
i do n't want macintosh . i want pc .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't hear you . would you mind not be able to ask your name ?
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
what 's your name ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the students includedmost of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome . goodbye .
how long would you like your haircut today ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o 'clock .
oh sure . it 's really very nice of you to come here for lunch .
no thank you . i am just not particular about my hair .
oh sorry . you know it 's very cold today .
not too long . cut a little off behind and on both sides too .
do you like this style ?
i hope so . i 'm not really interested in it .
well i 'm afraid you are the right person .
not really . you are driving the tree .
it s time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
no i do n't know which one to choose .
what 's your name ?
well feel sorry for you .
i see . well you have to give me some medicine . it 's better than to try .
yes . they are a little nervous .
do you want me to help you ?
i 've got it . thanks for your advice .
yes . we re on the chair now .
the soft sleeper costs <unk> and hard work .
oh i see . well you 'd better take a look at the mirror . how does it look ?
how about sunday ?
oh you didn t know that i had a problem with that . but i told you that i should have both pay you and do n't have to worry about that .
so what do you say ? are you used to a new place ?
ok let s go check out the kitchen next .
ok i love that one .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that 's great .
our computer lab is on the first floor .
true . i know that .
let 's hit the whirlpool for a bit .
yes i have . you know how your house is on the floor . i am sure we can have a good time here .
ok let 's go .
is that why you wear secondhand cloths as well ? because they 've got character ?
where is it ?
i see . why do n't you ask them to buy the tickets ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
ok let 's go and ask him to put it in our box .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually when are you going to go shopping ?
ok . i will write a report about the perfect part of the campus .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i prefer sea food .
do you think of some chinese food ?
i am from taiwan .
why ? looks like you 're going to have to go for a movie .

i 've been here for two years .
when do you leave ?
yeah . i go three times a week .
you have your own vehicle ?
no i did n't .

do n't worry about it . i 'll have to get you there .
i know you should do better .

hi steven .
i 'm reading about a lot of books .
that 's wonderful .
i 'm not sure what i want to do .
just remember that you have to show your gratitude for this . it 's time to say byebye .
i won a prize for a year s olympics .
you like the food there ?
i only have one . i want to watch a few days ago .
well i think you 'd better make a wise decision . company will provide you with life insurance policy and other person instead of offering application .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got some serious studying to read . . .
you are so kind . thank you very much .
well i hope i can help .
i 'm in pretty bad shape dr . ford .
how about sunday then ?

my motherinlaw just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight .
what 's your major ?
i was robbed .
well . you know how hard it is to be a new place for you to make money . we ve always wanted you to have in one of those jobs .
oh you know today i 'm going to america to forgot my vacation .
i agree with you but i think he may do it .
i think i want to try a new style .
why does n't he say that ?
i have been studying english for eight years .
i understand . why ?
i 've thought about it i 'd go and get a flat tyre .
what 's your name ?
i have to go to work .
well i like the novels of dickens very much i have learned english in chinese translation and english . i 'm good at both teams and waltz .
what 's your favorite course ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
i suppose you 're right . i 'll follow your advice .
no but i could n't help it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy .
let 's go to a car . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
how about all of your <unk> ?
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people .
well i 'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go . remember to take your bag .
i will miss you .
what happened ?
i 'm feeling a little under the weather .
i know . it 's hard to do this . but you know i am thinking about meeting some of the students that are doing what they are doing .
i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here .
you 're not going to cook ?
what do you need to learn ?
i 'm doing well and you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm still in xyz company this meeting took longer than i expected . say to it that the office manager knows i won t be in to punch my card .
i like the food for the summer . and i have to go to the movies .
do you have any idea how much you want to rent a car ?
let 's just park my car in a better position .

i 'm still waiting for your invitation .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
thank you . i am very poor at english .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i hope you can show me some advice . i 'll try my best .
no you can only communicate with others fluently .
yeah i 'm very shy .
that 's all right . please do n't hesitate to say so .
i 've already got a ticket .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard yale the university of michigan and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
really ? i did n't know that .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh i see . thanks .
i think most people are quite different from the internet .
i love to paint it but i always want to paint the walls right away and make the walls .
i can help you . how do you need help ?
i need to put my money in the jar as well . and i need to find a suit to take in my suitcase .
let s go in .
that s right . so many in the united states get after all . they must have at the top of the islands .
you are so lucky to have business .
i 'd like to go abroad . i 'm not sure yet . but i 'd like to go abroad too .
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .
how did you get involved in any club activities ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
well i 'm very glad that you could join me . i 've been expecting this for a long time .
not at all . i see you and your family twice a week and i enjoy seeing my own friends .
she 's very nice .

it 's my pleasure .
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?
my name is bill . how are your lessons going ?

i am driving and can you tell me how to get there ?
what do you think we should do about it ?
true but i still have to start cooking at least twice a week .
i see . what do you want to be in beijing ?
i know you are quite different from your food . is that right ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i have n't gone to the club yet . but i 'm afraid it 's too noisy .
so he talks about the story and said that it seemed interesting to me .
yes but i think it 's fun .
so what did you do out there ? i mean besides you did n't have a good time .
i 'd love to . and what are you going to do this summer ?
good luck !
not yet . i was busy getting some more done .
why do you need to go to the library ?
how about a driver 's course ?
then you can take a seat .
it is . you know the four tones and the music is very fast .
in my opinion you must have been the best choice in the world .
i 'm going to take a look at that scarf .
and your major is english .
you 're so modest . best luck in the theatre !
i see . do you have some information for your company ?
did you do something wrong ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
you should n't trust him . he always tells us not to study for more than just to study .
you can always go to the convenience store and ask for a loan .
i see . well do you have any questions for me ?
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
we can do that . it 'll be ready by friday .
but you know if the state has its interest .
anything else sir ?
yes . i was n't able to keep my scholarships and grant . but i have n't got any certificate of interest .
let me tell you about it .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
what did i do ?
you did n't ? i thought you were taking the class again .
it 's so humiliating ! i do n't want my friends to know i failed !
i 'm a student . i 'm on a diet .
so you did n't have a chance to tell you . it 's not serious . you really should have a problem with your hands .
did you guys go on a date already ?
it was n't as good as i would have liked .
and a storm blew our roof away .
i do n't know . i did n't mean to be the third time .
ok . that 's a problem . do you want to shop a few of them now ?
i got a job offer from dell .
how do you think about hair ? how do you get that job ?
okay i see . thanks a lot .
hi peter .
who 's the bridegroom ?
it was fantastic but i 'm glad i could n't wait to try it .
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great .
what did you do after that ?
yes i am applying on the nine to get in sleep .
i 'll tell you what i eat and you ll have to give me a discount .
but i ca n't see the rest .
did you know that she 's a teacher ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
and ?
even her mom ?
i think you should make a decision .
i think they 're going to be about forty dollars .
i have to do some things and do n't go to the office by 9 o 'clock .
i hope so . the family must be very happy about it .
yes i think so .
i know that but you work hard all the time for me .
yes i did .
you are so modest .
i want to have a look at english language . i think i should do well .
let me see . . . the professor has definitely taken the tickets to the first sunday . would you like to go to a concert or a night of coach ?
i 'm sure you do n't have any more . and my mother wants me to take a class to teach you .
this is the first thing i can do . i am sorry i ca n't wait to talk about it .
yes he does . he loves the girl very much .
i hope so . i 'll have a try .
do n't mention it . it 's my pleasure .
no because my english was n't very good .
about two month ago .
i didn t realize that . but i think i could have the same problem .
wow ! it 's a good idea to pamper yourself .
he asked me about my ability to work in the company .
thanks . try not to be late . you are already in college .
he always takes attendance by offering classes .
i 'm going to go and get the study .
ok .
i m excited to be here .
i 'd like to go abroad . i 'm not sure yet . but i 'd like to go abroad too .
you re going to take courses ?
well i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet . i 'd like to take english .
how did you get involved in any club activities ?
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
well i 'm very glad that you could join me . i 've been expecting this for a long time .
hey i m a pretty cool guy i ll make friends . and i ll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . you know like <unk> or theater or something .
i want to find a book called gone with the wind . but i ca n't find it .
okay you 'll be at 6
the author 's name is the best player and the author 's name is cheng long . i think it 's a brilliant concept .

yes it 's really wonderful !
yes i think so .
i thought that is convenient .
umm . . . i need to keep up the thinking of a tiger woods and my neck .
b and i ve got all the news about them . as long as you can see them the secret at a time of day they can make things to remember all .
wonder why they do n't get so many new friends .
i agree with you . they are very simple . but they are in a very good office .
oh yeah how are you doing ?
what are you doing now ?
then you must be careful .
i m fine celia . and you ?
i m ok . i m so busy !
do you have a lot of homework ?

do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
ok i will try my best .
yes . what 's the next train to new york city ?
yes . we can do something else if you like .
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
she 's very nice .
i see .
yes he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
there are so many here .
oh that 's right . why do you say that ?
it 's there near the wall .
well here we go again .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
i had a really busy day . i had to go to the city centre and i enjoyed the train . what do you think ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i have a sore throat and headache .
what about ?
i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
oh is that all ?
yes .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i haven t thought about it yet . i go to the university of hawaii for many years .
i understand .
i m sorry to hear that . we need people to work as long as you do .
i must have confidence in that .
i could stand for that . there s always a good solution to the problems .
it s true . it ll probably be about the best of history .
i can t believe that .
that s so true . is there anything else that you should do ?
i think that s what i m getting for . i don t want to have enough time to worry about it by working .
he is very interesting and challenging . are you thinking of taking a class with him ?
very well .
no problem .
i need to return a book .
what 's the problem ?
i need to make a withdrawal .
did you check the periodicals section ?
i didn t even bother to think of that .
i feel terrible i really didn t mean to knock you over . my tire just and i lost control of my bike . really it was an accident .
most of the chinese dishes in this store are from mexico .
i 'm sure you 're right .
thank you very much . by the way where are the vegetables ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the pyramids are amazing ! they 're the most expensive !
you are right . what about the price of this page ?
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually <unk> at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a chance that you can try and see this building on your resume ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them but most of us just watch .
why is that ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i 'm looking for a job .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
can you show me which charges you re referring to ?
i do n't understand .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
you should know that already .
it costs ten cents a copy .
how much is the late fee ?
that s good to hear .
thank you .
well you need to fill out this form and we will send you a note to know as soon as possible .
i need to return a book .
what is it ?
what 's the problem ?
what 's your major ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
i 'll see .
i 'm still not sure where to go .
we will need you to know what your job is .
how would you like to pay for it ?
i could come in tomorrow afternoon and we 'll be arriving on next week .
i 'm not sure . i think i 've caught a cold . maybe it 's better if i go to a doctor .
what about saturday ?
we are at the supermarket across the street .
how about going to pay for it ?
must i bring some music for you ?
thank you very much sir .
that is great . i think we should work together some day .
see you .
but i was so tired .
i was taking photos of paying club members in new york .
what is the problem ?
i need to go to the dentist .
how about some zongzi ?
i 'm going to refund your money right now .

how amazing !
yes i do .
i 'm sure you know that i 'm not familiar with english occasions .
i 'm very sorry mr . bob . there has been a mistake . we 'll correct the bill .
here you are .
it 's hard to say . it depends on how long and how long does it take to get there ?
i 'm glad you told me .
if you give me your basic answer before you do the end of every month you should make your plan .
i think it 's a little . what are you going to do ?
yes i know . but there is no doubt in this box .
no problem .
i 'll pick you up at eight o 'clock .
i 'm not sure whether i can have the or not .
here you are .
sure . most of the time they have the library 's finding the house . they re welcome to our office .
well they 're very nice .
sure . you should go back to the interview of the interviewer and make sure that you do n't want to hear the information .
i would like to purchase it .
that s horrible . i 'd be glad to hear that .
i think it 's nothing of it .
thank you .
no not at all . it 's very important to have the job done . first you should do your your presentation . then i can send you a short period of classes .
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm going on without you !
which class ?
they are all right . they are the baby .
the second part was that all of the time it was difficult to remember .
here 's your ticket and change .
by the way what 's the time of shipment ?
i really appreciate the offer but i must decline it .
i thought it was a bit strange but i really want to start a new system to you .
no problem at all . i was similar in the last prize of the national history contest .
the usual things . you know what we need to know .
i 'm not sure if we ca n't make the decision .
i used to be a big difference but now i 'm getting old enough of course and my new job is n't it ?
everything 's going to be set . i 'll just come back next week .
i 'll meet you at the gate round about seven .
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i really need to call you back .
if we do n't go on a day we may take a taxi .
i have been a project manager for several years . and i have n't had much experience in the past two years .
you really think so ?
not really .
thank you .
well done .
i see . . . and the chinese teachers also teach me english .
we 'll have whatever you want .
i 'm sorry ms . smith . i really need to call you back .
you should know what i 'm looking for .
i 'm a student . and i 'm very interested in the job .
i want to know about the fees .
why do n't you take the test ?
but you 'll be able to tell your decision before the end of class .
why don t you try it on ?
they are all very reasonable .
what 's your favorite course ?
yeah . do n't forget to take your advice .
you can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
my washing machine is n't working .
what s the problem ?
yes i have it .
what about cash ?
i 'd like to do that .
i ll just cancel your account right now .
thank you .
thank you .
there you go .
what ?
what is the purpose of your visit ?
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
but i really ca n't accept such a thing .
that s okay .
because i want to hear the truth .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
no i don t think she will do such a thing .
i can t wait to see him .
sure . but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun while he is a scientist .
i like its color .
i like the pattern and try it on .
how about this one ? it 's very latest .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
i really do n't think you 'll like it .
because of the film the most popular boy in the world 's favorite .
i agree with you . but it is not the first time he is angry with himself .
maybe you should get some rest .
i know you are a hundred percent beautiful and you are a good learner .
sounds terrible ! how much is everything going to cost ?
yeah .
but it s friday . you ve been there for almost two weeks . you must have won t be much longer than your month .
i m sorry sir . you ve made a good choice . here it is . take a look at it .
do you have a lot of money ?
have you made a hotel reservation ?
that s true . but chinese people think it seems that way to stop smoking .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
maybe they are shorthanded in the kitchen tonight .
great . then i 'll just tell you what i should do .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry i thought you knew .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i thought he only liked to go dutch .
uhoh here . . .
what 's your aim in your plan ?
you do n't know what happened ?
it does n't matter . i 'll tell you .
i thought you were interested in it .
so what do you do for yourself ?
you are cooking !
how did you know that ?
on the floor i bought it from the macy 's at the santa anita mall .
really ? how can we get it ?
exactly it does .
oh these glasses . they are the latest fashion form .
yes it 's a bit tight in the waist .
do you have a white gold card ?
i think it looks like it should be on sale .
are you serious ?
can you give her a telephone number ?
i think we are well spent together .
there was a stop sign ?
i 'm just in the middle of something . i feel a little nervous .
i hope that you can do better .
i 'm a friend of mine .
well you can come to the right place .
sure . she 's really a famous friend in america .
hi linda i 'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
she 's a friend of amy . we met at amy 's birthday party .
yeah . who s that ?
i like her very much .
oh shut up ! she 's such a touching girl .
i feel sorry for her .
i am so happy that she 's doing okay .
i did but i ended up with another few of my friends from work .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
yes . who 's calling ?
maybe we should n't have tight schedule so i think the line is to pick up .
i can understand . what 's wrong with you ?
i can help you with that .
me too . do you have all the questions about them ?
if your son starts to buy video tapes he ca n't keep them with a long time .
you 're kidding me ! everything is never gone . i 'll take it .
what would you like to see ?
what happened ?
we 'll have an appointment in half an hour .
no . is there anything wrong ?
yes i know . i 've had no idea i 'm afraid i do n't .
no not really .
yes i did . can you bring it to me ?
how many classes did you have ?
how did he do that ?
i see . i need to get some cold medicine for my family .
who is your favorite hip hop artist ?
i 'm not imagining it . finally i got home and looked at him . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ?
well it was about the best of yourself . i decided to put away your pressure in the store . you know i m not a child .
oh it 's too late . is there anything i can do for you ?
ok i 'll have his call you back as soon as he gets back .
i 'm sorry but i do n't think we should be happier .
i 'm so sorry taylor . go talk to her . i 'm sure she 'd be happy to see you .
which one ?
it 's an easy way to get . the drive takes off houses to work . we 'll just have to check the problem again .
well the air line is much more predictable than we had planned .
i 'm so sorry i did n't think about that .
i 'm so sorry i did n't catch her .
you mean the boy you met on msn ?
yes i do n't think i can use any of the <unk> .
cool ! i ca n't believe he is so stressed . he is so stressed .
they must have just come back from the flu .
sounds ideal . we 'll start to go to the hotel .
i can tell you at that time .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
yes i think so .
no this is the first time i have been in china .
i 'm not really sure . . .
uh dad !
sure . i have to get up the car once a week .
a dime is sir . you 'll have to pay for it .
i 'm getting a little short on cash . let 's just window shop a little .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
yes but i doubt if i get it . i 've never get it .
how much do you want ?
no .
i hope so . do you have a cup of tea first ?
i really hope that i could go there . i have to go now .
i still ca n't wait .
you really did n't have to go on the honeymoon !
yes you 're lucky .
that 's so nice of you .
what was that you just said ? you know they 've been out of luck !
you re welcome .
i will ! i could use some good luck !
all right . why do you choose our courses ?
i didn t get accepted .
how about the second part ?
yeah . i think it 's a good deal . you can give me a discount on the price .
that 's really nice .
i 'm a guide . i 'm having some basic tasks first including clothing shoes and then i 'll meet all the place for the summer sales . and then i 'll show you around a week .
do you want me to take a look ?
yeah i 'm . i 'm going to quit my job and i have to be on vacation now .
not at all . it is very kind of you . i 'll have a glass of wine .
what kind of soup would you like ?
no no thanks . i 'll take care of it .
i 'm here to see some id like a passport for example . how about a credit card ?
good morning . can i help you ?
i think i will start my trial if i am hired . when will i be getting a raise ?
so i can see by your resume you were coming for us at your annual next week ?
do you offer any other consulting services ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
oh i thought you were playing with a guy at the beach .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
you re doing anything for me !
well . i think my present job is better than that .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
please handle future shipments with more care .
what a pity !
i m just going to give you a ticket .
ho no !
i 'm still hungry but i 'm sure the restaurant is still there .
do n't stay up late .
we 'd better take a taxi .
ok . hurry up !
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my razor ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the <unk> .
that s the best part .
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
what do you think ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is 17 . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean by saying ?
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i ca n't afford to miss the old people . they are both talking about anything new here .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
that 's a great idea . let 's go to a bar and enjoy the fresh air .
good . let 's go now .
how are you ?
it was me . i am so sorry .
what are you going to do now ?
i had to move it so that it is not a cheap one .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
well there was one thing .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well you really should have another drink .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the radio ? what for ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
you 're a good idea . let 's go .
i see .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is n't a <unk> ! i have to be in rome by five .
i was late for school .
you knew it was a cold . i just couldn t stand the man talking to you .
what did you do ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i need to return a book .
no problem .
i need to go to the dentist .
do you think i can get up in time for a walk ?
no no that 's it . it 's just my nose .
how about drinks ?
i 've got all the cords plugged in but it appears that i 'm offline .
well here you go . we have some rose .
well i 'm glad that you have decided then . do you want paper or plastic ?
we hope your cooperation will be much better .
sure . i 'll have a try .
here you are .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
no trouble at all . so long .
we have all of our coffee .
i love you too . did you like the pattern and gown ?
yes here you are .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
not today . did you have your passport with you ?
you can change the money in order .
it 's a little too big .
but i have to be back by nine o 'clock .
it is . speaking . how can i help you ?
i want to speak to some questions about your financial situation .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
i believe there is a run at the neck .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
i understand .
don t worry about it . i ll treat you tonight .
that s alright . i see you later .
oh i 'm glad you 're enjoying it .
does it always close at six ?
we should n't put up with more of the staff .
is the officer that pulled you over here today ?
well i m just waiting for you to start from the next few weeks . is there anything else i can do for you ?
how much is it that ?
i don t know ! this stupid old car started white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
why don t you tell me what you re talking about .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated .
sounds good . how long is the tour ?
it s hard to say . we need to start the beginning of next week . we need a new car .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i just had a bad day yesterday .
i was looking for a book on chinese history .
can i help you with that ?
incredible . by the way what are these in the plates ?
you know that i care for you . ii m proud of you .
can you put it off ?
you think ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
it s on sale for 80 .
do n't worry . you can enjoy yourself .
thank you .
that was a great shot ! you made a move on !
is there a lot of traffic ?
oh really ? i 'd like to do that for you .
oh shut up ! it s unbelievable ! you are so kind .
i 've got to go .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
yeah i am going to be a new student or i may have a plan for my husband ! i m taking a break !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of <unk> ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from per to how many children on average the
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
i know exactly what we 're talking about ! i just want a a business trip with some people and our boss that 's really safe !
well i just want a trim .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an <unk> would look great on you !
um . . . no .
and a company car .
it 's great ! will it be hard to care for ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
i m glad you saw someone .
i m not ready to see the game . you re yapping on about your new clothes !
i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been on since the first !
i see . how do you feel about having those fields ?
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
you are so lucky .
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
how about all of your questions ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! little jerks .
do you think you can finish this ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
you re going to have to put on your bill . i think it s still plenty of room .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
i know but really it s pretty serious .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i m sorry i can t help it .
i am not certain about that .
i think that s gonna cut it off a red light but i think it s better to get the bottom bunk . you should be more careful about what i bought .
i think it s gonna be a good idea because i think it s better for a while . i m trying to get the money from other big yard .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you sound like my mom . look at that woman . you know i 'm going to quit after we .
you are so pessimistic !
what are you talking about ? i just want a talk with you about my best friend .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and <unk> of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like .
yes .
my friends ? fat ? what about those <unk> you call friends ?
it 's just that i 'm an oatmeal and toast and toast .
relax ! just turn off the stove and we will put in a couple of minutes .
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
do you have a lot of options ?
well they are very easy to avoid . if you are and willing to keep them from doing whatever you do . you have to be a them .
yeah i thought you were just doing something .
hi jack and i are back to buy a few things .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the dentist .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
but i still love this place . it 's made of wood . and i know i will go to other stores .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was <unk> . for me a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
do you believe what you do for a living ?
what 's up ?
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
no . i have n't . my wife and i have to be a volunteer for the next two weeks . she was really surprised to answer the news .

i love you . and i think you re awesome .

no problem . i 'll ring you up over the phone .
i 'm sorry sir . but you need to wait for a few minutes .

i see . i think i will .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
how to use a standard room ?

i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
is the park close by ?
yes .
after being raised together men and women can be businesslike in each other . it really is an amazing way to work with people .
it is very quiet and peaceful .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
i really think it 's the most important piece of cake for a picnic .
then we should look at these trees . that 's a great deal .
yes i did . my family and i went to tahoe to ski and the weather was great . do you want to go there ?
it does n't matter . i just feel a little tired .
i 'm very glad you told me .
i see . is she your teacher coming from the school ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
he 's got a promotion .
well i 'm sorry . but he must be now .
no joke !
i believe they are just about two things .
i think you re a great learner .
the ones that are on the shelf but do n't you remember ?
i guess you 're right . so i guess we should n't put up with some competition in this country .
you can always make it a time for the day or a day for work . it 's only about whether you like it or not .
you are such a good father .
sorry i 've got a bad cold .
sure . what 's up ?
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i like spring best .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance .
do you like playing table tennis ?
so what are you doing there ?
thanks i will . see you on the 7th .
what about this one ?
the <unk> is excellent .
i 'd rather you stayed in the same hotel .
i can do it for you .
a friend of mine was the best choice of sightseeing in china . the only thing i 've been able to carry the business trip by millions of years .
that s all right . all the time we met .
we jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
i see . by the way is there a rush for you to help me with the baggage ?
yes .
but that is not the best thing to me .
yes i mean it .
i 'd like to see you then .
i do n't know what i am doing !
let 's sit in the back .
it 's a little small but we have seats in the back in the back .
and what does he do ?
oh hi mike . you 're such a fool !
yeah it sure is . so it was the first time i am sure we could n't make it .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
that 's right .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
i just ca n't help it . he 's a liar .
hmm . i think i should have brought the red tape with this new camera .
let me see . oh we have a printed computer for you . that 's a long time .
congratulations !
i 'm finished .
how much is it made of ?
did you hit the camera ?
she 's pretty easy to get along with .
what about his back ?
i agree . he was also a great cook .
so what experience do you have ? how did you get started ?
i 'm sick of doing other people 's job .
merry christmas to you ! mr bean .

i 'll have a picnic with my friends mum .
i was thinking of taking a walk .

the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .

ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
literature and economy .
i do n't think you are introverted . you know those women are very smart to take their children to magazines .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
it 's gone with the wind .

really ? but that was a very good idea .
i hear that some people can live without using public transportation .
i could n't agree with you more .
why do n't you try to use wooden cases ?
no one has ever checked him .
is that right ? but you 're quite the same .
i m not joking . i have to take my word with it .
yeah i do n't know what to say . but i have to get him up to the same day .
yeah . i was missing you also .
yeah i agree with you . i m sure these things will be a good match .

they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .

hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
sorry .
they are all very experienced and great . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
how are your experiences experiences in this job ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .

no please feel free .
what do you do in order to improve your english ?
oh yes .
please be seated .
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
you are quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
it 's a kind of pop and so on .
no i do n't dance . and i do n't dance much .
oh yes . music is a good way to dance but with a few guys play .
that 's all right . if you do n't think you are introverted or extroverted .
that 's interesting !
i think so . the most important issue is that they can climb up the five .
but is n't it the same in korea ?
generally speaking meal is the most common theme in america .
that s interesting . i m wondering if we might be able to do some work on it .
i think it 's just that the leather goods are in the eyes .
you are right ms . yang . you 're designed to make the success of <unk> .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't make it .
yeah . i love it too .
well how about the museum of modern art ?
that 's a good idea . this place is nice .

i 'm glad you say so .
yes i 'd like to .
do you sing ?
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
do you often dance ?
yes how about rumba and waltz ?
what about your performance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day but the presale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?
yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
i am sorry but i need to write a letter to write it to your daughter .
i agree . maybe i should try to buy it since the last time was n't there .
i didn t get accepted .
you must be very popular among men .
no . i like to golf dance .
your life is so clean .
yes . it 's a nice evening .
while we 're at the club we 'll go to a great italian restaurant .
do you have any hobbies ?
it 's very nice .
what do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
thanks . i 'm glad you say so . oh the music has stopped .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor <unk> .
oh well the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
i like variety shows .
then what about the expression goodbye ?
no but there is one on the other side of the road .
quite right . now a lot of the rules are to play .
i think so . let 's go to a bar and have a look .
what kind of visuals should i use to support the presentation ? do you think i should use powerpoint ?
yes it 's even worse than yesterday .
i 'm glad you let me taste it .
that s a good idea . how much is it ?
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's very pleasant .
what about my height ?
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
it 's nice .
i am not surprised to hear you say so . tell me what you like about this .
yes the weather is nice and fast .
yes . it 's really cold here too .
i like the weather . it 's nice .
i think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window .
it 's going to be sunny tomorrow and we have to stay in the morning and rest .
are there any seats available ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i see . well then where 's the parking structure at ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
great ! i have a lot of information about the city life there . it is famous for its private park .
that 's true . i love winter and i love flowers .
that 's fine . let 's finish it .
yes . it 's really cold and windy .
yes .
i remember now . i met you last year .
well take it easy . i hope you will be more careful next time .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not a problem . don t worry about it .
i ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
i 'm glad you could come . i have enjoyed my stay and i 'll be able to help you with that .
i 'm glad you told me .
sure what is it ?
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
it 's time for a picnic .
that s good . see you then .
yes . i have no plans .
we 'll make it tomorrow .
i 'd like to .
i was thinking of going to the cafeteria .
oh do you have a club card ?
this morning . i mean . . .
ok . let me check . yes we have got your ticket and passport .
thank you . goodbye .
it is a great way to keep them fit .
i love it ! darling you re kind .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
some people are quite new cars . they do n't have a lot of public transport do n't you ?
i 'm trying to send the instruction book by email but i failed many many times . and there is something wrong with the net maybe . it 's so slow .
so since i bought it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it last time i saw it .
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the phone turns off by itself .
that 's right . i just want to build my room myself .
no thank you .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
well let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
you re welcome .
you re welcome .
you are so annoying .
i want to pick up my parcels .
really ? how did you get that ?
yes he is . and i think he loves her husband very much .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
it s my treat this time .
well you know i was a fool . i mean what you said just now is the same for a black women .
then i 'll try to avoid the same excuse .
i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
ok . if you do n't excuse me i can give you a call .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to .
i 'm afraid i do n't have any time to waste .
i 'm not . you know i 've been thinking of buying you somewhere before .
they re like a big wedding .
who 's that man standing next to her ?
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
you too !
it 's a pleasure . hope you ll visit us again soon .
it looks delicious .
i hope so too . thank you for coming .
i hear we ll have a new english teacher this semester .
you re welcome .
that 's a good idea . when you are in university you might know how to do your homework .
i know . but i just want to tell her that she s very interested in your ideas .
yes .
oh you know she is quite a teacher .
you can just throw out the garbage and do some exercise ?
i 'd love to . it 's such a beautiful place .
ok let me see what else is on that day .
i know life is not all roses and i believe i will pull this through .
it 's important to have the meeting room to be sure . the problem is that the whole purpose is to take care of your family and school will be happy to help you during the day .
in that case i think a slow office is not allowed .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
i 'm glad you told me .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i was . i watched the movie edelweiss do you know ?
you re so right . you should have picked it up .
it might be the most fun of the day in the future .
the complaint rate for a new product is very high almost eight percent . it s really large .
how do you think of this industry 's outlook in five years ?
which brand is it ?
i know but i am not familiar with the color and the color .
it 's made in jingdezhen .
very interesting . and your promotion was more interesting than your years .
yes . but he is not a girl who had the right to learn .
are they ?
please fill out this form and i 'll take it back to the box .
well i hope you 'll like your thoughts to be able to learn more from your operation .
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
first i heard that we get together to put our stuff in the registry so the realtor knows i can do is give you a list of things you want .
i could n't agree more . if you have more questions and more people are free to do .
sure . let s rock n roll .
yes you are right .
i 'm glad you told me .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you can say that again .
no . it 's not very much .
i think i know the little . it was written in chinese zodiac .
i 'm sure they 're all handmade .
i know i 'm little nervous .
yes they are . i was n't there anything . not a great time .
oh gosh ! i ca n't bear to look at it !
they were supposed to be completely different .
i can t find it .
i don t think this song was the best choice .
sure i can . what do you need ?
yeah . how about a nice place ?
the last bus will be here in four minutes .
oh i usually only go to the school . it was at least five of the school .
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly thinking it 's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result i was like what ?
thanks a lot .
i need to do some things .
alright . i 'll be there around seven .
she 's in the garden hotel .
when did you last see her ?
i think about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . would you like to go there ?
she lives in the suburbs .
yes i did . and on the top of that i went to the red hole with my friend last night .
how long have you been on the bus ?
yes i have one .

yes they are .
yes .
it 's difficult to learn . but i think i can help my abilities .
really ? i hope that she does n't like it .
yes she is .
is it very cold in the cold days ?
what 's your plan now ?
oh it s ok .
i think we should do this more often .
thanks a billion .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin . he likes smiling .
how did you learn to improve your english ?
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he 's 20 years old .

i ll but i have to tell you .

i 'm afraid to hear that . have you been to the united states ?
yes i 'd like to .
i 'm sorry .
no . i will .
well i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
what 's that ?
yeah .
no i did n't . did you go to the concert ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front 200 for the middle and 50 for the back .
i 'll get my things and meet him .
i do n't have the foggiest idea .
yes . quite a few months ago .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
it 's supposed to be good for you .
what are you thinking of a library ?
well we offer a 10 charge for our members .
the early bird gets the worm .
how about all of your questions ?
he 's really reserved normally . but from what i hear he 's got lots of problems .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?

you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
would you like to have a look at the ticket ?
i love it . why do n't we join a club ? we can play together and practice chinese .
i 'd love to .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?

i do n't know but i do n't know the name of the american team . what 's the name ?

i was hoping to go out somewhere for two weeks . how about friday ?
i know that is we should do something for our family .
i 'm so sorry . i wo n't be working against you .
yes it is . and there is also a walkin closet .
my mom says it 's going to be a lot of fun .
you have to be patient . it is really very funny .

why is that ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .

yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
i think so . it 's a great party .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
plenty . i live in the middle of the summer and i get up in the hills .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes . beautiful .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay you are a dark cloud over there . do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i would like to know all about it .
are you serious ? how about your family ?
whatever . have you got all the dishes ?
she 's pretty conservative .
you have got wonderful news .
tom that lucky guy .
he s fine . he retired last week . it s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
that s interesting .
not bad .
i heard that we moved to someone .
he s been feeling pretty ill for a few days now .
how long is he doing ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
yes i know . he 's a hard worker .
maybe he 's abnormal .
you must have the wrong number .
you can only play a lot of movies .
it sounds interesting .
yeah but she looks amazing .
i mean i understand that .
i would n't do it if i were you .
but i 'd better not .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i know they are not all that but they are all handmade . you know i was just doing what they were .
i was denied a visa ?
not too bad .
i think you are just a child .
how can i help you ?
is that true ?
yeah you are right !
certainly . . .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
you have to catch it .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
<unk> is one of them .
so are <unk> and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if there 's anything i can do for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just <unk> that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am <unk> with work after 10 day holiday .
how many did you spend on holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
i see . how did you know that ?
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
i know . he just made a perfect husband .
you are right . he s the boss s eyes and one girls are always trying to marry his wife .
i am quite familiar with windows and think i am fit for the job well in this field .
how can you be so sure ?
well there 's no limit .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes i get it .
do you think you can get along with them ?
you 're sure he is .
but when he back that 's not my fault i 'm sure he will understand .
what happened ?
thank you .
i 'd love to bring a few days of week with me .
he said he had to be our monitor in the class .
yes . i have them sent to you immediately .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
when i m here to see you go . i ll have to take you .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i bought it from macy 's .
well i am sorry to hear that . now you 're making a deal .
i think it s broken .
we are . we still talk about the language as we were .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's too bad . i 'm sure there is a logical explanation for it .
no wonder you are so interested in it .
it seems you two are a really judge .
do you have a lot of homework to explain ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm sorry i thought you knew .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
how do you feel about this ?
can you live with me ?
then i 'll try and give you a chance .
i am sorry . i didn t quite hear that .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
yes . i like her husband and i like her very much .
i like that . they re not so fat .
i like slim girls so i doubt that it is very popular among chinese girls .
but chinese ?
thanks . i think i should go and have a look at the same girl .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i think so . there is no doubt in my mind .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
not bad .
can you tell me about your educational background ?
a party of 13 .

i thought you heard .
i really need to go to panda express for my chinese food .
she s sitting under the tree .
how do your children get to know ?
but those ads are very difficult .

you did ? that is great !
yes i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

we have to do it .
i 'm sorry to hear that . could you please drive a little ?
i think that they are really a naughty boy .
what does she have ?
some people are shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
yes i see .
you mean finally we could get back to nature ?
i think it s because of the fine arts .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have been to choose hilton hotel business for two years .
he is a lawyer .
you need n't be careful .
it s true . and he is a big fan of theirs .
no it s fine .
oh that s too bad .
i ll try my best .
you can also take a bird <unk> suit and a pink tie .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
what about the radio ?
no way ! you know what really happens and me the money they forgot to tell them . and i just bought you a new one . no kidding !
no problem .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
ok . i ll fill out the form and come to the rest of the week . i d like to see some mandarin and hot dogs .
i have something to eat . let s go to the restaurant and see how you feel .
yes we are .
how many nights a week is it ?
in the spring .
how about summer ?
we have thought about it .
oh your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i 'm calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday 10am in the hr manager office .
i 'm going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes i have n't decided yet .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you mean you got a higher idea ?
i guess so .
yes i did .
can you come at 10 am and see me there ?
yeah this is the kitchen .
i think it 's a good idea to have a nasty experience . i 'll say it 's been a nasty boy .
i 'm doing well and you ?
pretty good . how are you ?
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . did you go to the concert ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot .
how much was the ticket ?
the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front 200 for the middle and 50 for the back .
let me show you the way . please follow me .
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
what 's your name ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
i know . it s going to rain for a while .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
it 's a pleasure .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
that s a good idea . but i m afraid we can t do it .
try a car wash and selling candy .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid you 've made a mistake . this is your first time to be in the driver 's license . how many years of english are you ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
it would be very useful in international trade .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
i do n't think i was wrong .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
you have to buy a ticket first .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
i was wearing jeans and a new dress .
let s see . you bought a lot of television too .
no can i take a message ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
oh hi .
pretty well thanks . and you ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have to go to the movies .

thank you .
good evening mary . it s so good of you .

hi steven .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
i m very sorry . i can t make it .
i will miss you too .
i am not sure . i do n't like the song very much .

i have a sore throat and headache .
sure i ll be there .
yes i am . i opened an account with you about the years ago and i have been looking forward to this job .
i also need some sunscreen .
that 's great . we have been looking forward to going somewhere .
yeah . why not ?
certainly not . you should also put on a dry cuff on you and a reading .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
we 've got a lot of them . we 've spent 700 for dinner at one hour and it 's still waiting . i can wait for you .
i understand .
here 's your ticket and the change .
well i think you should have more babies !
this job is more essential than i am working in the company .
well i have no plans for the next year so i m hoping to move out to the u . s . we 'd like to go to a job in .
why ? what are you interested in ?
no but i 've got to go for a walk in the park .
i would be glad to .
you should take their advice . they know what 's best for you .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well what about your sister living in boston ?
how sweet . what if you are on a modern family ?
i know i need to learn that but i did n't have a very hard time finding a place to hire one . living in a big house is n't it ?
oh just two people . how about six ?
do you think you are a good husband ?
i know . they know they 're going to be on the other day and they do n't have enough time to make .
really ? what did you do ?
it 's of good news . it seems we are the same in the field .
sounds not to me !
the information is for the job ads but the people in the future !
that 's so bad . i did n't know you were working here for so long .
i think it 's time for you to change your mind . if you see the white house we can go for more . it will be more convenient to make you in the future .
oh very interesting .
yes i know them . they are my mom and sister .
what is that ?
i think you can say that again .
ok . i can have it . you haven t been there before .
no wonder you always look a big fan of him .
i ve got it from the wall . i m glad we are going to have a look at them .
i m afraid not . our chinese girl found out they were so different from each other .
how about this ?
yes i do . i m learning chinese now .
really ? do you like it ?
sounds like you 've got something .
wow . . .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i understand .
i know i need to learn how to apply for it .
how about you ?
you are smart to guess .
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
really ? how often do you go ?
yes . i went to the cafeteria and bought a new house .
how many credits would you be paid for each year ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i sure did .
oh wonderful . was your family a wedding ?
i have a lot of them . i also like to drink milk and a cup of tea .
i m afraid i can t . i just hear you re so kind and you sound like a good guy .
it was no big deal .
yes i am . i find it very interesting .
how about having a game of bridge ?
about 10 hours .
do you do any visitor or do you go with you ?
for sure ! we are going to be married in the same country .
that s true . but i m sure you know that this is the best way to learn .
why don t you go to the police station to find out if you have more experience .
you can always wash cars and sell candy .
i m sure you ll enjoy the trip .
you should go and do something else .
well we could go to a movie or something . you could get some exercise too .
oh . did you know that he has to be his lawyer ?
no i was busy getting around seven thirty .
do n't you know the name of the old song ?
master smith ?
well i am going to be a soccer team as you can see that on your hands . what about you ?
you are so lucky !
are you doing anything this weekend ?
me too . no more than you are .
do n't you know what you mean ?
in winter i think the weather is more important than the old .
i do n't know . i 'm a big fan of swimming .
yes i know . is that right ?
well yeah you are right . i just want to know what you re talking about .
that s true . i m going to have to take the first break up .
i 'm not sure if you have any questions .
me too . i am not the only one who has to be the highest in the english class .
dad i m getting ready to start a couple of months trying to find a place to help .
that 's true .
but it is very difficult to learn the staff from the americans .
i see .
actually i m not good at both chinese and chinese . chinese usually only need them for me .
well i do n't have any type of exercise . i just go to bed and get some exercise to keep fit .
i love the art exhibition ! it 's a really interesting story .
what are you going to do when you 're in college ?
has anything changed to it ?
that s how much these days i have to pay for .
do n't ask anyone . you can never tell anyone about my real programmers .
yeah ? what if we 're going to be able to get into the company ?
i think they 're a very good choice .
i 'm still not sure whether i can recover from it .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
hey look over there ! we should go .
i think i 'll get a hat too .
do n't worry . we 'll talk about it next time .
why not ?
elvin does n't tell me what to tell you .
not bad . how about you john ?
and i suppose i 'm doing more weight . and my hair is n't good for them .
what ? you did n't ? oh no . . .
and she 's received by mr . wang i 'm glad to be his wife .
i have no idea what you want me to do .
it s this tuesday .
what s the special rate today ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
i thought he only liked to listen !
it 's really a good excuse . they said that they should give their advice .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
that 's right around five nine five ten .
i hate to tell you that but was anything . they ca n't do anything about it .
that 's right . you can see i 'm not worried about that . i do n't know what to do .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up .
i know . i was prepared to talk to you later .
do you have the receipt with you ? i think you need to show me the receipt .
do you know how to set up the timer ?
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the brazilian team versus the american team . do you know anyone has the american players in the back ?

well you are really a <unk> friend .
i don t know .
do you know that yellow means slow down ?

but i heard that she has been very interested in the us .
well i do n't have any idea .
what 's the value of the machine ?
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
cool ! we should do more exercise .
well the garbage disposal doesn t work we have rats and the toilet is backed up .
absolutely . he makes the ticket from the grandfather 's estate in the city .
no i did n't . did you ?
have you seen his house ?
i promise you what ?
oh yes . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very much .
i am so sorry . i did n't know .
sorry . i know the rules .
what did i do to it ?
i see . thank you .
well we could visit more places in the southern part of the city .
yes .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
yes please . do you have any ideas for this position ?
yes i see . now let me give you some details about the loan .
i am glad you change it to me . i will be able to make it up my business but i need to take some medicine for it .
yes i see . do you think i can fit you in at the ladies room ?
that 's fine . i 'll have to work on it .
yes they are . there are too many people . some are told told them not to try to quit smoking but it 's not so bad for them .
yes of course . first you must have had an excellent time . second of all you sold out of the car . we provide a position with all the managers such as credit details of these items in the company .
good idea . i 'll get some too .
no . if you do that the workers won t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .
i 'm so glad you enjoyed our great time . but i 'm sure you will have a good time .
you do n't have to .
i am sorry i ca n't .
yeah i think i will .
are they ?
what 's the weather like in beijing ?
that 's it 's clive of course . where did you come from ?
and the winner will help you with his hand .
yes .
i ca n't believe it . he 's so violent and rather than watching .
i hear the way you keep your promise !
i can t believe it ! i think we are just that we can t do anything !
actually the classes have some good jobs .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome !
oh very nice to meet you . i 'm irene .
yes . how are you doing ?
nice to meet you too .
good morning sir .
i hope you 're right . i hope you will have a good time to visit us .
well i hope you ll feel better soon .
that 's terrific . thank you for being so understanding .
i totally agree with you . the best way to keep in the life of the company . there is more traffic in the city .
are the financial control trains being used to take off the street and off the pollution ?
yes i know there is a big grocery store in the shopping center .
it 's good to have people coming home . let me know how you feel .
i 'd like to .
i will be there . do you think i can make it ?
sounds like you 've got some competition . you want to be on your own .
and what about the training course ?
yeah . these are gradually losing their appeal .
i 'd like to try it .
really ? i ca n't wait to try it .
i 'll show you how . he 's good at swimming . does he play much tennis ?
you can say that .
i 'm sorry .
honey be patient .
it must be tough . and it seems they 're all handmade .
if i were him i would give him a good talkingto . i would insist on his stopping <unk> around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
in that case i guess the ten is now worth the price .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
look at the tea table in the corner . it is much better than the corner .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
that might be a great idea . do you like those boring movies ?
there are different clubs near the city centre . many of them are from my office .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
of course . if you don t have to go to the cinema many people will definitely follow the game .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
all right . here s the receipt . the price tag is three dollars and 50 cents .
give him a happy birthday gift to tell him .
i 'm afraid so . he is very cute and brave .
i don t see the idea . it looks like you re in the blue .
do we have to pay extra charge for drinks ?
i would n't mind having one day at least .
oh yeah . i 've got it . here you go . i 'm going to take a look .
i love it too . why do n't you come with me tonight ?
i do n't know . maybe you can come to the bar by friday .
there s a large number of people who play it s worth watching .
what are the purposes of contract ?
i ll give you a special shot of cake for you .
what other activities does the same ?
you can see the flames or <unk> in the math tests .
that 's not the only thing you can see is that .
you can remember that one of the conditions of the bread is limited in the area .
he had no idea a lot of bad things .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
i m very fond of playing pingpong .
you 're right . i guess i ll get a little faster .
i see . well you have to get a few pointers if you can t use it . especially you should have a good steady throat .
did you have a fight with the tickets ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
yes i did . i thought i was going to be more careful .
well keep going up . i ll put the table in a few minutes .
ok . i 'll just have a drink .
i m sorry to hear that . . i ve got a lot of emails to be able to help me !
no this is the medicine for the stomach .
well we should get them ready this afternoon .
no i did n't . i 'm so sorry .
i suggest you buy stocks then .
at least you have to have a very good experience .
exactly . instead of increasing their work .
i agree . with you . i do n't want to get any kind of exhibits you want .
well i 'll send you an application form and then we can go to the bank together .
yes i agree . i think that is making sense of people paul . i don t think that is the only way to do anything .
well you can buy your own ticket for a full refund .
there are also many small chemical factories in the suburbs . they are also responsible for providing such service and transportation .
yes . that s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
i sure did .
you are a good friend .
i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i think i won t be taking up a course like that anytime soon .
i think he might do that .
again ?
there s a lot of information about our home system . what s he like ?
the accountant of course .
you think it s just a crush . you know they can be fired in different shape .
not rally . 200 years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i like almost all of them but i prefer to classical music .
what kind of sport do you like best ?
it s hard to say . i think .
the couple of people you 'll find a guy who should be able to come around and drink .
not at all . the chinese team has been very hard .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
who s the director of your family ?
come on . you can play too much or play ball .
that s not for me . i can t remember .
what ? you are so pessimistic !
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . over the last few days .
have you got a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . he can t decide which to take us to the hospital .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional <unk> .
sometimes the men wear colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
yes i have found it very much .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of the university ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
those are the same thing .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
i can t think of who they want . what else do you have for christmas cards ?
i don t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they re <unk> <unk> <unk> and .
i see . how do you intend to do this ?
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
yes i like her .
are you also going to beijing ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
yes it is . i ve come through with some colleagues that are already changing because i never know how to express myself .
yes i 'd like to book a table for four at seven thirty .
about 7 o 'clock .
for how many guests please ?
yes but not really we prefer red wine with meat .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
thank you very much .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
so what kind of chinese food do you usually eat ?
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there s no variety in our lives .
what do you mean by us ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
i was born in beijing but i came here for visiting it .
what did the nurse say ?
i said do you need any help ?
what did he say ?
he said he saw my information on the internet and could offer me an appropriate job .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah . it 's even noon .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
yes .
does it suit me ?
how many copies do you need ?
hi jim . have you heard his new computer ?
well i m a college student . how about you ?
what are you studying ?
i have a test tomorrow .
what 's the purpose for your visit ?
yes .
yes that 's fine .
thanks but i 'm full . we seem to have decided to .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
why did you choose to go to the law school ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
yes i am sorry .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
i said do you need any help ?
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
i promise you that i will get the contract ready for the first half of the year .
my date will be fine .
you 're too strict with yourself .
not really . my face turns into a red light but it 's a bit too plain on its own .
never ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
it 's a pity .
i will .
what did i do ?
it 's four o 'clock in the morning .
i 've got a sore throat and i think i 'm coming down with a doctor .
how long will it take to get them dry ?
yes i have . i 've been having a big wedding with my parents for three years and i want to be a big dinner party .
oh sorry .
yeah and i have a lot of homework .
why ? you ca n't .
we may have been in touch with our old friends and join us in the afternoon .
well you have to go to the police station . that s not a problem . i can help you fall asleep after school .
yes i 've got it .
it 's my pleasure .
that 's great . i 'd love to .
let 's see . the charge is extra .
well i suggest a trip around the corner . it 'll just be more convenient and warm .
what are you doing that for ?
that 's sounds like a plan .
what did you do after that ?
what s the matter ?
they can only give me their financial aid .
what about the home inspection ?
take your resume with you and trade . you can also get some of them to the students who are in need of help you .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
oh yeah that 's what i thought . thanks for asking for my grandpa .
that 's very generous of you . i will enjoy working with you .
how are you ? i 'm glad you learn to learn .
i 've got it . i 'm glad i did n't have any trouble with my credit .
you must have realized somebody was here .
you have all of the things in your family ?
how do you get along with the american students in your classes ?
it will be hard to get the truth .
ah i have n't seen you for ages . how could i tell you ?
i m looking forward to it .
we should also go out more frequently .
i do n't think i can have .
i don t want to . i don t want to have any money .
i can t believe it ! i know it s going to be hard to get away from you .
what ?
it is so beautiful . i wish i had this chance to tell you what i am doing .
so are you enjoying it on your own ?
but i just ca n't forget him .
then what do you think about our financial situation ?
i was just thinking about it .
it s a soccer match . it s only playing the field of bees .
it 's not an easy job . it 's pretty much cheaper .
may i have a look at it ?
can i see the rainbow ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah it 's just that i have to admit it 's hard to tell them the truth .
ok . anything else ?
yes .
i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i 'd like to get a ba but i do n't know where i should go .
do you really think we are met two people ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
ok . i 'll have the letter of recommendation .
do n't worry . he will be safe .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
ok next time and we are going to have to get all the things done !
no . you should n't get hurt . try it carefully .
it s not a problem .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
well i am not really in the mood for a drink .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame <unk> !
whoa take it easy there . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
sounds interesting .
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
but you must be joking . the job is very nice and he is a manager .
i 'd rather you did it .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sounds good . where can i come over ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no i do n't want to use any computer .
really ? me too .
you can always make up your mind .
no i was busy . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i will do my best .
yes but they are n't very busy these days .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
i think i 've heard .
well i 'm afraid it 's too hard to tell .
it 's possible i wish to talk with you about this afternoon .
you are going to need to fix the pipe to take care of .
yes .
oh yes . i 'm thinking of wearing a new dress .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i 'm sorry i ca n't .
you must have enjoyed your stay in town for a long time .
see you !
you have lost a good diet .
really ? i guess i should learn more from it now .
oh . i just saw a recipe for my mother .
well maybe . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner .
not really but i like watching .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
oh i see . he 's really a little depressed .
i think so . he is a sensible scientist .
i know . it 's boring .
you 're right . but i think i 'll go for the match . the only thing i 've got is to do is to be a little nervous .
then you can go to the training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
you have to do something romantic .
you are right .
sorry . you 'd better say that again .
yes they are .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
what are the best ones that i should do ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
i m not really interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what are you going to do ?
oh right . i almost forgot about it .
we are going to go to visit these gorges .
i 'll talk to you later .
yes . well maybe you can tell me what you want .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application form .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
i bet you will .
i will bring you photos as many as possible .
my aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now and she wants me to give it a try .
i wanted to but he said no the way . can you help me to clean it up ?
but you may have told me you were working with him .
i didn t think about it . but what if you were you would go with me ? i ll have to go .
yeah . that s expensive .
i like to work in a different area . i will try to get into more and more information about it .
no thanks . i appreciate it .
what is that ?
i think you can say that again .
ok . i can have it . you haven t been there before .
no wonder you always look a big fan of him .
i ve got it from the wall . i m glad we are going to have a look at them .
i m afraid not . our chinese girl found out they were so different from each other .
how about this ?
oh just two people . how about six ?
do you think you are a good husband ?
i know . they know they 're going to be on the other day and they do n't have enough time to make .
really ? what did you do ?
it 's of good news . it seems we are the same in the field .
sounds not to me !
the information is for the job ads but the people in the future !
that 's so bad . i did n't know you were working here for so long .
i think it 's time for you to change your mind . if you see the white house we can go for more . it will be more convenient to make you in the future .
oh i see . you mean a little bit too .
no not at all . just go to the interior .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
what are you doing there ?
do we .
the same to you !
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
it s me !
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
not at all . i m very excited about it .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
that s all right . thank you .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
i would be glad to talk to you about that . we will have a nice holiday on friday . tell me what you are doing .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
certainly i will .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've heard that most people in england are paying the rent to live in better .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay s hard work and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs 15 . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
really ? how often do you go ?
yes . i went to the cafeteria and bought a new house .
how many credits would you be paid for each year ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however on the third day of travelling in the city i felt sick i think i had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
i sure did .
my name is jane . i m jane . nice to meet you .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
this is me jim .
do n't be that negative .
well i ve always been here for 3 years .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know . i ll be late for work because i m late .
yeah . but i m really tired .
it 's very popular you see it that way . it 's a different story .
that s alright .
that s right . i go to see my sister and i drop by at her .
let me see if i can find it .
i 'm glad you like the foxtrot . will the next walls be all right ?
that s a good idea . you can always find a good one .
ok . here you are . is there any limit on the advertisements ?
i thought that i m going to come out with her .
so i can talk to you about it this afternoon . i hope you ll be able to get some quiet activities in the afternoon .
at least i have been busy with my food .
i agree with you . i m going to have to find some fun and do some traveling .
yes i do . i m learning chinese now .
really ? do you like it ?
sounds like you 've got something .
wow . . .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
i understand .
i know i need to learn how to apply for it .
how about you ?
you are smart to guess .
what kind of tools are you interested in ?
that 's not enough .
oh you 've already grown up son .
you bet it ! we are in the same boat !
you see we are fast .
never . i do n't have to do that .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
i m not too clear on the way to the chinese city . there are many indian thai and italian restaurants .
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet dad . i am watching my class .
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
i like the song you hear now .
i was n't interested in the position .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't think you 're right .
yes but i do n't think it 's too far to be a problem .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
i 've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend 's house . so i quickly called them on the phone .
the movie type is drama .
what 's in the film ?
i really do n't think you 'll like it .
because of the film the most popular boy in the world 's favorite .
i agree with you . but it is not the first time he is angry with himself .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i thought i would .
impressive ! so what are you doing to do with the job ?
what about the tennis part ?
i guess we can get ready and enjoy the rain .
yes it is . but you must be very tired .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it 's not too bad . he has a lot of good records .
that s true . i think we should add our legs to the market .
they are subject to hard training .
i don t like it . i don t like the way that it s in a discount of the city .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure . is there anything you can do for me ?
yeah . let 's do it .
haha . i understand your position . still it 's hard to get a raise .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
what brand are you doing now ?
no i mean that we 'll share the price in the world .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to tom we 'd have the wedding in the etv ? he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
look at the flowers over there . they are beautiful .
what 's your name ?
yeah . it 's a good way to keep fit .
you are right .
i 'm afraid not . it 's the four days in new york .
i think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . would you like to help me with that ?
it is best of course . do you think there are many famous places for the entire country ?
are there any seats available ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i 'll give you some more information about it .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
that 's great . we can go to the bathroom there .
you have n't seen the film ?
that s true . but i love being cold and i love being cold in the winter .
i wonder how long and fresh it is not fresh .
it is . it s not so complicated .
yes i am from guangzhou .

yes . look i ve never bought a new one .
i m glad you like it .

it s it going to be worse than it s it seems that everything is it .
what are you talking about ?
i do n't think so . she never allows me to make us kids stay on my own .
you should n't say that again . it 's a very thing for you to get out of the hospital .
why does n't he want to be interested in himself ?
i think she is really going to like her teacher though .
what does she look like ?
i 've been thinking about this for several months well before the spring festival holidays .
thank you for saying that .
yeah . i think he 's really a brilliant scientist .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .

well we have nicer things than that in this company . you will find out soon .
you 've got to be joking ! it 's the teacher 's right to say anything wants and if he saw her something .
that 's true . i think people who are on a <unk> basis .
it 's true . it 's when you quit or do you need to quit ?
ok i will repeat it very soon . thank you again .

yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
anything else is got on the couch ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't worry . we have another week but do n't get upset .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .

yes i like the old style dance such as waltz rumba and so on . they are quite graceful .
what kind of music do you listen to ?
i like playing the piano .

oh i 'm sorry .
oh peter .

why do n't you try it and see how you feel about it ?
well control is really using common sense when we plan your eating habits .

how fast is the cost ?
i really do n't know how to use it .
i 'm going to need to see your id .
oh i 'm sorry .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the <unk> has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the <unk> throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
and what about gonna come to the game ?
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at the bottom of the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fifth <unk> here at richie stadium .
well i have the day off from work .

he 's too scared to ask her .
i do n't know . maybe they know what to say .
i would love to .
i do n't think so . there are plenty of fish in the sea .
sure i 'll walk the car and come back soon .
yes i would .
never ?
do you have a more active edition of that ?
i 'm afraid you 've got the wrong extension number .
i 'm not sure . but she probably wo n't be able to find a girl .
i would love to see you there .
oh . . . i thought he said what you said . do you know what he would do ?
i would n't say that . you worked hard like that .
i have to . i have to be there before 17 o 'clock .

not a bit . what can i do ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
do n't worry about it . i 'm sure you can do it .
i 'm going to the mountains with my family this weekend .

no i did n't . i saw an x moves even displayed .

yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
i mean we could flip a coin for it but i would probably win again . i 'm incredibly lucky you know . it 's pretty tight this time .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on and fed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it me .
impressive ! what about you ?
well to begin with gambling is ruins marriages destroys families and communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start
geez ! now i have to start a vacation !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !

the initial amount is just 2000 .
when i branch office open the company i have heard that the address of the company will reimburse you . will that be ok ?
i said is there anything i can do ?
we have the same problem . there is no doubt in the long line .
i can t think of that .
i see .
i 'm so sorry . i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
he s a very good guitarist .
great . i m on my way out now .
i like playing music . i should go with you . i m pretty excited about going out to my game . i hope i can make you some time .
yeah i remember that there is a real reason why i never saw such a beautiful girl .
i believe you 're right ! i never thought about it !
thank you . it is just a routine board of people .
yeah of course ! we had a lot of fun .
yeah . i m really sorry .
well i understand . why not ?
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i do n't know . maybe we should go and look for something .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i 'm sorry .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i know . it was the first time i saw him . he was a psycho .
no it ca n't have been that bad . what if he does have a crush on you ?
i know . i m sorry but i really need some help .
yeah you re right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . i know you re doing anything tonight .
great thanks . i m looking forward to seeing you at the same time .
wow ! it must be a very dangerous job .
i also like to tell you that it 's more than the most popular thing we have to work with .
don t worry . i ll help you out .
no the one next to it .
. . a perfect piece of cake !
yes that 's right . and here is the mirror . do you have your receipt ?
i got it . what are they ?
you 'll have to try it .
oh . . . do you have any practical experience ?
understand you are right .
it 's not a surprise . let me see . . . yes she 's a single piece of cake .
oh i m sorry . i ve never heard of that before .
i love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! mmm ! mmm ! it s almost lunchtime . i would die for a plate of stir fry right now !
thank you rick . we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel <unk> is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
well we 'll certainly miss you in boston .
no . i was thinking about buying a secondhand apartment .
i think this is cooked up by mistake .
i sure will .
i heard it 's about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars .
great ! i 'll see you at the same time .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
what happened ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about visas you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
an aisle seat please .
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
that 's ok . i 'll take it .
thank you very much sir .
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
do you like it better here or at pcc ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass and take a roll call . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why not ?
yes i 'll try . i do n't think so . i 'll make sure and come across the office .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
how much do you think i should spend ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
yes i know . i will try to get this finished at the first thing tomorrow morning .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?
it s become a beautiful city but i think it s become too <unk> . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i m sure you ll find it .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess i should probably just have a try . i do n't have any money to buy a new one yet .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
i m sorry . i m late .
i m pretty happy living there .
she 's a real alright ?
how about her name ?
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with his hand .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
i 'm so sorry . i do n't know .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad i could n't wait to try it .
where did you end up going ?
we went to europe .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
yes i did . do you have the list of all the things you want ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . what about you ?
just a minute madam . i 'll get a tee time .
i 've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend 's house . so i quickly called the movie .
how about the lyrics ?
all right . you have to do is work on american airlines . but you have to be sure you would lose some time before you show them to be punctual .
really ? i think we 've helped a lot .
yes and they also have to pay attention to the safety of the first half of the month but this month it is worth it .
i wonder if i received a good job and this is my first day .
what 's that ?
you 've got a big change from her .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
it 's true .
absolutely . people should think about it .
what would your friends think if they 're married ?
alright . do you want your cuticles cut too ?
i 'd love to the movies are hit .
why do you want to come out ?
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
but tell him your phone 's late .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
you could n't do anything about it .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
you are chinese .
you are making me feel really discouraged .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
that 's true . the world is becoming more and more popular .
that 's a good idea . when you 're in rome do as the romans do .
i 've got it . the general name of the teacher is responsible for the general and he 's here .
oh yes . chinese is a traditional opera star .
are n't there any more .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
wow . i heard she was a beautiful wedding but i do n't think she would be single !
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
i see . thank you so much for your help . i 'll think it over .
so what do you do for christmas ?
i 'd love to bring a few days of week with me .
he said he had to be our monitor in the class .
yes . i have them sent to you immediately .
i 'd like to but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
when i m here to see you go . i ll have to take you .
here is the room . do you need anything else ?
i bought it from macy 's .
well i am sorry to hear that . now you 're making a deal .
i think it s broken .
we are . we still talk about the language as we were .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well that 's too bad . i 'm sure there is a logical explanation for it .
no wonder you are so interested in it .
do you have a credit card for me ?
do you have a lot of homework to explain ?
yes . i 've been here for 3 years . i would like to get some .
well i 'll celebrate a picnic with my friends and have a great time .
i know . but i really do n't like the place .
i have a great idea of what you need . can you book the room for me ?
great . i love it . hey it 's a new one . it 's a great idea to play with us .
are the most convenient in the apartment ?
i think so . i do n't want to be like that .
it 's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
ok . can i trade my table first ?
sure . the happy birthday cake they have all the most and then make them happy .
that sounds great . i 'd like to go for the birthday party .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
how do you feel about the rubik 's cube or solitaire ?
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
our few days are not very fond of winter and the weather is very changeable in your city .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the are clear again .
how about the second floor ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that s right . they don t have enough time to land on the coast . the coast is very tasty . there are also many small islands off the coast of the coast and many of the coast .
impressive ! so what are you doing to do with your windfall ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i know . what are your favourite dances ?
no but i ve only retired . it s a lot in the world . we ve been to the east coast and canada have more than one year .
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
exactly .
exactly .
buses are more cramped and you can t walk around .
exactly .
hmm . . . i think i 've broken up with some of them .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is it cold in autumn ?
yeah you can play the piano well .
i told you that we will stay here a little later .
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
not always . but they like good meal .
no i do n't . i like milk but i do n't like them . they 're much faster than eating .
yes you are right . i wish i had a great time .
that 's about one hundred yuan .
i am going to the store to buy some fruit .
that 's a good idea . what s on tonight ?
i 'm sure you have the same feeling . you look for me .
i want to enjoy the movie so i do n't think it 's going to rain this time .
yes i like music very much .
i think that i need to see a credit card please .
i am not sure . what do you think ?
well do n't worry . the baby has made a lot of mistakes on the job .
i think i will go abroad . my wife wants to go to egypt . i m not sure i will have a good time here .
oh i 'm so sorry . but i ca n't remember the reason . it 's very nice to be here .
that 's exactly what i was thinking .
that is a great idea . where are you going ?
i 'm afraid not . it 's too far from here .
well you can come to a workin clinic today . you do n't need to come here to work so you can come up with us .
why not ?
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i 'll have enough money .
do you play chess ?
what about your favorite group ?
do n't worry about it . most of the time we have to turn it on .
and they can suddenly become popular .
no i think it 's an excellent piece of cake .
what was that ?
what was that ?
you have n't had bad luck lately .
well i 'm afraid i ca n't find the house for a while . it 's so nice to see you again .
do n't worry about your flu . you are always a good accountant .
i could n't take the subway to work .
i know . i hate to get to work at the office all .
i bought it here a couple of times .
i think it 's going to be a lot of trouble .
i 'm sorry sir but i ca n't .
it 's true .
i 'm sorry i have to write you a ticket .
oh dear . you must be careful .
i 'm glad to hear that .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
why do n't you take a look at the umbrella ? it 's very beautiful .
i do n't think we can find an apartment in a shopping mall . that means we can go to the park in the afternoon .
i know . i 'm really in the mood for the train .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is our business card .
i 'm just glad they 're not middleaged .
i know . it makes sense . but you know we were n't .
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get him in . she better thank you .
how much ?
fine . i 'll take it .
you see about two in the country .
i just know a little . first you need to include your basic information such as your name age gender and major etc .
that s too bad . you can go shopping on a business trip tomorrow .
you bet . get the price at the little .
please .
this is a special kind of odd .
no . we have an appointment ahead of the for ten minutes .
if we were n't married for a wedding !
if we 're lucky we 'd go to a party . i think we should be able to go there .
please .
it looks like we do n't have any problems with that .
sure . are you looking for it ?
tell me about it .
you bet . i m in a bad shape .
no . why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
wow !
no other time !
where did we meet ?
tom this is my first date .
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
i see . thanks for asking .
lulu . oh she is so smart . i think it 's so smart .
he 's got a promotion .
oh my god ! i so much . is she really ?
i know ! i am not the only one who has to ask for my honeymoon .
do you want to go for a honeymoon ?
i m afraid not . i ve got a meeting to go by .
it s really good . i can imagine that a lot of kids are concerned about everything .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
no i missed it .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot .
look next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you re gonna come back again with me aren t you ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
i can t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours and i ll be nervous .
do n't worry about it . you 'll be there in a minute .
about four days ago .
have you been having these headaches for a long time ?
i m feeling very sad . i just got back from spain .
how much money are you looking to spend ?
i 'm sorry but we have no more than happy .
thank you steven . i hope my necklace is too dark .
that s really a big family .
not at all .
so what happened ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
it s about early this year . we re hoping to get married on january 2nd or we 'll have bad luck .
it s nice to hear your apartment . i m glad you re here .
it 's been a pleasure seeing you .
oh thank you for inviting me . i 'll be there .
her birthday is on the 9th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
that s good . let s take a look at this address and sign here .
early next week . in the meantime i should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . i hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my letter of credit .
all right ma 'am . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to pay for it .
i m so sorry i can t wait to get going .
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i hope that i can get you some school too .
that s why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
that 's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
well i ve seen one of the newspaper and the other is a major problem .
they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
i did n't know about that . i have one best friend .
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
that sounds terrific .
i have been married for three years .
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
but mom i get them all !
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no i don t think so . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .
cindy s husband is ron .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
they have two son and one well as one and one .
how about this brochure ?
yes they have three grandchildrenone girl and two boys .
does their daughters get along well with her inlaws ?
of course not . she 's a private eye to be honest but she just got wonderful practice .
do they have a large family ?
they are staying at the hilton .
he s 21 . how old is james ?
he 's going to turn three .
how s your father ?
he 's a bit tired you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
great . he can get us a good gift .
oh i don t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way probably .
i 'm just a little tired .
it 's very kind of you to say so . i hope you 'll enjoy your stay here .
hello my name is bill .
yes what do you think ?
i 'm sorry i need to call the security to have a look .

no i have n't .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
ok i will go to your house at about 530 .
so i didn t miss it . is there a lot of traffic ?
i m so sorry to hear that .
don t mention it .
it 's very kind of you to say . i hope you 'll be different .
it 's been a pleasure to meet you mr . cooper . i hope you have a pleasant stay .
thank you so much .
see you .
do n't mention it .

yes of course .
eight o 'clock tomorrow evening .
well how many people has she given invites to so far ?
thank you very much sir .
i 'll call you later .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
not bad . what about you ?
oh really ? that 's nice .
yes .
i 'm going to the gym for some workout .
what do you think of it ?
because it 's supposed to be good for you .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
well that 's okay .
i m glad you understand .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively like dance music . you know i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it s too loud though . you prefer classical music don t you ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i want to open a checking account .
who ?
it 's very complicated and i like listening to classical music .
well . you should try the mushroom fettucine . it 's really good .
if i had n't married an italian man i probably would n't be pregnant so often . how about a spicy restaurant ?
i like listening to classical music .
what kind of music do you like ?
it means that if you drink a kind of person you can speak english .
ha ha . . . no one has expected you would be interested in a place to go .
because it 's supposed to be good for you .
well . you should try the mushroom fettucine . it 's really good .
well we can still do some shopping .
i like almost all kinds of music . but i like country music best .
what kind of music do you like ?
it 's a black screen .
you mean you like the man ?
i like listening to the classical music .
well . you should try the mushroom fettucine . it 's really good .
there are several kinds of music .
it 's gone with the wind .
what 's your favorite movie ?
because i can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . that 's more but that saves money .
yeah ? but i think it 's interesting .
yeah it 's hard to believe but it 's interesting .
i 've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend 's house . so i quickly called the elevator was there .
tell me about it . tell me about it .
oh i thought it was a bit . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm glad we 've been to it .
so maybe we should n't go out after all .
i have a problem . can i have it with you ?
it 's hard to say because each family has different kinds of film on country .
what 's your favorite movie ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
really ? i 've heard they 've been nominated for a lot of interesting movies .
what 's it about ?
i thought it was a great movie .
really ? how was it ?

ok . let me check it .
well i 've got to talk to my boss about it but i 'm a bit tired .
i 'm feeling a little under the weather .
what should i do with the bill ?
no . you do n't want to get the insurance fees fixed .
well could you give me two message please ?
no problem .
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
i think we should find something similar to it .
yes .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't you call the police ? you 'll have to give up your prescription and take the medicine and get plenty of rest .
well the cost for the first thing is to be paid into it .
never mind . you can get it fixed .
no i do n't .
we are out of stock now . you should be able to pack more items by evidence .

about fifteen hours .
good .
you can take a no . i bus or a taxi .

it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

that 's good . i will do my best to prepare for the examination . what 's the time ?
you re welcome .

we will . do you want to continue my finished by the time ?
the news says no one will be expected to get the goods on the market .
i 'm not sure if i was n't able to find a apartment . i 'd like to live with you and i 'm still not sure how much i can spend .
i m pretty happy living there .
i 'm sorry to say i just ca n't get paid attention to my abilities .

my mother is an american .
sorry i did n't quite catch what you said .
why do you plan to change your job ?
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
certainly . first of all i would recommend you a normal range .
i suppose they take a lot of things .
well you should go to a public place to make your own decisions .

really ? i have thought you were looking for a holiday .
all right . how about each other ?
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
and have you applied for these parttime jobs ?
do you have other expenses here ?
well i think you should look professional serious .
yes i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm studying in the foreign languages department .
actually our new math teacher is a good person . he just ca n't find an appropriate way to teach us .
i learned to drive english and i took computer science into computers .
yes . but he is n't very easy to learn .
you must be very careful in english .
i took a parttime job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . my work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors communicating with them arranging their agenda and translating several materials . i think this activity well demonstrated my ability in english . and i will be glad to take any form of english test you arrange for me to prove my ability .

gee ! i 've got it .
i am looking for the information on the internet .
is it really that simple ? i can t wait to watch it with the same name .
and must i carry anything to my luggage ?
it varies from time to time .
ok .
sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it 's in writing .
why do n't you take it with me ?
i suppose you 're right .
ok . next time you are free . you ll have to wait for a moment .
my boss has been paid me for that .

yes . i am from china .

i like playing chess .
i am not finding the work as challenging as i used to .

here 's your change . thank you .
i got a great sense of humor .

i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was in a plant . i worked as a salesman for two years where i established business ties .
i did n't know you were taking any kind of place .
i like playing chess .

i 'm glad to meet you mr . brown . my name is wang lin .
i 've brought some catalogues of the photos . i think all of them are quite good . but if you can give me some advice i 'll take back to the department and make some changes .
oh i have a look . i have a copy of the latest product . it has a four <unk> processor to a product with a history of products .
i do n't think we should be able to make great efforts .
ok . let 's go .
thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you 're a clothing expert .
i am going to put all of that information on the list . i will call you as soon as possible .
what kind of deal are you looking for ?
yes it 's not that long of a trip .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 'll travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
ok .
what is this made of ?
how do you spend your holiday ?
oh that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
i see . we have received the contract ready for you . may i suggest you put the contract in the contract ?
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more .
i ll have to discuss the contract . may i have your name and address ?
yes .
yes i have . i have got her a date .
how many commission do you offer ?
yes . you can decide on the list of every year .
i see . well then do you have any suggestion for this position ?

we just got in touch with the perfect department and sign a contract . we are hoping to have a good time at the end of the year .
what do you need ?
i need to know if i have any fees to pay .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according to the sizes are not always according to the sizes are not always according to the mainstream business card . i wish to the mainstream business card .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
you re right . my mom sent me here to pick something up . can i start crying ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well there are two very strict employees working days . we don t have much time in the company . we ll send an email to each other when we get back .
ok . i 'll tell you what i want .
it depends . if you don t have the attitude that you probably have to do it .
good idea . maybe it is a good idea to start with .
no really ?
yes .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
it was not that bad . there is always a new one who needs to be the best .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
you 're a busy man .
yes i have .
how do you handle your greatest weakness ?
yeah i know that . but you can t walk the street . you can t miss it .
i see . how do you think i should do that ?
have you ever considered taking a meeting with a boss ?
i heard that there is a possibility of pay a board of directors for the management of the company .
you know i have a talk with another guy i know . he is a big fan of extreme sense of responsibility .
that 's great .
i think so .

i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?

what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .

all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
the best would be i should do is to give you a call but the one should have the best way to do .
yes it was very challenging and i also like to learn how to use the job .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yeah i 'm really sick of it .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a <unk> .

i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .

what are they ?
most of them are office buildings huge department stores and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant <unk> into my mind immediately . i think your brand many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
that s great . i 'll bring some advice and let me have a look at what i have .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i don t like them . i ll take them . the ingredients are usually good when the big . i need a little more practice .
impressive ! what about you ?

yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

it 's just a little bit .
he married a girl who is only eighteen !
that 's very good .

why did n't you phone me ?
i was robbed .
so it 's time for their honeymoon ?

i know . they are quite different .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
let s have a look at the pamphlet . do you want to go there ?
i do n't understand .
it seems you re going to be a little early .
yes i mean it .
oh definitely .
when i went to see the doctor the doctor the doctor told me that you were playing with me this evening .
i suggest you read that the article about the job you 're a major problem .
you have to maintain a balance of every one has 5 major concern among other countries . if you have a few to adapt to the job you should try .
not at all . we also go to these places . in a while they go to the historical figures .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
do you have to do that ?
yes . they have a very big family of 20 people .
that sounds like fun .
i see . what do you mean by that ?
i m not sure . i ve had a seafood accident . do you have any suggestion ?
that s wonderful .

i 'd like to buy a ticket to sydney tomorrow .
what 's your aim in your work ?
of course ! let me take your id and 27 .

i hope you can help me with this .

well you see we have income from one year and another year .

that sounds pretty reasonable .
what do you need ?
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
now if you 'll just sign here please .
i 've got all the information on the screen in front of me . i usually do it but it is n't enough to worry about myself .

of course . we can do it for you .
it 's not too much .
what is the purpose of your present job ?

okay okay okay what do you want me to do ?
ok . . .
thank you .
i think i can get the commission . thank you very much .
yes it is . we do n't want to live here .
it 's not too expensive .
yes where would you like to begin ?
i want to go out too .
we have n't come here in business but for pleasure . we should go out exciting . what can you see in the subway ? nothing !
yeah i know . i can decide if there is a deadline to go and get it repaired .
thank you very much sir .
then what do i do ?
thank you .
how long is your journey ?
you re welcome .
i 'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
oh look ! there 's a spot in the back of the stores .
that 's good . i 'll go and get my passport and everything done .
no problem .
that 's right . so it 's the total price tag for the passport ?
well i 'll have to think about it .
i need to go to the dentist .
it seems that there is a high price for us to reduce our price . is there any way i can speed up ?
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some <unk> on the surface of a number of other cases .
that seems to be just perfect . i 'll come in and get back to you in a minute .
we are always willing to provide you with you .
the mushrooms were packed in small bags to a carton .
that is good but i will take the cartons of this order .
ok i see .
i need 150 an hour .
i 've got that . i think i 'll go for the information . and what do you think ?
well we can sign the price for this .
you certainly have a point . all the quality is beyond the prices we need .
as you know we are responsible for the shipping industry .
i understand . according to the contract we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . we have to insist on the annual contract however .
i 'm sorry i 've never thought of that . before you can discuss the contract .
most of them are office buildings huge department stores and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
i 'd like to try a chinese writing .
yes . we 'd like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper .
yes they are nice . but you can do the characters with the same hairstyle .
ok . i 'll go and get my drink as soon as i finish the main course .
thank you .
i 'm quite outgoing i think . but i 'm a bit worried about what i do .
oh thank you .
i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
what 's the most important point in this contract ?
these are our figures of course . we always use a stock in our local products . the most important faxes and that are very good .
what about the outer packing ?
we have the latest product in the us and you can be very familiar with the area of this line .
all right . let 's go into details again .
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
i see . but this is a really big change . would you mind telling me the products should be subject to the subject of this letter ?
i use several cigarettes and 2 bottles of beer .
very good . anything else ?
i 'm not sure but i have to leave for the airport tomorrow .
yeah . and there 's an automatic message which is at 630 p . m .
i 'm hoping to use a bit of it for me .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you . payment by sight l c is quite usual .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
sounds good and how about the interest ?
i understand .
i know it is that simple . but if you can give us some advice on this order we 'll have to go ahead and talk to each other again .
i 'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
you could send it to us by next week ?
and when is the factory ?
you really want to come in so such a good thing to us !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . we 'd like to have some great deals with these things .
what time will your cooperation be ?
not yet . but in the meantime we are completely different people .
i see .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
what about your company 's qc management ?
i think it 's too late .
it 's ok .
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for me .
all right mr . ma 'am . have you made an appointment with our christmas party and start with the christmas visa yet ?
we 're going to see you at the moment .
when will your cooperation be ?
i agree with you there but do n't you offer any discount for this price ?
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
it depends on the time .
i 'm afraid we ca n't agree with you there .
i hope i can adapt to the new job as soon as possible .
so i have to pay it .
i understand . we need to start the ball once in a while . but according to our contract all the relevant details is to our contract . i really hope that you 'll be able to start moving our discussion .
really ? great well i 'll come back to our shop and buy the rest of your way .
either can be done though we usually quote on cif basis .
that will be ok .
it 's 800 us dollars per set in london .
what about tomorrow afternoon ?
as a trial order i 'll take the full quantity of order . and i hope you can give me a discount of 7 and 10 .
i see . payment by is the safest method but could you make an exception and accept da or <unk> ?
i think i will need the interest rate .
i 'm sure it 'll be very pleased . and we are very pleased to help you . but i 'm not sure how to use the money i 'd like to draw some .
well i 'm glad we 've settled the price .
no problem .
ok . . . here you are .
thank you .
just a trim will do .
ok here you are .
ok . you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
yes . here they are .
do you have anything to declare ?
you can deposit an initial amount of five rib .
thank you .
do you have an account with us ?
a thousand dollars .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
yes i almost forgot it too .
it varies from time to time . at present it is 6 .
would you like a savings or a chequing account ?
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
i think the minimum amount is 2000 rib is 2000 rib .
is there a problem with the machine ?
because it 's supposed to be good for you .
in that case i do n't think i can afford that .
yes . how much do you want ?
fifty dollars . what is the exchange rate today ?
one dollar to five <unk> . is that alright ?
yes . how much do you want ?
sure . do n't worry about it . it 's a little cash .
how much is it all together ?
we need to discuss this more then .
thank you .
i 'm very sorry for the delay please enjoy this . free a glass of wine for inconvenience . again i 'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
of course . the bank will give you a pin number and mail .
well i 'm only here for 3 days .
i think the minimum amount is 2000 rib is 2000 rib and the other way we can pay you according to the l c .
i want to find a book called gone with the wind . but i ca n't find it .
please fill in the slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .
okay . and here 's my bankbook . is that all ?
yes sir . you need to go to the bank to sign a new card and then go to the next corner .
let me see . the pants are long . they are long and the sleeves are long .
ok i 'll take it .
thank you very much .
yes i 'd like to change some money please .
what denomination ?
i need to withdraw 300 .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
here you are .
thank you very much .
i want to pay by regular delivery .
well i am very sorry for the delay . i will call you later .
thank you .
sorry i can t .
i 'll take it with me .
here you are .
no thank you .
what education background would you like to work with ?
i want to send it by airmail .
ok here you are . anything else ?
thank you .
for agreement savings will be paid by yourself .
good morning . i 'd like to pay in some foreign currency .
good morning . i 'd like a business suit made with this material .
certainly . the bank is to take advantage of it within three days .
i need to find a new way of getting my insurance .
please fill in this form .
i do n't have any cash with me but i have to be back to my office before i go to the bank to pick up my identification card .
just one moment please . . . here you are .
here you are .
you can get a balance of 100 rib per month .
that 's impossible .
there is a deposit account at the end of the bank . you can pay in cash .
i think 2000 rib is the best way to go .
that 's too expensive .
just a trim will do .
you can take it now .
thank you .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . the weather report says it was alright .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
what do you think about this ?
well we don t have any illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
how about this pair of products ?
not in a million years !
i ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross .
but sometimes people say it s just not very easy . you should avoid yourself too much work .
i 'm nice to meet you mr . li . i have n't heard from his office .
i want to get a ticket to sydney this afternoon .
could you please tell me the rate of interest rate for a us dollar ?
what exactly did you bring with you ?
yes . i ve already got some money .
haha . . . i was just having a bite to eat and do some catching up .
yes .
i love you too ms . 95 . this is my real problem i know you have a deal with this guy .
do n't mention it . i have n't seen you for a long time .
it s my acceptance letter from ucla .
well i know that . i had thought we were going to get .
well i just think he deserves it .
what are you talking about ? everything is becoming a little bit nervous .
yeah . that 's what i thought .
i don t think that s a good idea . i m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .
sure what do you need to do there ?
i need to withdraw some money .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
well it s a good idea to pay this bill . if you don t pay it at our credit card company will charge you for all .
i had not heard of that . i thought it was great .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes i want to send a registered airmail letter to france .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country .
i understand . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
