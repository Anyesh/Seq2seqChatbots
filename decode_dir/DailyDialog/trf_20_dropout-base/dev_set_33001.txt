i prefer one in the same size .

you seem to make sure he gets the message .
but you 're right . so i can find it .
i really do n't think so .

maybe i should ask him to teach me the first time .
thank you .
yes . i 'd like to have a share of steak .
these are the ones with the line . here 's the form and the money you sent them to our room .
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've got a great variety of products . most of our customers have many different kinds of seafood .

yes we will have the same house .
i do n't know why they have the same feeling .
because i want to know what 's on that channel .

ok . thank you very much for your understanding .
i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ?
and you have to buy some clothes for the internet .
that s the best part .
this one is very light and it has a problem . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
no problem . how about this one ?
well i do n't like the design but i think they 're quite fashionable .
ok . your total is . .
thanks . how much is it ?
oh yes . excuse me . could you tell me how to get there ?
yes madam . the pharmacy will give you a discount as much as possible .
it 's right here . the regular store is located on the third floor .

i 'm going to need to cut the pound .
i 'd like to have a bowl of dumplings .
we have a few hundred and twenty .

yes please .
can i get you some coffee ?
yes i do .
i ll have to use the machine in there right now .
yes we do .
is this your first trip to the united states ?
no problem .
sure .
well .
when will the lecture begin ?
okay . why do n't you have a drink ?
i d like to have the beer please .
i do n't know . i do n't like romance . so i 'd suggest you have a try .
could i reserve a table for saturday at p . m . ?
good evening . my wife and i would like a room please .
all right . make sure you a double will be fine .
no thank you . please get us some .

well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
oh i see . here is the money .
thank you very much .
well i 'll take up with that .
so how did i know that ?
i do n't know . but you want to bring a knife a fork a map .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
i see . so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
you can bet of that . they can eat some chocolate .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
sorry . i thought you knew .
no problem . what do you want me to do ?
ok . i 'll wait for you .
hi mary .
o . k . may i see your name ?
here is your key . the bellhop will take care of your room . have a nice evening !
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
all right . could i have a look at it please ?
i think you re not going to get a new apartment as well .
why do you think i can get a new carpet and i 'll be back for a year ?

yes . we have a room on the right .

i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
sure . what do you think of this dress ?
and the sea ?
we would like to have a look at the menu .
what do you think of the leading kid ?
well . we have only kinds of postal saving services like this . it 's a bit smaller .
sorry . i thought you knew .
no problem . what do you want me to do ?
yes some places are very different from that the nearest branch .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .

ok i will take some .
other than how you can find other perfume and write video segments and create these quickly .
i want to find a book called gone with the wind .
yes . what size are you ?
they look just too casual .
i do n't think i 'll take any of those on looks do you have any other colors ?

that 's really a good idea .
that 's easy . can you give me a try ?
i thought she would marry me to have office .
i guess i should have gotten it .
he had a sudden sense of accomplishment when he was elected .
ok i will .
yes .

i know but my boss is always jam full of time .
no . i 'm always in trouble .
i promise i wo n't be back until later .

i think about ten minutes by bus .
how long will it take to get there ?

yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have to try to think about this . i just want to get it to you on .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?

he told me that if i showed up late one more time he 'd better speak to mr . lin .

ok i will .
yeah . that 's a good idea . let 's get the tickets for the train .
i know what you mean .
there are two stops .
could you please tell me what the journey is ?
i suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station .
oh sorry . i m not sure .
i think so . it 's even a little tight .
ok . is the bus station open from here ?
are you sure it 's in a different frame ?
yes . i d like to do that .
no problem .
sure .
i 've got a suit a woolen sweater and some white wine .

i 'm here on vacation .
i 'm sorry sir . the taxi was full .
i have a housing contract with the university .

of course . you know the account number and there are many customers . but you must get some l c 'mon . you just want to know how to get around .
how long do we have to stay there ?
i think the best way to move out is because it 's actually a noisy idea .
it will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection .
i 'm sorry we have quite a bit of a problem . could you give me some discount on it ?
can you check this magazine out please ?
it seems a bit too complicated .
i am sorry about the quality . we usually don t have any questions about it .
what s up ?
look . i want to put this game with you .
it s awful . do you have to go shopping ?
just one minute please . that 's easy .
are you sure you want to buy anything ?
i can t smoke !
maybe you can give us some advice . they will give you a shot .
i was robbed .
that 's cool . i was so nervous when the water was this morning .

i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i really like that dress but it 's not very practical . i really like it .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might be dollars .
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars a dozen .

i guess i 'll just buy the dress and make the decision .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they might have been on an internet too .
that 's a good idea .
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
you 're right .
it 's just a couple of minutes . do n't worry . there 'll be no charge for you .
here you go .
sure . what about going to the mall ?
well . . . i do n't know . . did you go there ?
oh no i wo n't . i 'm sorry .
you see i told you . you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault .
my bad . it was very kind of you to say so . but my friend was in a hospital . she would have been my fault for the moment and i just ran away .
good idea .
what kind of food do you want ?
we could go to a more places this time if you liked .
yes but i still miss the last bus .
ok now mr . smith . i 'll be right back .
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .

we ca n't live in a room if you want .
my good history is not only a few years ago .

well i do n't know . i think the computer is the result of the computer .
i 've got to make sure and most of our customers are in a different way .
no . you ca n't watch the tv .
right over here .
oh do n't you think so ? is n't it far ?
i think i 'm having a sore throat . let me have a look .
you can buy them from the rental agency .
oh you are fine . you can cut them off with a little faster .
you 'll like it .
here you are .
what 's special about it ?
it 's about years old .
how about this scarf the walls ?
i was thinking of taking a walk when my friend at the mall would n't like it .
ok . . .
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i was hoping that i was hoping that by taking a walk . the cord gives me a ride home .
doctor . i feel dizzy . i 'm weak .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'll have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
the price today is each .
well i 'll take it .
they 're like steamed an electronic playground .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do they come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
did you find anything you are interested in ?
you 're welcome .
is there anything you 'd like ?
ok so i 'll see you then .
how long will it take to get this weekend ?
no .
the last four days .
i see . there are still two things you need to get to school .
i hope so .
that 's what i need .
is there anything you would like to have ?
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
your price is rather high .
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
what produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago . i think it was four months ago .
that 's since last time i went to the store to get my passport from the doctor for a while .
why do you use a different car ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
ok well when i put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
well you know we want to try it on .
well it 's a fruit with a big seed .
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?

well it 's been looking at something i can just bring home and we can get together with our new wife .
they 're a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed .
oh that 's unbelievable . i 'll take them .
that 's what i thought .
yeah . it 's definitely a waste of money .

most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .

looks good . how much does it cost ?
that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags power steering and power windows tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle to use .
that s really convenient . the air is so fuel to the further .
it s mainly the same as in the back of the street .
now what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
no the test for our regular customers . and we can take care of this lot of first now .
but these things are the same thing .

all right . let s do it .
i know .
would you like another beer ?
well i 'm always in thinking of cooking . there is n't enough rolls in the wash . we have n't had enough rolls yet .
well i see .
no . first of all you need to do is to get out of the car . let 's go to the butcher 's shop and buy a drink . then you can enjoy the paintings and play .
any place will be better .
oh yes . it s just a few minutes walk . turn left at the traffic light and you ll see it .
can you drop me off this afternoon ?
main street .
ok . i 'll do it .
there s too much traffic jam .
i do n't think you 're right .
yes . there are n't enough buses in this city .
you are now ? what happened ?
hmm . . . it sounds like something about the town . can you sing ?
ok i ll get you something to drink . i m sure you ll have got everything .
do you think we should go to the new concert ?
oh i forgot about it .

yeah . get the receipts out .
i m not sure . i must be going around your neighborhood . i think i must be right around .
yeah . he used to be there too .
sure . let s go .
exactly .
i think you re right .
oh really ? how come ?
do you know where you 're going to find a place that is ?
i like to be a part of the city .
i know . it s very nice of you to live here .
oh i see . did you come to the local school yet ?
you d better get an apartment since you are interested in the utilities .
is there anything good at the moment ?
yes it is . can i get it on the phone ?
i get a copy of the manager . why don t you get a hold of them for a moment ?
where to ?
please type it to the railway station .
would you like to sit near the window ?
i have a meeting in a few minutes .
ok see you then !
well that 's true . i have an extra ten in total .
i 'd like to .
i 'm lucky that you did n't get my hair done .
i 'm going to need at least a month .
oh i see .
thank you .
yes i do .
where are you going ?
two blocks away please .
certainly . do you want to remit it by o m . or by the way ?
ok . i promise .
you will need to pay the deposit into the account .
ok . here is your change . thank you .
it 's a private garden .
you are a real pal . will you be home ?
thanks .
that 's right . what can i do for you ?
thank you .
hi . this is maria . is that shirley ?
sorry . this is not what i m asking for .
it seems that it is a little overweight for people from the hard time to find .
yes i am .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that would be great ! thanks .
see you then .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery .
that sounds fantastic ! i like to try something in the downtown area .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it 's perfect for people busy with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
we have a range of congratulations ! i can help you with that . we have a range of beautiful customer services . i think you can find your new apartment with a very nice local have a similar location of you .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . . . well sir . you can phone me again if you have n't been in town . . .
ok .
yes . i ll have a room free next week .
what do you think of it ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be alright to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time do you expect him back ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok . goodbye .
where do you want to find your living room ?
no problem . first it has a lovely view . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric appliances that the transportation is much larger . the only thing you can figure out what it 's suitable for or to read . finally it 's important . finally it 's important to the electricity is convenient .
there is something in the city too but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
that 's all right .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
i agree that is not the one who wants to hear about it . if no one will be reasonable .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s near the university ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
he was in the bedroom and a few miles away .
me too . and now i am so so successful .
great ! we are talking about our son's attendance and his study for classes . we are sure to have a good time .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi mary !
hi jim . how is everything ?
i went to the last minute . you should go to the bar you wanted .
i 'm glad to be along with you .
i am having dinner with my family . do you want to come ?
congratulations ! that 's great .
i really do n't know how i can thank you .
that 's ok . this is my first interview . if you have any questions please let me know .
of course . i 'm looking forward to meeting with you .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i 'll be fine .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss .
what is your strongest trait ?
actually it 's just a couple of dollars . and also the total is dollars .
that 's not a problem . i do n't know how he could do that .
ok .
thank you . see you then .
ok . see you .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
we do n't have anything to worry about . we do have the best <unk> in the country . what do you think about it ?
i m going to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of twenty percent off by measuring unit .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick me up at the square . ok .
yeah . where is the men's room ?
when i don t want to do it !
are you sure ? i thought you were going to give me a chance .
which side is it ?
i ve heard about it ! how old are you ?
i m sorry ! i just ca n't get out of work !
is it the counter that you have no other computer ?
you re right .
yes i m looking for a sweater .
how many models do you want ?
i m not sure . i d like a laptop . can i see a picture of your laptop ?
is there anything else ?
i see . i will ask my wife to give her a chocolate chip as a gift for her .
sure .
i think we 'd better take a bus to get downtown .
so you must be pretty interested in that .
yeah it 's got a extra night off from now on .
i d like to buy an inexpensive camera .
oh no . that 's too kind . i 'll try it .
i agree but i d suggest you buy credit for missing the internet .
what 's it look like ?
yes . this is the latest product .
the internet could use a lot worse .
oh ! can i get a second order for you ?
oh i am sorry . i do n't feel like going out .
this is paula . how can i help you ?
i 'd like a half a pound of ground beef please .
what kind of ground beef do you want ?
could i also have a few pounds of <unk> breasts ?
no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no . that 's all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
good . i d like to try some things .
okay .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i want to buy some flowers and newspapers .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem a couple of sunflowers a single day and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a bear . what else do you think ?
oh this is the latest design . i ve met this is sure to make sure the first thing . the pictures are very well made of metal . i m sure this camera will make the same difference .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get me a replace my car !
i m sorry . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . the stress will not be needing anything for today .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok how much is a better idea ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if you are going to be easy .
if it does n't work it could be so complicated ! if you give me the receipt and i ll give you your money back !
i know . i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the colors .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what you are washing clothes . for example for example you are washing up and prices . for example you have to go through a few clothes that are washing machine .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
this is a really big cut . ok then we 'll just use the stairs and the green line is a bit green .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
well i suppose i had the same thing three days . the trainer said it was too crowded . and i have to write it all over .
i 've had that problem too many times . i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
how much money should i give you ?
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i will try . where are you going ?
i think i 'll go to the river .
ok . here you go .
no . but it still needs to have a strong feeling . you know you have to read a book .
really ? that 's very important . you can go to the class for me . just write down your name and phone number .
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
it 's not as fun as john . he 's a french teacher .
damn ! i just lost track of all my money .
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with the funeral !
no problem . i want to get a premium premium premium paid for the premium . this connection might be a bit slow . how about this ?
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
you ll have to pay in cash or credit card .
awesome !
yes i would like to do that .
i m most upset about it . i don t understand why the government could do that .
look at it . you can see the dark angel !
i am so happy that you found what it looks like . is it a new place ?
sounds good . what about your come by your good news ?
it is the most expensive sir .
sure . why don t you try it on ?
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i think it s june now .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there . let me see . . . it 's a good color . i think i m going to buy this scarf . i need a new pair .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too .
of course . i m not sure . the fitting room is right over there .
thanks ! i won t let it go !
it 's not really all that good .
i think so . i 'll just buy a one .
but there 's no hot water after at night .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
and the kitchen and the bathroom .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small .
maybe we could get some new furniture . i think it would be better to get a few clothes .
i have to get a better idea but that we can get a new furniture in this afternoon .
you are absolutely right .
how long have you been here ?
the utilities says it s only .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
how much money can you buy ?
why don t you go to work then ?
you can get a credit card or simply pressing the shutter .
that will be fine .
how about going to a theatre ?
i just want to give you a ride home .
that s the best i can do .
yes i do . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . the meal is tasty and the wrapping paper .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up .
as long as i know you are trying to find something that you like .
i ve always been learning chinese dishes . they are very tasty .
it s probably the same nowadays . i ve heard that you earlier . it s important to get a new book .
not really . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are very important . the way is is is the way that the food is prepared .
no way ! i 'm sure it will be a great cook . so i 'd like to get used to chinese people from their supermarket .
from a sweet part i would like to make a few different from what i 'm cooking .
certainly . come with me please .
please have a look . thanks .
that 's blue . i 'll just have the blue suit .
it 's more expensive than paying .
i don t think you could find out if anyone want to .
hey that s too bad . let s get a little exercise .
i like the design . you can get them back to your country . the fitting room is this afternoon .
i think pink will be fine .
would you like to have them delivered to your party ?
i need a jacket and tie .
wow your wife must be very happy .
thanks .
i am sorry . he is busy now . can i take a message ?
i was wondering if i could ask you to a few questions about the job .
yes it 's still vacant . are there any other things it 's going to be okay ?
i think it would be better for a view . the view is the two or a small apartment .
i think it 's convenient . the apartment is on sale for two people to take care of the utilities .
fine . see you then .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
no . thanks . i 'll find it soon .
you go see the library ?
thank you . here is my card .
no . everything is free .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes it 's still too late . the price price is little higher .
i also think the price is too high . do you have any cheaper ones ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes that 's right .
could you give me a hand ?
why not ?
i think i could stand outside and see what you 're going to do .
that 's great . i think i 'll take it .
it looks great . i love the kitchen . and the garden in the living room and the kitchen are cool .
i think it 's a bad idea .
i think that the best way to make a decision . the room is ready by friday .
oh just one .
it 's great ! what 's it about ?
how about the stove ?
and my floor needs to be in a different environment .
i don t know . but i don t think i ll hurt it .
it 's a nice sweater and it 's black .
ok i love the lawn . i also bought a great front of the beautiful lawn .
the dark angel ! i love the dark clouds .
i am afraid there is no room for you .
it s not very elegant .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hi mr . smith what can i do for you ?
is it furnished ?
i love to be happy to help you .
here you go .
yes . i 'm expecting to come by p . m .
i hope that you get all the things done in before then . make sure you make it easier .
i 'll see you there at .
why do you think you 're interested in a quiet school ?
thank you . i 'm looking forward to your arrival .
no . but you must bring everything to you .
yes i 'm looking for a porter do you have ?
well you know we have a new computer here . but you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i do n't have much in a computer . and i think i could get a computer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i can download a computer from our computer and it 's just like a system .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about it . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it only goes
ok .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple .
i see . but i 'm afraid i ca n't find the guarantee of a large computer .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
i have n't heard anything about it .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do .
i see . what are they ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
i see . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision .
no do n't be sorry . but you ask him to tell him i 'm sure you can understand .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're welcome .
how about this one ?
yes he knows i am coming by mr . thomas . he just told me about it .
that 's fine . what can i do for you ?
i want a haircut .
do you know how short you are ?
it 's a little too tight . but make up your mind .
i see . please take a seat . i 'll take the pink one for you .
i 'm not sure whether i can wear it . i like to get a hair cut .
the same here is .
yes please do .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
of course .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that s a really good idea .
do you think you can be more miserable than before ?
it 's just a short hair .
let 's just say there was a breakin .
yes if it will help .
yes .
well . how about this one ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll try it .
i love the picnic too .
i think you 'd be a very nice apartment for just two people .
is it convenient for you to do the housework ?
let me check . we will check it out .
i really like it so i think we could have to think of it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is it really worth paying for ?
yes it might be . we just do n't have a problem with it .
well since my husband and i make a plan to pay a month for rent .
let me check . we can leave it to you .
i think you will get to choose the best house for the kids to get so when you get all the pick up . when you get back home you had the carpet cleaned and use it 's a great way to get a new carpet .
we can check out the house and choose what we like .
it 's really a good idea . but you can see it . it 's the only way to get rid of the clothes .
yes we will have the same house .
i do n't know why they have the same feeling .
because i want to know what 's on that channel .
when will it be ?
no it 's easy . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of money .
actually i think a coffee shop may be better .
i just ca n't .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about pizza or maybe a hot cake ?
i 'd like to have chinese food .
yes . i heard chinese is it easy to learn . but i heard it is very different .
i am .
what do you mean ?
i like cooking very much .
certainly . let 's see some pictures of our delicious dishes are over there .
no i have n't . i do n't know how to practice .
and if you eat something you must n't eat too many vegetables too far away .
thank you .
yeah i know they 're probably available of cooking . while i always get a food course and there 's a culture of my favorite cooking .
no i do n't want it .
you are right . let s see you have some specialties .
i know but they have already sent back to the small ones .
i 've just got a new account . i need to get some money and my expenses expenses . can you save them ?
i know . i know that they know the advertisement for them . but they know they should have their contact information .
i know . they know they already have the whole range but they can really appreciate .
yes .
alright so i do n't have any work . do i have to prepare for the computer ?
you 're welcome .
it 's a great idea . the price is great .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
i 'd like to say it 's a little more .
well we have done some things this year .
oh i like to .
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
i recently found some of my pants are beautiful .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i agree . sometimes the sunshine and sunshine are beautiful .
yes i do . i have a friend who works in a shop . i can do that .
there 's a lot of options .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know . i was thinking that a little more expensive than a born .
that 's right . when was the date ?
i am here to speak with you about your group . do you have anything to declare ?
the cafeteria is yuan .
will you ever buy me a lot of work ?
of course . you can contact them in when you leave the supermarket .
yes i 'm looking for a green dress .
do you have any black skirt that will go with this one ?
yes here you go .
good . our products are usually about two weeks . i do n't think you can find anything nice .
i 'm off of them .
yeah . you 'll go and get them to the store .
oh i do n't think i 'll take any of those on . do you have any other colors ?
maybe you should ask her to go with you .
well what about friday ?
that s great . you re not interested in the job .
well i guess i will simply have to pay my credit card .
i 'm sure that i do n't have any of those things . do you have a black skirt ?
okay .
i 'm afraid i 'll be a <unk> . my family would be responsible for me .
here you are .
thanks . now if you could please verify the room rate here initial next to the x and sign here . how many keys will you need ?
no thanks . i 'm a lot of cash .
oh i 'm so glad to do that .
sure . what do you want to know ?
can you run over to my store ? i need your help .
do you have any other choices ?
would you please wait a few minutes ?
do you have any other choices ?
have you taken a walk ?
it 's the same way to you .
yeah you are right . i 'll also get some food and some fried noodles .
whatever ! you say ! what about it ? how about you ?
cool ! what are you going to get ?
how about some chicken ground beef and some kebabs ?
thank you . i have made progress .
oh i see . well what about your brother ?
yes . i finished them just this morning .
yes i do . i 'll have a lot of practice .
that s really interesting ! i thought you were playing the piano !
i usually get a lot of things from my mother whenever i am cooking .
right ! you ve got to cut down on your sugar and intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . you know what you drink are in perfect condition .
hey for me . but you know i like street best . i can always get a new life done !
that s a great idea . you ll probably have a great breakfast .
well i always get up with some dishes . the only thing i do is listen to is listen . you know you should do some cook a lot of papers .
alright now we have a twoforone happy hour special . do you have any other drinks ?
yes we do . the first part is the second part of china .
yeah that 's a great idea . i have a few friends that will be a picnic .
it 's a great place to eat .
yes you like it . i ve always been learning chinese dishes so i can always make dishes from those countries . and you like the way you know anyone who you like .
i always order fried rice and egg soup .
our customers are all handmade .
that 's fine . can you give me some more coffee ?
it 's the same as ever as we are a clear friend . maybe it will be a good thing .
i just want to stay in the morning .
well i see . i ll have a glass of beer .
thank you i think i could use some help . i know i could use some changes right away .
not at all . you can take care of yourself .
no way . i 'd like to order a large coke .
i 'd like to get you to a diet .
maybe i 'll try it .
no they are too boring . some of my friends are already <unk> . and i have a problem finding a parttime place .
fine ! i 'll start drinking with that . is n't everything else ?
that sounds great .
no i have n't . what about you ?
i don t want to make a decision . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy .
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap . they are n't tasty .
let 's have a try .
yeah why not . do n't you have all the ingredients ?
i know . i bought all these ingredients last time . it was really interesting .
why do we take a walk ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once a week before the playoffs they turn out some oil and put a few drops in each box .
what about the chicken ?
i bake chicken because it 's a healthy way to eat it .

i see . thank you very much for your help .

you re welcome .
jack .

of course ! you can have a <unk> to show that is to our clients line . no doubt we have a <unk> who can really cut on our own .
are you kidding ? you got a bad job .
i think so . he can be very easy .
you think it 's better that he should be told ?
well i was just wondering . do n't you have anything ?
oh that 's too bad . do n't be so pathetic .
i got a computer engineer 's english certificate and a computer .
what class did you come in ?
you 're right .
you 're right sir . i 'm sure you can do better than anyone .
no . i was n't able to get a license . they were all right .
that 's pretty much .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
how come ?
do n't worry . you do n't want to study well .
i do n't want to earn my money today .
my parents just didn t handle my older job .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
alright . did you go on a date already ?
it was n't as good as my kind of speaking . it 's .
it 's a pleasure .

did you check the periodicals ?
no i haven t .
i ll just have to check for you .
do you have anything to declare ?
you 're welcome .
thank you .
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though . they don t have smooth sides though .
no they are definitely the most powerful piece . it s definitely the total mystery based on the bottom of my extra key who arrived .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the bottom . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s the world s largest nonsense weigh .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it is mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that a perfect cube ?
it is a perfect cube . look at the building . the air is a square metres tall . it is a perfect cube . and there is a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders .
it s a book by ray and i need to get a new atlas . i m so sorry .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
actually many cities as the coasts a lot of their children are concerned about the education magazine .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small but compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france has almost right to many cities in europe but compared to many countries . france has doubled over the last few .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is great .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i want to find a book called gone with the wind .

i 'll see what i have .
yes i want to do that .
what classes do you have in mind ?
i 'm afraid you 'll change it .
never mind .
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this afternoon is all right with you .

well it seems that you got to take what you were going to do .
i think i want to take it .
i got the phone . what seems to be the problem ?
ok let me have a look .
i 'll be back as soon as i get home .
i have passed the five courses required by the end of the week .

i don t think it 's enough for us to get a more active job .
very good . can you come to our office at four o 'clock ?
no i would rather stay at home .
i can only hold a few minutes .
thank you .
did you have a look at them ?
let me take a look at the terms of time to discuss the details with you .
oh look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see that it 's the most delicious water to have .
i also like this . can i get that dry too ?
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
my english is n't an easy job . i think it 's a bit too many dollars .
are you kidding ? that 's a lot of money in the long jump up .

you know how hard it is to make a qualified decision .
uh . . . . i 'm not sure . . .
i will need to know what the hours are for .
why do n't you just go home and eat ?
that 's a bit ridiculous . i find it difficult to learn .
are you having any luck ?
to be honest i think it 's too easy to do .
do you think you can make any difference of other things you borrowed ?
ok . but do n't forget to say it .
but why ?
i need to make a deposit today .
may i have your library card ?
yes i have it . here you go .
what about cash ?
yes i d like to .
what are your plans for the evening ?
do you have the card with you ?
here you go .
oh yes . here you go .
that s really a shame .
i need you to send this letter to a few other countries .
i 'm sorry .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do n't think you were in love .
that s okay .
i 'm tired of all the time .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
exactly . he usually has his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
how old is he ?
you can say that again .
but i like its color .
well it 's getting expensive .
i 'll take you up with me .
i feel as a matter of fact .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
it 's not that bad .
say how about a dress ?
it 's my dream .
my pleasure !
i think it 's a good film for a film .
but he s better than the others .
do n't be so sad .
i know . you don t love me ! you should never do such a good game .
that s great . can you bring some fruit ?
yes . and in the morning .
how have you been ?
you seem to have a very good reason for your secretary . i thought you were getting a little bit out of it .
so have you been taking a new train for a while ?
well the presents for my family is working here so i hope to get better .
that 's a very good husband . sometimes a poor man and a girl like that .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
well my sister will be in her own way .
that 's all right . anything else ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i honestly do n't know how i could explain it to you .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? that 's great !
what 's wrong with it ?
sounds interesting . but really .
the man behind his back is back .
you got it . thank you .
sure what 's up ?
oh really ? how do you know that ?
i said it is a lovely day .
no . i do n't think you 'll ever stay in the haunted house .
i bought it in this store . can you see it ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
do n't worry . what about it ?
do you have some shoes ?
definitely . it 's hot .
i see . very well done .
that 's a lot of money .
what is it ?
can you introduce him to me ?
i feel like having a dog .
you are too shy !
i like the song . what do you do ?
where are you going ?
i 've been studying for a long time .
oh come on . i really love you .
she 's the one who saved the life of the man last year .
what 's her name ?
i was in a meeting with her .
exactly . do you know what the teacher says ?
she 's very intelligent .
i do n't think she 's that you would be so happy .
i feel sorry for her .
why ?
yes . she was a teacher and a very good wife .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
of course . he still does .
sorry to hear that .
maybe it is n't my fault .
maybe he is n't my doctor .
what 's wrong with it ? it 's nothing like that .
but i think he must be careful .
i do n't know . but you know i 've never seen a strange one . i 'm always trying to call the phone .
did you happen to be in the ocean ?
oh i 'm sorry .
well i 'm looking forward to it .
i was just thinking about it . and you know i 'm in a hurry . so i 'm pretty sure i 'll have my best to try .
yes but the meeting was very busy this morning .
for instance the purpose of your store is limited in public .
yes someone has .
have you ever considered that one for the best ?
me too . do you have any change for him ?
i remember . i have seen him as a matter of fact .
let 's ask him to come by and give him a hand .
maybe . but i do n't know how to control the situation .
i do n't know . i just do n't know what the tests are .
when did he find out ?
is that ?
oh yeah . i remember .
really ? so you 'd better get back to me ?
sue i 'm her .
the meeting room does n't look like it .
my mother was bothering me .
have you been there before ?
really ? then you must be joking . do you think she was all that together ?
you want to go home ?
yes i did . the problem was that i bought was a lot of changes .
cool ! is he all right ?
thanks for letting me know .
thanks ! that 's a lot ! where 's the money ?
but i am not in the mood for it .
please wake me up .
of course . let 's make a deal .
no . the other day i have a lot of practice . i 'm single .
oh i 'm sorry .
what 's that ?
should we buy something ?
please just fill out this form and let me have a look .
yes we are very sorry for the trouble you .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
oh really ? how could i be ?
they 're not too expensive . i 'll take this one .
i 'd better stay home .
do n't forget to say that .
thanks a lot . oh well i want to meet you at the airport . can you tell me what it is today ?
that 's right .
you always have a good time .
yes i do . it 's really nice and cheap .
thanks !
what was that you just said ? last one . . . hey wait a second . .
you re right . i m at the moment .
i could use some <unk> . i could use it .
sure . here you are .
it says smoking is not only a position but there is a lot of gossip about us .
that 's great . do n't forget to have a park with us .
yeah . it 's much more than i had a week ago .
that 's nice . can you read the characters ?
i do n't like it . i 'm always out of shape . sometimes i get myself out of the city .
thanks .
i know . i could n't wait to get a chance .
yes i 'd rather not . thank you .
do n't mention it .
yes but you should n't give it too hot .
morning .
good morning .
i think i 'm really interested in your life .
well i want to ask you some questions about your educational background and experience .
do you have a credit card ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
you got a promotion !
it s true .
come on ! don t be silly !
no . . . . that s what i want .
well . you know i have to change my working environment . i don t have any opportunities to improve my work . i think my current job is because i am interested in a job in a new position in a much larger position . but i have the job .
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
i know he would never do such a thing .
i am sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
i think you 'll find the weather forecast for tomorrow .
do n't stay up late .
that 's all right .
ok .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i want to know what 's on that channel .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't have any hobbies . you always say this .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
and about time too .
it was me . i am so happy .
you should do better later .
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ?
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
that 's all right .
i do n't want to .
well come on . it 's really nice .
certainly not .
ok i 'll give you a call later .
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what 's the time ?
i just had to go home and watched tv .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what else did you say ?
i 'll be glad to . what do you want to get ?
i want to have a trip to sydney tomorrow .
it 's very kind of you .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
did you go to sleep or something ?
i have a little idea .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what steak do you like ?
well it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
well this is the specialty of the store . i know we 're both on the cut .
it was quite easy . i 'm studying .
you are welcome .
that 's great . thank you .
okay .
sure . i 'll have apple pie too .
actually you have n't had much .
i ll have a cup of tea .
perhaps it s nice .
yes i do .
thank you .
not at all .
you have to buy a lot of other brands such as flowers and make sure you sign the back of the pocket .
it 's too large . but i think you 'd better pack it up .
yeah i always knew that sometimes the people in the house but the street always rain .
yes . may i help you ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is wrong with it ?
well it does n't seem to be the only time in a couple of days but there is something wrong with it .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry . i 'm sure everything will be smooth .
oh no you are so kind .
thank you .
do you still remember to get a taxi ?
that s too bad . can you come here a little earlier ?
do you think you can finish everything ?
could you introduce me to the neighborhood ?
why don t you ask me for everything .
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this is what i mean . the first time i m here to start . what do you think ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm . . . this doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well you can have it on your way home .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m sorry . we ll take it . by the way what about the delay ?
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing .
i was just looking at home .
that s great . do you have any particular conditions that you would like to take into consideration ?
yes . by the way what 's the date today ?
we want to go to the large hall . i want to discuss with you the other suppliers .
she does n't touch with your hands . can you imagine how old it is ?
you think it 's a good idea to get a chinese restaurant .
yeah .
but i still get stuck on it .
hang on there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thanks . how long do you think i can find the way to get there ?
that s a good idea .
thanks for the trip .
i agree . we are really in a hurry .
i surely do .
you do n't have to ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve got to create my own business ! i m going to write up a business plan and that s really a lot of fun !
have you ever thought about getting a balance of some investors ?
no i have n't . can you say that again please ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how you will actually
geez . is that all ?
no . . ok here is the form and the money . . .
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um . . . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . . . can you make sure i make a little sideburns and just take a little off the side for a little while .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out .
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
it 's very nice .
and this one ? too flashy ?
i think this is the coolest watch .
watch this before you hear it . hey watch your watch .
i guess .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you help me ? i ve always been making a few plans .
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! do you know who your favorite is ?
no way ! go and play it .
the same to you !
cut out what i m doing .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup of coffee !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and forget and forget to forgive you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we should get something to drink . that way we can cover ourselves .
that s enough . let s get a good idea and you ll play it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i am sorry . i have to get you another day .
of course ! well let 's do it . we have a chance to get a ticket and put the sugar in before .
well i think the most important thing is the way to make up the job .
be patient . something terrible is wrong with the food .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on ! i have no idea what you say . i m not in the mood for a change .
do you think you are going to get around ?
really ?
yes . and they did n't get my order right either .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it about ? why do all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me a try .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
i m just sad . the situation just came in from the couple of days . how s the problem ?
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
i see . you can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
again ? you just went last week ! you have to go away to the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first i like to look into some nails <unk> . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my nails and apply my nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
is the last straw that i get up ?
i need to keep a better record of my correspondence writing .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
thank you very much .
i understand . i used to live in a quiet neighborhood with two people . we can sit together and enjoy a quiet time .
that sounds so cool . i wish you could stay in a bit of a time .
what 's up ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no i have n't . i 'm a bit of a romance .
i hope it will be a nice opportunity for you to see a star on the opening day .
thanks a lot . i worked for the same one .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
thanks for coming .

i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .

i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not used to that . and i do n't want to be like a noisy time .
i know . it 's as the nose .
you 're so lucky .
well you can bet this relationship 's going to be a flash in the pan .
oh it must be his girlfriend . i believe he will .
really ? what 's the problem ?
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
how do you like your salary ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
here you go . your rock is very old . can you sing a music player ?

take it easy . if you do n't mind going to the further tests that you are very smart .
it s a lot of money .

surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
oh yeah . i tried to read a lot of english .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make ?
first i worked as a servant .

ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
it 's interesting . i ca n't wait to see the guys here . the music is so delicious . i 'm on the internet .
that 's very nice . it 's a little boring . the music must be very modern .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i love music very much . it 's a favorite .
that 's really interesting . can you read any books ?
yes i do n't know . it 's a very simple procedure . do you have any suggestions ?
i think it 's too early for a show . i think the picture of the young people may lose weight .
it 's just around the corner .
oh i see so what the salaries are the same as the bus ?
it means that the quality is law and the handle .
very funny . it 's a very romantic meeting .
really ? i want to go too .
they 're almost very nice . i think we have many kinds .
the seats are coming down . he kept on a bit of a seats .

the russian man needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the pass .

yes of course .
yes i did . it was quite a horrible movie .
i understand . anyway we don t think you can do a little more .

i began to went there last month .
i 'll be fine .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss .

that 's not a problem . i do n't know how he could do that .
ok .
thank you . see you then .
ok . see you .

i like to always get a early start and sometimes the news on the internet .
yes i m playing with them . i ve always been making records of these posters .
that sounds great . okay now that you know that it 's been stolen by the end of the week .
i love to play with a musical .
it 's a good way to solve the problem .
can you give me a break ?
we broke up with it .
i did n't know that .
yeah . she was my first baby at a high school but she never did .
yeah . i heard he has been in a meeting with him at the moment .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
he told me that his friend has been in hospital for a few months and now i 'm going to have to have to have to go to the university .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
do n't worry . you know only been hit by your sister .
this is a grandfather . he was a farmer . he was calling the accountant with a boss . he was chatting with the boss .
really ? it is expensive for me to live here .
what do you think of it ?
i do n't know . can you make a phone call ?
well he was definitely very good and he kept taking credit for help .
did he say you were in hospital ?
i feel the same way .
did you ?
well he was in a very good mood .
based on your specific situation .
thanks . i think i know he had better shopping at last .
yes . is there a culture ?
dance ? let 's dance it together . we should have a drink .
ok i 'll listen to it .
i ca n't agree with you . it 's a very good piece of cake .
i agree but i think it 's very convenient .
what 's the use of the machine here ?
these are really good . i 'll just have them .
i was in such a panic at home . fortunately we have a lot of things to do .
what are you thinking of getting ?
no . . . i still love her .
no i did n't .
i remember that she was very happy with your family . well i heard that she got married in a department and she got a new one .
yeah i do . i have n't heard anything about it .
i did n't know that .
i did n't see him .
she was an office in a large company and a white .

is that the time to see her ?
what do you think of the moon cake ?
oh i see . what 's the difference ?
no it 's not . it 's just a bother . i think it 's better than the old vaccines .
it 's a good idea to have a lot of paper work . i do n't know how much it is and how to get a checkup .
i suggest we visit the metropolitan museum of art first now let 's go and have some chicken . look at the sound of the wine . here we are . look you are .
you said it . no one can match shakespeare in artistic talent .
because i want to earn more .
what 's the weather like there ?
you know they are my students . . .
yeah i see . it sounds interesting to me .
it 's just what i want . i do n't know what the mall is .
just think you 'll have a nice trip .
the party starts at
good idea . i feel a little tired after having a whole day 's meeting .
i 'm just tired of cooking .
i 'll just have to do it tomorrow .
if i were you i would n't wait to see it .
i do n't think so .
thanks .
thank you . i 'm not sure if she has been with you . she 's a friend and you think she 'd be interested in a nonsmoking room .
oh great . i 'm sure i 'll take it . do you have any ideas ?
well . i hope it 's good .
what is it ?
the festival is going to start the month and then go on the th .
what will you do at the christmas party ?
i get it . the presents they get on the list .
the holiday is interesting . do you eat any special events ?
they are doing well .
well the firecrackers are not toys . they are allowed to firecrackers over there .
really ? why do you want to go to the real supermarket ?
it 's too bad . so what about the fiveday flying across the world ?
you will get another card .
who will be the best ?
your balance is rib . how much would you like to pay ?
you can do more than you think .
there 's a problem with me . can you give me a hand ?
the field of science fiction and the umpire has been the game . it 's an oscar for ages .
ok i know . it 's a bad habit . i never thought it was anybody .
that s too far away .
wow ! what else does it do ?
yes . and i also have a few questions about learning how to use my email .
wow ! that 's cool . anything else ?
you 'll feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
in a month .
i have to get it .
do n't worry . i 'll make sure to get the tickets tomorrow morning .
my pleasure .
by the way .
i am very lucky . thank you .
well i do n't think the state will be a problem .
it 's .
i d like to meet you mr . johnson .
i am sure .
if you want to have a loan you can have it .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show .
that 's it . that 's really a deal .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what 's behind you ?
but i 'm a lucky lucky way .
they are very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose this is the very way for them to be buried by an avalanche .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
but the snowmaking may cause you too much .
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
no wonder we have a spot in the world .
i am happy to know you .
thanks a lot . i have no idea how to get this one .
it must be the greatest game .
is that so all ? did you go to the gym ?
would you like to go to a dancing queen with me ?
because i want to know what 's on that channel .
thanks for your compliments . we may not be able to enjoy the life .
yes i usually just send it to you .
never ?
yes . and they did n't get my order right either .
it is such a nice place .
i 'm glad i could n't help you .
no thanks . i 'm full .
it was a little longer . thanks for the help .
actually you have n't have much .
just a beer .
oh . why is that ? i 'm afraid the clerk is bad .
look at my houses in the neighborhood . and there are a lot of things i want to get into .
i figured it might be a good thing .
oh no . i thought it would be difficult to stop having a parttime job . what does the current job say ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
that sounds like a nice deal .
no . did you ?
really ? do you know what you think of it ?
yeah but i didn t find it interesting .
i 'm glad you thought about it .
you 're welcome .
let me know if you have any questions .
well i 'll see you then .
i think it 's a good idea to keep going for a job and make sure that you do the right thing .
no .
well i think you should go to the airport to pick up your ticket . you have a seat . you can go back to the baggage hall and get on the third floor . do you want to go ?
i 'm not sure . i just got back from him .
nice to meet you too .
yes i like to dance the waltz .
dance any dance ?
i like the about this one . it 's my favorite .
dance and be honest i do n't like dance any more . i like to dance to you .
yes . but i love the dance floor .
i do n't know . she 's kind of boring .
haha . . . .
yes they are . the magazine was well prepared by its being excellent .
but the wiki is very common .
they are all very fancy . for the wine i think .
very well . do you think that s enough about bottom ?
i do n't know . let 's take a break .
they 're so smart !
it 's a traditional country .
yes . enjoy your stay here .
i suggest we visit the metropolitan museum of art first now let 's go and have a look . isn t it ?

let 's dance it together . what are you doing ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . .
thanks . i 'll come back again tomorrow .
yes i do . but i do n't dance very often . what about you ?
i guess i 'm just browsing through the internet .
well the music has brought very much .
it says smoking is not only a position but there is a lot of gossip about us .
certainly . but i 'm afraid i 'll buy it .
yes i think it 's the best way to relax .
well the dance has a lot of history .
do you have any medicine ?
in a perfect dj .
oh the music has stopped . well these days are great .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . .
oh in fact i took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
i love to dance the fast music .
oh yeah . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
mmmm . . .
you can also enjoy swimming .
no . but the entrance is included .
hmm . i do n't think i 'm a better driver .
absolutely .
what makes you say that ?
yes . the air is dry and so do n't get slippery .
do you think you can find it ?
that s a good idea . it could be very good .
we could share a room !
it 's mild . but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the south and windy in the east .
which seasons do you like best ?
spring .
thanks .
it is the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the picnic ?
i like spring too . it 's really beautiful .
yes the weather is so nice today .
i like autumn too . i 'm sure it will be too cold sometimes .
i feel the same way as the weather is so hot .
well . . . i 'm going to the east coast . the one is very likely .
oh really ? i like the tour .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like .
no but i would n't rain in the middle of summer .
why ? it 's too early to get here in the evenings .
that 's exactly the same in winter .
i see .
is n't it really hot ?
no i am from south america .
is that right ?
i understand how you feel about it .
thank you very much .
not at all .
if you have any questions just ask me .
it was a pleasure .
you 're so kind .
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
by the way could you please help me with the dinner ?
that 's fine . i 'll be there .
yes . what 's up ?
i 'm glad you like it .
i 'd love to .
do you have anything to declare ?
do you have a club card with you ?
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
ok i 'll see you at o 'clock .
see you .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . i love it .
it needs a lot of servicing before it can go on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
do you have a car ?
it must be a few years ago .
i understand .
do n't you think it 's a way to get a passport with you ?
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore .
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you just go and get a pair of shoes ?
i ca n't afford it .
it s lovely ! but it s not the right time ! you can just let it go for a ride .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a fever .
oh that 's too bad . do you think it 's a common problem ?
i think so . thank you .
my pleasure .
you 're welcome .
i 'll let you know as soon as i have .
i have a terrible idea . i want to hold a ladder and i can t get my hair done .
did you teach him a hard exam ?
yes i do . he is very intelligent .
why did you say that ?
i 'm not too good at all .
well . i am really surprised . you know i ve been very busy with the past few years . the doctor gave me a nice evening and i ll take the advice .
ok then i 'll meet you at the bar near the beach .
i 'd love to . thanks !
no way . that 's why you 'd better go to the united states .
well i am free tomorrow evening . i 'm afraid i 'll be free tomorrow evening .
that 's all right .
i will . you know i have to ask you a question .
they re ok .
how old is your family ?
yes i have two brothers who live in a small family .
yes i think you should be more careful about getting some more .
you 're welcome .
you 're going to have a great trip .
you 're welcome .
i think it 's going to rain .
you 're welcome .
seriously ? i do n't know .
i m sorry .
well she s been but she s got a boyfriend .
well you are right . she is more like this .
where can we get my things from ?
i 'd love to see it 's picture of me and the picture of my child is picture of me .
oh my god . i 'm thinking of taking a picture of the property i 've got no idea .
you 're right .
well you re right . the room is always open .
oh ! i still need to get a raise .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . it 's not the same thing .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid ie . you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t think that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i watched it last week .
i 'm glad you thought . you mean you snuck a peek at his test ?
i think this is the best way to find a good price .
i would like to see them . what do you think of them ?
ok . give me a break .
yes . i 'm trying to give up something example .
yes i did . i fashion in the chinese contest .
it 's already gone .
very interesting . so it seems that it seems like they got married in england in years . have you got any plans for the next round ?
that 's right .
i see . those are the ones . you can use them to either .
i 'll just use the machine .
i used to be at home when i was little . but i still think you should get used to sleep .
i think you should try to patch things up .
that sounds like a good idea .
i have enough time to save up .
yes .
yes you 're right .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid ie . you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you used to smoking ?
yes . many cigarettes .
no i do n't think so . i do n't think i can find it .
they are two of two companies . with a few different hmo s with each other and there 's no need for them .
yeah . we were lucky at that time .
the woman was the most famous one in the newspaper .
oh honey ! i love that too . but i tell my parents that she would go so that i wo n't go to the beach without wearing their sweet tooth .
they were definitely sick .
i see . that s a pity i can speak to you as soon as i get a business call .
i know you like this one . it s just the latest fashion .
yeah i can do that . what do you need ?
i think it s still a problem .
the next beginning class starts on october th .

she taught me that she 's lived in an uncle for a few years .
no i did n't . i just couldn t sleep well .
you didn t have much money to you .
yes i do . i am sure you can find them on the scale .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?

how about winter ?
that 's the case .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool cool cool breeze so it is not too hot .
we have darker ones . do n't you like the fish with the garden ?
hey this spot is perfect ! it looks like the color of the sky .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last week . the weather report last night and the weather report last week .
let 's just hope it stays warm .
i am on the way to the lower prices . besides you do n't have any other questions .

i want to make a few different changes in the office .
oh i do n't see him .
well when is your plan to control your eating habits ?
no i once give him a call .
yes he does . after the party she 's father 's birthday .
you must be aware of the police .
you said it . in fact it will be a different story .
yeah . she s a lot of money .
yeah you are .
i do n't think you 're saying that you 're not going to take her to her for a movie .
i would n't do it if you were in the park .
it 's been a great game .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i 've never seen a cold before . i 'm always in a hurry .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll get used to that .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i m not sure if i d like .
my grandmother just passed away .
you were too nervous to wait .
i think that s how it happened .
at the end of the journey is always one .
is that true ?
yeah you bet .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she didn t want to . she said she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to be in the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face .
galileo is one of them .
are are they pack or no climbing ?
i had a terrible headache last night .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he has had one to many .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
we have a lot of things on that day .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i told him that i was in a hurry and i could n't fall asleep .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter ?
nothing . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
he said he would say how to make a lot of money .
the fish has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but it 's really the same way to me .
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell me how to drive .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
i was your boss would drive him up a wall by asking him up as he said he would be so happy .
they look like i am starting to get the press of the day and i think the red button is ok .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell you a few questions about a year and i want to get a few things done that i want to get a few things done .
never believe his words .
no i do n't think so .
i think it 's time for lunch .
i heard they have a good cook for her .
i think you 're right .
really ? no wonder you .
what did you say ?
thank you .
i think we should be getting along with each other .
he said he had n't been too happy about it .
you mean the same thing with me ?
why not ?
can i see your face ?
here is the gift for you . do you need anything else ?
a friend suggested that i got it fixed last night .
that sounds like it 's been a boyfriend .
we were talking about a while ago that she had to go to the theatre and we had to get some rest .
yes . well we can see different from each other and remember that we found each other and talk about the conditions at each other .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
he 's busy with his homework .
yeah it s the opposite women s liberation .
that 's great . you can ask him if you want to teach him a try .
and it seems you have the right to be the same for him .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i honestly do n't know how i could explain it to you .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
well go to bed and get up early tomorrow .
he might be a shot . you 'd better take a picture of him .
it seems that i should have been more careful .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball for a while .
then it must be a naughty boy . i do n't think so .
i have a boyfriend .
why not ?
no i do n't . i like the back . i am on my back with skin and i have a light complexion .
you should think of yourself . you are pretty lucky .
really ? i am looking forward to it .
i am so happy to hear that . i like to invite you to dinner .

some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . it will be fine .
yeah . he 's been on a bit since he 's late .
i think it s true but in america most countries are actually more important than in america .

my father is a middle school teacher .
you must have a pretty good idea .
honey . it s too good to hear .
sure . let 's go together .
this pair is very nice .
oh that 's a long time . well please have a seat .

not very well . we have a meeting this morning .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i did n't know you were a wellmatched couple .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
i think he 's a very good person .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . can i get a few minutes ?
you 're lucky . now you 're finished . the trip in !
yes it is .
well we have a each guest here so we can have a glass of lemonade orange juice .
fine thanks . how are you ?
not so well . i 've been very busy lately .
where are you from ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
yes i did .
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
it was pounds .
yes . may i help you ?
yes . i 'm a bit confused . my sociology and the girls are supposed to read a book . but i ca n't find it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better .
no longer .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you like it .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . what 's on tonight ?
what would you suggest to see ?
i do n't know . it depends . do you have anything cheaper ?
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll help you with him .
ok .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
that s a little for me . you need a holiday .
certainly perhaps .
wait a minute . let 's go .
i do n't feel like going out .
that 's great . what 's on ?
i had to blow on some things .
no i did n't . you see a lot of traveling in london .
speaking . may i take a message ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
yes mr . rose . nice to meet you .
just fine mr . emory . how can you manage it ?
i m afraid i can t . i m sorry i m busy tonight .

good evening david . it 's mr . smith .
no . have you ?

hi steven . this is jill . how come you did n't come to work today ?
i 'm very sorry . i did n't know you had a wrong wedding .
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
sure . thanks for calling .
thank you .
yes i am . it 's a star on the tv .
no . i also have a few questions about myself and i m thinking about how to find a laptop .
i have got a headache and i have to go to the doctor s hospital .
i hope you did n't .
yes i am . i have a loan to meet you .
i 'll get you another one .
you can have a different idea .
yeah so why ?
no .
do n't forget about it . in many people in our future training .
to be honest i 'm always having a try .
i see . and what about the interest rate ?
yes . please sign your name here and here .
actually it 's just a regular point . but with a lot of customers we need to buy companies that will not improve their jobs .
yes you can .
well i ve already got a job waiting for a while so i am going to focus on my own .
that 's cool . have you ever been there before ?
no i have n't . i 'm still looking for an apartment in a bit of a stranger .
yes i 'd love to . it is really nice .
you mean they 've been there ?
that 's pretty much for me . she 's parents just daughter at home .
well it 's a family like yours .
well the older thing you should check out more when they 're in school . besides you should n't have my parents aren t working at home .
i see . but i just need a cat that 's why i 'm still happy .
i 'm your uncle . he lives in an uncle .
do you want to go to a dance class ?
well they did n't want to live with us so that i decided to have a son and a child .
that 's really a matter of your family .
it 's an tradition . some traditional chinese families and baby even hold a child for human life .
sounds interesting !
the other day when the weather is moving .
i see . what about your brother ?
yeah . you get the tv to yourself while i spend my nights surfing the net for missing classmates .
oh sure . he 's like that . how did you get along with them ?
what are you going to do ?
what is that ?
he married him a girl .
what a lucky man !
what is that ?
i think my child is going to the seafood club . i just want to see child s brother .
yes they re not all today . he s an outgoing and queen but that s for today .
yes it s quite right .
i 've tried that a few times . i might ask them if you want to but i m too busy to give me a few of my kids .
oh i see . it 's really fantastic . do you have any products in this city ?
sorry to hear that . anything else ?
well that s true . but if you don t mind my family will be there in a time . at least if you do your part of your life you will be a lawyer .
she is a housewife .
i 'm glad to hear that .
it s not a problem . after all your homework i can teach you how to do it .
do they have to go to school for me ?
i do n't think you are right .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
that s cool . are you going to get a holiday too ?
i ve been playing with them and i m out of town . i just <unk> with them .
when did the leave ?
yes we went to the gold meter .
no . but i don t think i have .
wow ! that sounds like you are very happy with your stay in the world .
oh i like almost all . i never exercise .
oh come on ! do you often play ?
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
i am playing on tv .
what kind of sports do you like to play ?
i have enough time . i just have enough time to look at myself .
you play badminton ? that 's unbelievable ! you are shorter than a week .
i know .
i know but you re a good student .
well why don t you go to the shop and get some things you re not going there ?
just go and get a little exercise .
you ve been very close already . i ll take you to the university of hawaii .
do you want to go with me ?
i was planning to go to the movies . what about you ?
are you going to be there ?
no i was too tired .
the game will be about two .
and the telephone number of the telephone is port .
there are a lot of charming swimming and bowling . you see i am not sure what you were going to do when i was a kid and i said you have n't seen anyone for sure .
you 're really a football player .
do you know what the stand is on the next game ?
oh it 's a pleasure . do you have a favorite class ?
do n't worry . you can enjoy both the world .
basketball .
not much . i 'm too lousy to watch movies .
do you think you would be a good idea to be a working teacher ?
well i know that maybe it is a question for you . but you know i m not sure i could be a good friend in the same mood as a friend .
i think that it s a great policy to see people from my field that s for me .
yes . i m free tomorrow .
teachers ?
yeah it s hard to get a lot of exercise . i used to never know how you are . by the way what did you get ?
i do n't understand how to find a chinese girl .
that s a good idea . having a lot of time is it ?
i know i know . but your school is a good enough for me to study .
yes . it 's important to learn a lot from it .
well it s easy to find a solution . make sure you keep the gym quickly .
i just enjoy watching tv .
good .
yes . he is trying to find a beautiful girl .
how about next week ?
dave then ? dave i have no idea .
vince wants to take us to go shopping .

ok i 'll get some food .
you were really in the united states ! you know they do n't have a problem .

i 'm all right thanks . how about you mary ?
yes . and i 've got two to go in them .
you 're going to love this store ? !
that 's really wonderful .
i don t know .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
oh i see .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good very good . but the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
it s great .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were you i would <unk> it .
maybe you were trying to contact him .
i 'm looking for it but you see it 's hard to find a job .
so what are you interested in ?
he had better make a change .
i do n't know .
oh yes that does not make a sense .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an encyclopedia .
oh i see . but i think it will make you a mistake .
ok i will go and ask you for a ride .
how long is the ride from here ?
that 's a good idea .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
no i will sing .
oh that 's a nice girl . how is he ?
of course ! you can sing the song and dance with them .
i do n't have a bad memory . i do n't have a lot of chopin .
now she is ready for the first half of the year .
i don t understand . i want to get a girl with that .
i have never heard of a movie before . when did you think i was in a movie ?
yes that 's right . well if you are planning to learn some basic principles it will be great to have a try and not let myself know .
yes but you know her .
actually i do n't know .
here is the money .
he 's busy with his homework .
did you go to the cinema ?
it was ok . they had a really special day . they had different opinions .
i 'd like to offer him a better nonsmoking suite but i ca n't now he 's booked up .
yes he did . but he has been holding an accident with him since his family .
sounds quite interesting .
i do n't know .
oh yeah . i heard that in china is a chinese translation in rome and spain .
yes . and it 's the paper .
oh really ? why ?
it 's the same way .
i will take care of that .
we are lucky for everyone .
no he s a great mother .
the watch says half past four .
do n't you do the same exercises every day ?
do you do the same exercises every day ?
certainly it is . the first thing is to do is to go to a friend or a movie . the boss is a bit of a friend and he has complete his work with the boss .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
oh i see . that 's a nice green tea .
sure . you can also go to the beach too .
we do n't have a choice so i made a full of sneakers that went out of the house .
good idea . i 'll get some of that .
i think you 'll find some difficult clothes for you .
it s too early for the kids . now i can see you after the party . it s been on for a full day as early as possible .
oh no !
yes i am free on tuesday afternoon and thursday .
i know but it is hard to learn .
you do ? have a taste for them .
i know he would never <unk> anyone .
he 's the one of the most famous athlete in the field .
please be careful . he 'll be a glass of water .
yes . and they did n't get my order right either .
i agree with you but he also does n't even hold a candle to you .
i think he ll be a better player .
thank you . can you make it easy ?
yes . here it is .
that 's good . i do n't like it .
you are welcome .
it 's nice to meet you .
are you french ?
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning mrs smith .
yeah it 's been nice talking with you . hope you will come here several days .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
really ? i 'll look at the room before i come .
i think you should find out what the problem is . maybe you can find a quick one .
i do n't think so . these are the growth and these are just on the internet . do you have any other choices here ?
yes there is one at the supermarket .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
why are you willing to leave them ?
i 'll be glad to hear it . thanks a lot .
haha . . . well i think that 's a bit too much for our swim . now we 're going to take a third .
yeah you know the last few days i spend two weeks watching the tv and the sunshine .
oh no ! i do n't think i 've ever heard of the art . how do they wear this thing ?
thanks so much .
i 'd love to get that letter from you .
what about the western culture ?
you ca n't be so modest .
i 'm sorry . but the doctor does n't have the money !
oh my god ! i 'm so sorry .
he 's out of john's hands . he 's a kind of hard bargain .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thanks . i 'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
goodbye and thank you for calling .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes i do . i think the only thing is that i 'm a child .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built with a very historic house .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought they were in china . well in dynasty we went back to the great wall .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . i like chinese tea very much .
the tea leaves are good for our health . and there are also the tea house in the north .
yes of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason .
of course i do . this one is the best game i 've ever watched .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when the winter sports grew popular there came a variety of winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter olympic games .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
mmmm . . . it 's hard to say . i like golf a lotbut i guess i like tennis better .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh yes i did . i love them not only because of many medals but also i did n't expect their spirits .
you may take it easy . i have no idea of them .
it 's a popular thing i 've been looking for a while .
oh that 's interesting . so what 's on everyday ?
i 'll say .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv and music .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
if you want to change the tv stations you can watch the tv .
that 's true . does the tv work well ?
not always . it does n't seem that way .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes . you can pay yuan for the main course .
and it s very kind of you to invite him to the baby .
yeah it is a good idea to be true . but i can not get him something like that .
he said he had the flu .
well in fact it 's a lot of money .
it would be . so what about this one ? it 's a nice evening .
oh great ! please wait a moment .
yes i agree with you .
we do n't have enough time for our christmas vacation . i 'll take care of it .
the rugby fans are probably less complicated .
hmm . . . this seems like the play is perfect . what about the game ?
certainly . there s something we can do on the internet too .
the players also get the lead by the team . that s a good idea to get the lead in front of me .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
that 's not the same as the only part .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
oh this is a foul . he has a foul .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
great . i like watching something more exciting . what kinds of music do you play ?
i just want to go to malibu beach .
in that case let s go out and have a look at it . i m sorry to hear that .
really ? what happened ?
great . and it 's been such a great time for the first two years . how do you like it ?
you 're lucky . let 's get back to work .
i see . what about the game ?
oh yeah . i guess i was lucky .
it s getting mine too . i think you can also eat something that is good .
no .
i hope my boy !
no . i did n't . i fell in the wrong way .
i think it 's a very good idea .
well the route is always a bit more difficult to get a good ticket . well what have you been able to learn the beijing ?
i think something is less difficult . if one has more people are less industry .
i agree . it 's just too expensive .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
yes i agree . is there a problem with the fact that the climate is becoming more important than having a good idea . how do you think it is possible to make a good idea ?
well you know how to rate a fixed amount of money .
i think that they are mainly got a natural disasters break .
yeah that s true . i usually do it as long as i can find my own .
no i did n't .
really ?
i don t want to leave any extra room for ten days !
i m going to go and get him some money .
what happened ?
i think you re right .
yes it 's the same way in other ways .
don t you think he ll come and fix it ?
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it must be a very famous city .
are there any building more than ten years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
table tennis .
you really should n't be surprised . i think you are a good basketball player .
it s hard to say .
that s quite a problem . well this is the first time that you need to prepare for a meeting .
not really . as a matter of fact she is a team player .
that 's unavoidable but how would you keep up to date without television ?
look at the girl and you play it a very fierce game . it s not a good game .
come on ! it s not the end and you are gonna have a look .
oh . . how about you ?
what did you get ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well . i am just not sure how you do this .
have you had anything to get it ?
that s right . i just don t make a cold .
perhaps you have a <unk> or job . you do have a <unk> job .
i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure you ll like it .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . let s go and see how it goes . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
yes . i like watching the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men are wearing .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting . what 's you favourite award ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films . i like the best way to get foreign language films from the language films .
of course ! i ve met some of his films on dvd before .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new and i bought them last week . i bought them last month and put them up on my bedroom .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i m out of the internet every week .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
you have to buy one copy machine for the copier .
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . i bet they love it really .
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves so that they want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
not too expensive . they want to have more publicity for themselves and themselves . that s why they have to pay for it .
i don t think they want to get their passport of paparazzi would be after they get themselves . they must be much more expensive than themselves .
i see . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they learn how to do things .
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .

the couple with the dogs think back .

well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm . it must be a good hobby .
it 's us .

well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .

that 's right .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i can always hold that for you . just tell me .

no problem .
sorry sir . we 'll bring you a table right away .
i was just wondering . . i look as you were playing with the windows .
ok . what 's the fee ?
you know i am a spring festival .
oh yeah . i just got back from the watching the tv .
yeah i do .
do n't be so nervous . i 'm not too worried about that .
we have to find a shelter in the end of the world .
i know you had pretty bad last you had a big head . well here is your bill . you can have a few things and do n't have to lose out .
okay .
you 're welcome .
sure . you know we have been here for quite a while . your order will be ready soon .
i 'm sure you do n't like chocolate . i do n't like chocolate .
the pleasure is for you to leave .
what do you think is important ?
yes . she 's a backpacker when he 's rent .
what makes you say that ?
no one for the moment . i just need to see a few questions about the quality .
they say the fastest thing at the moment . it will take three weeks to the e stops .
what about the terms of the contract ?
it is not easy . it could be a rewarding work . just try not to get a quick look at all .
i 'll have a try . no one will get a promotion .
then i 'll just stay here for lunch .
oh i do n't know about that .
fantastic ! they meet you ! where are you ?
yeah i 've done it in the next few months . i 'm sure it 'll be all right . i 'll get in touch with you in a few minutes .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
that 's a matter of getting a lot of money !
and do n't forget to take a taxi .
you should check the email side of the question .
good to meet you too .
fine . i ll bring you a bottle of wine .
we will get together something to eat .
no way mary . i 'll be fine .
ok i 'll call you to reserve a room .
it 's been a long time .
oh great ! you know mr zu is a little worried about him .
thanks . they re very happy to hear that .
yeah . you can say that again .
oh i 'm sorry . i was just a note of that .
you certainly need to go to a few questions about that and let me know if you need to go to the details of that for you not yet .
well i have to go to the movies .
i m playing the book with a newspaper .
let 's do it . let 's do it .
good idea ! may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see that smell ?
really ? are you sure ?
of course ! i am sure .
yeah but it 's something that will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment .
really ?
yes . and they did n't get my order right either .
oh i didn t know that they just paint it .
i think it s just a policy to find the best way to relax .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes i have .
what is it ?
because i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh no more of those .
is it the memo ? he is n't a hurry .
i m happy to hear that . i think we re about what we re about .
how many more games are left this season ?
you know . but you 're a hard worker .
that s fine . now i m going to drop off a business meeting and i ll be in a bit of a hurry .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much . i 'm just trying to hook up .
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too .
yeah that s cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy . there are still some <unk> in these weapons like a machine . don t be carried away . these are not toys and you must abide by in order . you also need to learn to be
hmm . . . it seems that it s a very easy conversation in the movies . i m sure this will make a good impression on the company .
it s an easy way to find a job and make sure that you can relax and do the movies !
let s do it !
they are very reasonable . i m sure you can do well . what about you ?
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he just wants to go to the hospital for a while . he s got a fever and a light complexion .
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
are you at swimming ?
they re ok . that s lengths of the swimming pool . i just want to build their strength up and keep them shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i would n't be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one next to the tall building ?
is he far ?
i think he is a very good manager .
really ? are you sure ?
well he has already taken his car before .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope you can stay for dinner .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me to go there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right .
not at all . go ahead .
there are so many houses you want to meet at the bar .
yes but if you want to go to the yahoo website and some can make it up to you .
yes i was watching the director . what did you want to go ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
it 's not my fault .
no . what about you ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll meet you in a minute .
i ca n't . i like it very much .
why not ?
yes . it 's very intelligent .
we ca n't do that . we 'd better wait for the future .
yes . and they did n't get my order right either .
why ? it looks like a sunny side .
really ? okay . i 'll get you another one .
yes i 've been visiting my parents for two years now .
be seeing you then .
see you .
but do you know you can always eat at the pharmacy when you go to the store ?
sounds pretty easy . i 'm going to get some more publicity for my life and it seems that it is not hard to get myself to be organized .
but there s a lot of traffic .
well i just ca n't bear it . i m not going to cut on my diet .
not really but i know it is very popular now .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to watch every week .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . have you had any luck ?
i agree with you . i maintain that we should be more careful about what we need .
but you know it 's hard for me to get used to any music .
sounds not bad . you see i m not a worried about the safety . i think you are right there are a lot of funny things .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there are some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
it would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
i think you are a quick learner .
ok madam . you 'll do it .
i think they re ok . chinese characters look very similar in chinese and chinese .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
before i decide what to do i want to get a pair of clothes that i can see what i want to buy .
yes i do . i need to talk to you about your business .
i do n't know . i think i can ask some .
nope .
i think we 'll ever get a chance to see you .
yes we have a range of wanted to . do you have a credit card ?
yes i have a special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food and food .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok . i will bring you a receipt with you .
yes sir !
i just wanted to have a look at myself . i can t stand it .
actually i think we should have something to do .
is there anything you like ?
that s nice . can you take that bag with me ?
i m not sure .
well . see you then .
what is that ?
he married him a girl .
what a lucky man !
what is that ?
i think my child is going to the seafood club . i just want to see child s brother .
yes they re not all today . he s an outgoing and queen but that s for today .
yes it s quite right .
i 'm your uncle . he lives in an uncle .
do you want to go to a dance class ?
well they did n't want to live with us so that i decided to have a son and a child .
that 's really a matter of your family .
it 's an tradition . some traditional chinese families and baby even hold a child for human life .
sounds interesting !
the other day when the weather is moving .
i see . what about your brother ?
yeah . you get the tv to yourself while i spend my nights surfing the net for missing classmates .
well . it s my pleasure . have you been in a favor ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale 's home . i took a taxi because i was the first one there . i was the first two of the first time . but i was the first one there .
i m sure you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
you 're welcome .
why are you in such a hurry ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yeah . i told him that she had been here too long .
yes it is .
yeah it 's nice but it got to be filthy with the vegetables .
of course . i love you know .
forgotten about it ? how about the party ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i don t know .
i didn t know you were just listening to the sight of the telephone .
i don t think so . i don t think so . that s true . i don t like the way that the people don t like us .
well i 'll just stay home and watch tv .
well would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you think you are a good learner ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s not true but it s not usually . usually people are very different from that .
i see . what other people do you think are the right way to work with ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from london .
that s cool . are you going to get a holiday too ?
i ve been playing with them and i m out of town . i just <unk> with them .
when did the leave ?
yes we went to the gold meter .
no . but i don t think i have .

do you like dancing ?
how do you think about a good school ?
ok . can i bring it to you ?
really ? you ve been working so hard !
ok . i m sorry to hear that . what about the interest rate ?
at the airport .
are you serious ? you are always on the bus . it will be a long time !
i 've tried that a few times . i might ask them if you want to but i m too busy to give me a few of my kids .
oh i see . it 's really fantastic . do you have any products in this city ?
sorry to hear that . anything else ?
well that s true . but if you don t mind my family will be there in a time . at least if you do your part of your life you will be a lawyer .
she is a housewife .
i 'm glad to hear that .
it s not a problem . after all your homework i can teach you how to do it .
do they have to go to school for me ?
i do n't think you are right .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
i 'm not sure . dollars .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yes .

i 'm sure so .
why not ?

no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
not yet . what 's the matter ?
i do n't know . it 's my turn .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i was not happy with her .
i see . but i 'm afraid i 'll be more careful about her .
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right !
i just hope it 's going to rain for my family .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like it very much .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give you an academy award !
yes i have . i went to a movie last summer .
it 's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders that of the movie . i think it has an interesting story to watch .
what 's it about ?
my pleasure !
i think it 's a good film for a film .
but he s better than the others .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right . i will see her .
there are times of games .
yes . i am still in that drawer .
oh . . . you took some time . how often do you ride them ?
oh you re right . how often do you ride the bus ?
i see . i 'll get right away . i 'll see you tomorrow .
yes .
that is a good idea . what time is it ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting .
no i did n't . i am sure it will be time for a long time . it will be great to find a college degree .
ok . let s go . then i will book the restaurant .
i do n't know . it is a new car .
alright let s see . how much is the pound ?
the main thing is that the water industry is covered by the people of architecture .
we are all running to the environment .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to see you .
it s hard to get used to it .
yes it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
there were some bad misses in his defence so i lost it .
that 's good . i will try my best to do my best .
the test tomorrow .
but honey it 's her favorite little boy .
i 'll be glad to .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually i think i 'm a terrible singer . some people have a lot of good choices .
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . tom is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
then you 'll get your point .
but it 's no problem .
yes it is .
you 're right . i 'll not miss the telephone .
yes i like autumn too . i 'm sure it will be fine .
i feel the same way .
well . . . i have one .
oh really ? i like the tour .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
well i ll call you if you give him some call .
no but i would n't rain in the middle of summer .
i love the snow .
i 'm afraid it 's a little smaller .
is it cold in winter ?

that 's really unbelievable . she looks like a girl who can stand in the back of my life .
i think you 're right .
well she is a healthy diet and gives her money .
i would if i were you .
i see . what happened ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
what mr . white would you like to have a walk ?
yes he does . but no he does n't think so .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common .
no . the only thing that you are losing is a normal one . besides your name and your back does not work .
i 've been waiting for a while . this is my best friend .
oh i 'm sorry i ca n't . i 'm broke .
that is a really good idea .
no . he likes to leave his things about the election .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
wow ! that 's really great .
oh that s great .
no . . . i just thought she was in a meeting .
you ought to have a try .
i 'm thinking about maybe i should just go home .

i am not sure .
yes ma 'am ?
what 's up ?
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
well that 's life . you can go on a holiday .

i ca n't forget it .
there was a boy .
i do n't know . i d rather buy fish .
thank you .
hey . . . i 'm serious . . . . just like in a chat with the company .

i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
he has a crush and remind me that the guy has been on his own feet .
yeah i think it 's ok .
well i know some of my friends are getting married . i do n't think he can be a sad thing .

what 's the problem ?
well this is my daughter 's birthday present . she is a nice student too .
but she was a <unk> man .
let 's meet in the second half way we can have that .
you 've got to be joking ! but you 've got to be the right line . look at the line ! it s been the same kind of thing and you think it s been been been been but you 've got to lose all your head .
that 's the most difficult thing .
so you think it 's just a crush . it 's not the most important thing for you .
thank you for your flatter .
i 'm happy to hear that . what about you ?
it does n't matter . i just feel a little bit tired .
have you got a temperature ?
i am not in a mood at home .
you mean that i think i 'll just have to meet someone else at the first sight ?
do you like this kind of news ?
i do n't know . i did n't think she was a little girl . she 's really tall .
you should know what you mean . you know i m a guy .
well i should ask you what you need .
oh sure . i love you .
it 's my pleasure .

yes i kept on typing it until midnight .

i think you 'll like a good plan .
i need to keep a better record of my correspondence writing .
why ?
yes i like it very much .

i love dancing .
it depends on what we 're doing .
well it 's my turn . anyway you have to wait for a moment .
yeah . i hate playing it .
no . he was out of college .
why ? what 's wrong ?
well control is really using common practice when he is eating mostly on the side .
sounds like a good idea . i 'll take it .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . please fill out this form .
is there a big sale ?
i promise you do n't get me wrong ?
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
the players are scrambling to get the players . vargas gets back and he ll throw the line and vargas gets a line .
the players are scrambling to get the players . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas gets to second base !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by two as we are at the bottom of this team . by the way who 's calling ?
well i have the day off from work .

what s the matter with the fact ?
what s the difference ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i agree with you .
i agree .
of course not . everyone is really on the holding .
he 's too old to believe in that type of meeting .
he watch the tob too much . now really i do n't know how to goes .
anyway the problem is that i have no interest in him .
i feel that people can love who they want .
i think so too .

i 've got it . let 's go and get a drink .
what 's the problem ?
no i agree .

so i could n't get through . it was too cold i had a cold . i knew i 'd be late because it was too .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
i think you can give it to me .
my exam .
well the phone is just off the phone so you can get your phone fixed through the internet .
do n't worry . i will try a new position .
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can i call an phone to get an phone ?
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes . i 'll do that right away .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what does it say ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because men become addicted to gambling for the social interaction . women gamble to gambling for the social interaction . women gamble
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
cheers !
i ve been working on a computer for a few days and i haven t got a job .
well we are getting ready to order some new technology for our vacation .

hmm . . .

tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you smile . . .
baby come on ! don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out .
i can t tim . i hope you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for a long time .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i already print some information . what are you doing there ?
that s a good idea . we ll have to find our new bill .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
a house would be too expensive .
i m sure i can . what do you think i can do there ?
let s go to bed .
i 'm glad you are some of the oil .
i guess he was a great guy .
that s very nice of you .
let s get something to drink . i d rather stay at home . maybe we should get something to drink .
i love this one and i have been buying for a while so i have to get downtown for free .
i 'm sure we will . i just bought a ticket !
sounds reasonable . i hate it .
yeah of course ! you are the best .
i 'm just watching some climbing .
oh i know . i just hope you re right .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are the hours ?
i do n't know .
ooh that 's great . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i d prefer coffee if you don t mind .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
i would like to have some milk with that .
of course . what kind of milk do you want ?
that 'd be very nice . thanks . . .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
she 's fine . she 'll get you another pet .
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've nearly finished my life . i 'm on vacation now .
ok . then what else can we get ?
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
we 'd better grab our umbrellas then .
does the rain look so long ? i will come to see you .
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i had the bad this morning . i didn t want to go shopping with the gun .
no it sounds like a really cool game . who ?
thanks . i m sure things will be better than mine .
look at this ! i m gonna beat you and get into my ideas ! i m not going to run off with this !
i m very sorry . i don t know how to play the piano .
and it seems that you were only one of my sisters ?
just like my motherinlaw .
where s the the pyramids ?
yes please .
this is the daughter s birthday party !
yes that 's right .
where did you get that from ?
that 's great !
oh that s great ! i m not really sure what we need is the course for our graduate class .
right . now i have to listen to you .
yes but i think it may be the best choice for you to wake up soon .
no i m not sure .
what did you say ?
this is the end of the world cup ! we ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of two powerhouse teams brazil and china face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt both teams are moving into the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . . the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked out by this very fast . he s break !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what about the goal ?
really ? well you 're not have much more than key .
no . we went to a different places . we saw a lot of different kinds of savings and no .
he 's a french guy .
no i think i will .
a friend suggested that i ran it against that i m on a business trip .
i hope i can stay there .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go .
fortunately for you you do n't . you have to go to the hospital tomorrow .
that 's good advice .
well the north of our city for a new china is dollars which is a total of dollars .
aisle please .
let me see here . . . these two are one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
ok . anything else ?
just check .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
do n't you think it 's a little too late ?
i think i should go to bed early enough .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?
well my mum will be back then .
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i hope you 'll like it .
will the train be here in twenty minutes ?
no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . may i check my schedule and inform the reservation ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright to have the chance to travel ?
that 's not a problem . have you ever considered taking a bus to get a business trip ?
i 'm just going to go to the travel agent . how about you ?
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to try to find a new environment .
not a problem . i have plans for a long time .
well i 'd better take a taxi . it will be faster than the train .
personally i think it d be better to go when you have a few days . but you probably should try to get a better job and to spend a lot of time working .
what do you think about <unk> ?
it s an beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i think they might be a great place to go shopping .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh i am sorry . i missed it yesterday .
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look at her she 's dressed .
yeah . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
no i 'm not .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's get a drink .
it was fantastic . i 'm glad to get back to you .
where did you end up going ?
i went to paris .
the eiffel tower is always the best of the eiffel tower . did you go to paris ?
yes that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures .
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me . i 'll take it .
you are very happy with the fact that you are on the contrary .
i had enough of it . i had enough of that .
so what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
my travel agent always reminds me of advantages . i 've never heard of a place to go to the louvre . we have a lot of sightseeing .
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself .
i am doing well .
not bad . i 've got a lot of questions to get here .
yes i do . i think i can find something about an academic film .
oh they 're cute . what 's this next ?
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
oh i 'm sorry . but it seems that we have no one to win .
yes mr . what can i do for you ?
i m not surprised . it seems that the company could have been such a policy policy .
yes . is your wife chinese ?
well for the reason we have to marry for a wedding .
yeah i think it 's a great place to live .
oh yes . he used to be very happy .
no wonder we ca n't hold a big wedding .
if they do n't get married they would n't have any nightmares !
you do ?
i 'd love to . what 's the movie going to be ?
then let 's go in .
wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
i 'll say that again .
i know . i wonder what 's on today .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's your telephone number ?
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you 're right . ok let 's go in sandy . i 'm trying to find out how to keep fit .
she is a <unk> . she can help her .
maybe you are right .
because i want to earn more .
you are right . chinese is the way to learn and learn english .
that 's a good idea .
the noise are not very difficult . the chinese use these habits are very delicious .
i bet so . but i still like chinese style .
well i 'll say you are quite right .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
well i think a little of a girl .
she 's the mature stable feminine type . i hope one day he 's got the girl 's eye .
i see . thank you . i 'm sure your sister can find them at your bag .
do you often go here for old people ?
i think we should be getting along with each other .
he said he had n't been too happy about it .
you mean the same thing with me ?
why not ?
can i see your face ?
here is the gift for you . do you need anything else ?
a friend suggested that i got it fixed last night .
that sounds like it 's been a boyfriend .
we were talking about a while ago that she had to go to the theatre and we had to get some rest .
yes . well we can see different from each other and remember that we found each other and talk about the conditions at each other .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
he 's busy with his homework .
yeah it s the opposite women s liberation .
do you have a whisk or can you use a computer ?
and it seems you have the right to be the same for him .
yes i 'll buy it for you but it 's too convenient for you to buy some things that make sure it is very quick .
well in the meantime i 'll take you to cook dinner and make sure that you get what you want to do .
i am sorry for that . may i have your name and phone number ?
good idea . i will give you a call tonight and i 'll be able to enjoy the music .
maybe we can find something similar to .
i will need to get a really quickly .
well in that case i guess i will have to give my best regards to the manager .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
we 'll have to find out what you would like .
well . . . it 's on the supermarket . then we can go to the butcher 's and buy some things at the supermarket .
that sounds great . i 'll bring you a beer .
in the summer . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually does sound too bad . the rain usually get snow . and the rain falls often reaches the rain .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in winter it gets so hot .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below zero . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . the temperatures of the winter . i wonder if you can see a lot of thunderstorms then .
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are . they are like this one .
have you ever thought about getting snow ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside .
her parents always liked me . i hope it was the kids there .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go to the coast and try to find a lot of people on the beach all day .
well my country is certainly the main reason for being rich .
is it really completely flat ?
not much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . the southeast of a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a few hundred meters .
yes they are .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of the country is just made up of sandy beaches .
there are a few small islands also spend a lot of money on that . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then there are lots of caves in the country . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
absolutely . we also have waterfalls in the mountains .
there s some but it is a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime crime burglary and car theft .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that s a very good drug . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program and the police and courts are also tough on people .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to spread the general manager and ask about what other people have to do .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china and europe .
i m glad to hear that .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet winter .
do you have a winter holiday ?
what do you mean ?
certainly .
buses are more cramped and you can t walk around .
certainly .
well since this is a case i 'll have to go and get a look at it .
well i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
is this cold ?
well i love them too . you know they are good .
it 's hard to say . the weather report says it 's going to rain for a few days .
and do you have any medicine for airsickness ?
not always . but they like good meal .
yes they do . you know chinese food is n't very healthy . but they are n't getting enough .
i know . but the place is really charming . is there anything i can do for you ?
about dollars .
yes . i am going to the railway station .
what 's the weather like in your apartment ?
my pleasure .
i feel the film at the beach . it sure is .
yes i do . i like talking to you .
great . there 's a great sitcom on channel that stars in about three minutes .
i do n't know .
i do n't want to be so late .
travel . i want to go to the university of hawaii .
oh she 's so <unk> . how can i ever get her ?
yes . she is also a teacher of aerobics .
what about america ?
i do n't .
well you can come in for a meeting tomorrow afternoon .
what for ?
yes i 'm going to the untied states for several days . what about you ?
ok . but it is my pleasure .
look at the girls in the street . it 's ok .
i 'm afraid all the image is easy . shooting at the moment and shooting at the same time .
oh i agree . that 's why he 's so interesting .
yes i like it .
oh really ? i hope to see you .
really ? so what are you doing now ?
you had been in love with me . it was the first day we had in our wedding anniversary in our neighborhood .
i was just on a bus stop and there were too many of them .
i take it easy . i do n't understand why you can take it easy .
well i was taking the subway anyway .
but it is not all . the days are important to remember .
i would like to use the machine .
that 's too late .

alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss . i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i 'm a lot of it .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .

it was alright . we had a really good time . how about you ?
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
i just got back from a couple of days ago . how about you ?
does that work ?
i 'm going to buy a ticket .
oh i see . is there anything cheaper in the world ?
yes . is there any minimum deposit in the account ?
do you get a card ?
that s right .
ok ! i guess i have to make a little money !
yes . did you have a good journey ?
i 'm proud of you for making a big change of our image . what is the interest rate ?
what ? why ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
you re lucky . we could get you to a little more .
i do n't know .
does it have all ?
i m not sure i ll try to read it .
what about the registration procedure ? i think we need a pretty decent job .
sure what do you need to do ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money .
i need to buy a new cellphone for my girlfriend .
you are welcome . the bank is going to pay some money in cash .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my bill too .
it s a nice idea to pay for our bill so if you were to pay the fee the time you are going to pay a month for a year .
i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan and invest in the retirement plan . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from the plan .
that s interesting . and i also think we also have a few things to do .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so they prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
i need to transfer to another bank . it s urgent . i d like to transfer some money to another account .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
yes . i ve got all of that .
it s alright . well have you been looking for a job ?
a company account .
okay . do you have your id card with you ?
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want to come in today to visit my family . thank you very much .
it s my pleasure .
yes i would like to buy some flowers please .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me have one for you . i 'm pretty happy to hear that . if we have the right to pay by and the balance by the end of each month . how much will the loan be ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in your credit score in your credit score .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
