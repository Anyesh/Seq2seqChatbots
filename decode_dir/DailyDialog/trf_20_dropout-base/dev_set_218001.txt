i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .

i believe it .
okay . i 'll take it .
i d better take it back to the monitor .
ok . i 'll change it .
yes .

cool .
okay what can i get you ?
no . i bought it the wrong size .

i 'm a good mom you should ask her .
i work here as a trainee every morning . i plan to work overtime if i m working on a company .

well not much . we play games all the way to play .
so what 's the problem ?

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
your parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .

your daughter usually does the dusting and i do the vacuuming .

oh how far is it ?
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that s going to be a little order .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada <unk> for of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than you get a voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
of course . there is a changing room behind you .
yes i 'd like to have a look at the piece suit .
this is kevin .
that 's a good idea . i have a friend .
what kind of stuff do you need ?

the list goes on and on . here this is your bill .
hi . i need to report a breakin .

i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted

so how about an <unk> ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you . will you be paying in cash or by credit card ?
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .

it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
yes i do n't like ice cream .
yes what about your favorite effects ?

i 'll take care of these days .
french dressing is my favorite .
i have no idea .
haha . i 've never had any kind of stuff like you .
we have caviar foiegras lox cold beef sour cucumber .

what s wrong ?
what do you mean by that ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
i do n't like the food .
thanks a lot . we will have the same thing as your christmas in the world .
oh we 're not sure . is there a price of trains where they sell then ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
where did she say ?
is she easy to get home ?
oh yes . she is very <unk> .
that 's not enough .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
just leave them here and find out where you are .
do you know if there is a football game on my first floor ?
perhaps you could be able to help me in the future .
are you scared of anything ?
i 'm glad you 're out of luck .
why ?
may i know what you do ?
so you have to drive yourself to work ?
who are you going to be okay ?
this is really nice exercise .
but i ve never seen such a place that is for some time .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
you 're supposed to be late today .
goodbye randy . take care .
why ?
you may be there with the boss .
ok .
i know . let 's just get the bill .
yes such as clothes and climbing there are lots of children .
do you have your ever been living with them ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
all right . do n't worry . i 'll take this one .
he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
oh that 's terrible ! she will be staying at home .
i 'll get her to you right away .
what was she wearing ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
only about twenty minutes .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello . could you help me with my room ?
what happened ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .

john i am .

well i live here every single then .
it was not . i just did n't go to it again .
yes if i do n't mind my work i think .
oh i just tried to listen to your voice . i just want to listen to your voice .
that 's all right .

you are always washing clothes here .
do you think we need to make a call before four .

how can i get that ?
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having a sale ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
sure ? why ?
i just wanted to say i was n't very interested in the shop and i wanted to look for myself .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
no problem . please double check it in the form .
no it 's easy . just take it easy .
we ? do you want to go with me ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .

oh yes . they 're glad you called them .
you are welcome !
it 's a job that you can appeal to the price of our customers .
what is the price ?
it 's about years old .
what kind of food do you like ?
i bought it but it already was still cheaper .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do you want to sit down ?
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i 'll take it . i want to cool yourself .
what kind of things i get ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
why are you interested in making this investment ?
that 's the most important thing .
why do n't you call me ?
what time would you like to take the test ?
before next friday .
for sure .
your flight takes off at
i understand . could you please do it ?
i 'm not sure yet . could you do it tomorrow ?
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
fine . we are going to bring you a refund of money right now .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i want to know about it .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . the seed of course is humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
well . i was just thinking of getting some money . you see me tomorrow .
they are two different wholesale vendors so it 's a dollar each bag .
that 's unbelievable . oh that 's unbelievable .
that 's the most interesting thing you like .
mmm .
you can buy them hard . the soft ones with higher ones but you can only eat them .
i 'll take some . how much are they ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?

well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

what makes you say ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
do n't mention it .
i see .
hi lucy are you free to talk ?
sure just give me a break .
oh i have got it .
yes i am .
how many do you want ?
no thanks . all the sightseeing to get .
just a moment please .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
why did he go to the gym ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
hi linda .
i 've been to new york . i 've been to several days now .
i m fine . only he is doing well .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh fine . you 've got a really busy day .
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
you are welcome .
what is the weather need to see your daughter ?
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working there for two years .
thank you .
oh he 's like it .
what is your strongest trait ?
this one is ok . the phone was bound to wind it while driving the minutes or more convenient .
he used to be a illegal movie but he could n't do that well .
ok .
good for you . goodbye .
ok i will . thanks for coming .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
please drive me ! i 've got plenty of car . how many miles to do it .
all right i will go down and tell you what is going to do .
why not ? i thought we had a close one and then prepare how many things to get ready !
what 's wrong with it ?
ok ! how should we do this thing ?
well i don t know what to get ! i ve had a camera for my birthday party .
ok i ll be finished soon .
are you aware of anything ?
i 'm looking for a new bedroom .
what color are you looking for ?
oh i like a laptop . i think i ll just have a look at the kitchen .
you need to put all your clothes on the scale .
ok .
sure .
i 'd also like to say goodbye to the interviewer again .
so you re pretty good at other options ?
yeah the night after tomorrow it rains .
i can t agree with you .
okay . thank you .
hmm . . . i guess it does n't have bad news .
what 's it like ?
when can i stop ?
oh yeah .
oh dear ! i m so sorry !
really ? what 's the matter ?
no problem just ask me if you need any more help .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i need more than just now . what else do i need ?
well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do you have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
that is the best thing to call me .
i guess we ve had enough room to get up .
you know i know . you can t use it anytime .
it 's really . it 's almost the same as the house . it seems like a stain on the floor .
i see .
hey look at this one . it 's a little expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are a new pair . i m going to get these jeans as well .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i know but we have a lot of space so i d like to get a new one .
i have n't thought of that .
it is wonderful .
and how much does it cost ?
the rent is per month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do ?
you can get a commission of the check .
i can t stay here though .
how much money can you stay ?
i go to the gym every day .
i am the best choice .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah it 's a real chinese food . i 'm not sure how to cook it .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly sir . what kind of dress do you like ?
what can i do ?
the blue one 's fine .
there 's no problem with it .
great . do you think the same by air ?
that s ok . let s take a look at it this time .
yes . i like the design . you can see i ve also got these new clothes . we need these new shirts too .
i need them to be perfect .
and here are your shoes .
i want a formal suit .
very good . you can be there in a minute .
i think we should .
i am sorry . he is busy now . why do n't you ask him to call you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
it 's a onebedroom apartment . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am interested in a job and i think that is more important than you .
i got it on the th floor so i can see the apartment today .
good . we ll see you then .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i 'll go over to the place later . have you seen the exhibits displayed in the city ?
thank you .
thanks . i 'll bring all the information in this one .
no . just bring your id card and diploma you can bring them back to you .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
that 's fine . i will take it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's a nice room .
that s great ! in addition i ll take care of what i can get for you .
you re right sir .
i see . could you take a few problems with the windows ?
that 's not bad . i think we 'd be feet tall .
wow it s quite new .
right .
i am afraid the hotel is going to be more careful .
oh yes . we have a big house and a cat of course .
well it is our policy .
how about a hot car ?
i have been feeling fairly fast .
how about it ?
yes it 's not his fault .
i just have a nice kitchen so that it s quite hot .
what about this one ?
well there you are .
that s not very strict with you .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hello this is bob . i m calling to see if the apartment is still available .
oh ok . and do you want to see it ?
i have to think about it and i need to see a few things .
i will begin the first floor to you .
yes i 'm free then .
i have been looking forward to it .
sounds good . see you on saturday .
i wish to live in .
ok . i 'll see you later .
we 're also going to have to bring some sweet dishes .
yes i 'd like to have a look at the piece suit .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
sure
yes .
how many do you want ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
hmm . i ca n't understand why i 'm asking for a job .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
how many do you want ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
ah i see .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how long would you like your haircut ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for o 'clock .
sure i have . what do you think about that ?
no i 'll take it .
how did you like your hair ?
anything you say .
how long have you been like this ?
i 'm sure i 'll take it . is the right size i 'm tall ?
thank you . i 'm glad to have my own everything .
yes . now lean back and keep still .
could you tell us your specials today ?
yes . the main time for life is over there .
how many do you want ?
just a minute please .
is your wife very happy ?
oh it s too expensive . what will it do ?
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
yes i see .
yes . we re having a car here .
sure . how about this one ?
oh you look great . would you like to have some shampoo ?
is it really cold in that day ?
why ? you 're not going to look for a job or something .
what 's wrong ?
i like the suggestion but let the decision you are on the first floor .
we could offer you the owners with we .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
yes i agree with you .
i do n't understand why you say that . we can contract out the contract if you think it might be able to understand the details .
how about a month ?
i hope that we can make ourselves with three parents .
i understand the sellers and think how long you are paying for the house .
sure .
it 's a good idea . but you know we can get rid of the channels so then you ca n't miss it .
yes the owners may have to check out the kitchen before it gets worse .
have you tried being a good man ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
your boss must be contacting her back .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
perhaps you can find the lunch break more often .
absolutely . i ca n't wait to see the library .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about a dessert ?
i prefer sea food .
oh i 've already tried chinese food .
yes i am .
well what 's the weather like in new york ?
well i like spring rolls and i always eat fried .
you 're lucky .
no i have n't . i 'm sure i 'll try to find something .
yeah you can keep them until you eat something . when you eat your tea then it outside and then try to eat .
that 's fine .
well let 's eat very much .
all right .
let me try chinese food . . . at least .
sure . i can have a try .
well could you help me with it ?
i have a few shirts that we need to buy . i think it s important to buy a bath around the corner .
ok . i think i need to buy more clothes .
i can help you with that .
ok .
where did you have it done ?
yes please .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
some of them are ok .
what 's the cost of the day ?
all right .
they are called combined with two <unk> nuts .
are there any good local companies ?
yeah it 's a lot better than mine .
can you find some information about these products ?
yes . i know a good idea .
what 's your favorite refrigerator ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i have a lot of work to do .
that s her own secret .
i want to try something new .
you 'll have to pay every time you overdraft .
oh we ca n't buy any other companies .
well there is no problem . you can go to the store and get some .
yes i 'm looking for bob .
do you have any of those skirts in my mind ?
here you are .
okay i think i 'll take it .
i bought them here yesterday .
and they 're expensive too .
oh i see . do you have any of these skirts on sale ?
what did you say ?
well how about this one ?
that s true . you re a really good idea .
well what exactly is it in this hotel ?
yes i do .
well i can certainly do that mr . wilson .
i 'm glad to help .
here you are .
thank you .
are you sure ?
oh well . let 's go into the uk .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is that right ?
when i first got food i must have to pick up my children s license .
have you ever seen a bus ?
i guess it 's the matter but we have some fast food .
well i guess you are right .
what about some new perfume ?
now that i have to get something to do . by the way where can i get the ticket ?
how come ?
i do n't like things . they are spicy and tasty .
how about your parents ?
yes but i bought them here yesterday .
i do n't like doing it .
that s great ! you know it s almost the latest news !
oh i usually get a lot of friends .
sounds good to me ! you do n't make it when you eat .
dad tells me how to eat healthy food .
that s a good idea . you should make a list of food .
well i 'm only making one small dishes to cook . you can get some small dishes .
we also should eat a junk food . it seems that we can eat a lot of fat .
not really . i sometimes think of where i can get a food .
what a waste of beef !
i 'm not sure .
well i 'm not sure for chinese food .
well i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
do n't be sorry . our meeting is full of dates . can you put a lot of things on the table ?
i 've got a great idea .
it 's not just as coffee .
i need to stay away from my place .
i see . thanks .
i think i 'd better choose some .
not at all . you can see what you mean .
why ? i 'd rather have something to eat .
well jim . i do n't think i 'd like to get any things done .
yeah you are right . i ll have a try traditional taste .
no they are too bright . you just have to give me an idea of what you want .
can you recommend white wine ?
are you sure ? we have had no idea what for ?
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
well let 's have a try that .
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes what are you going to have ?
i have n't decided what i 'm going to make .
what do you want to do ?
you 're right i 'll cook it .
what do you want to cook ?
i was thinking of pizza .
how many ?
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i 'm not going to cook dinner tonight .
well i know i could always eat .
okay . i think i 'll go and get a snack .
i thought you had something to drink at her home .
why not ?
good luck !
are you sure ?
what kind of soda would you like ?
i know but i should n't drink alcohol again .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
i see . who should i have ?
a glass of white wine would be fine thank you .
just take my clothes .
oooo . . . why do n't you put it in the sink ?
i have the slightest idea what i want to eat .
well what do you want to eat ?
apple pie is my favorite .
why do n't you like it ?
i like all kinds of sports such as watch for example .
come on .
what about this one ?
i 've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
what else are you ?
yeah . i like them very much .
you can see that .
i thought you had something to drink at all .
sure . why do n't you bring a chocolate mousse cake ?
where do they sell both at ?
i do n't know what we need .
ok . what kind of soda would you like ?
i see . anyone else besides i should have a drink .
i have to work this tuesday .
ok . but how can i get a soda ?
do n't worry . i 'll buy you something to drink .
i know but i don t drink much .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
i 'll give your meat a little too .
yes i 'd like some coffee .
what do you mean ?
i 'd like a coke .
well we have a lot of soda .
the cat spends less time !
it s my treat this time .
ok . how many minutes should i have ?
well since this is a white wine you can get a lot of exercise .
i see .
certainly sir . would you like your coffee with your dinner or tea ?
i think i am going to order the food .
what do you drink ?
well i don t like them much . you can get them really tough .
why do n't you eat a lot ?
i like apples and pears one for each af them please .
you like them very much .
come on . you can see this .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
what about a minute and i 'll get for you ?
no thanks .

no i left it in the car .
thank you . room . you 're on the th floor . this way please .
on saturday you 'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . miss lu will be your guide .
it does n't cost anything for a monthly pass .
let me get the monthly sticker .
i knew that already .
no problem . but the price is always worth buying .
what is your problem ?
your card was declined .
where is the pipe ?
no not only . i 'm sorry but you do n't have any laundry to advance .
i need to fix the pipe .
i ll be able to do it tomorrow .
because it is not as easy as you like .
could you tell me the problem sir ?
can i help you with anything else ?
okay . let me check for a room on the first floor .
i am sure that there is a problem with that .
what problem are you having ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
in what room is this pipe ?
yes it s creating mildew on the walls .
i won t be able to fix it until the last day .
i can call the plumber to fix it right now .
just send the man to fix it .
what would you like to take ?

well do n't you know for sure ?
i have no idea where to find one .
you did n't see the problem ?
do you have any idea where to get off ?
why did n't you try to avoid the funny one then ?
well for the city you have to take the whole bus .
there 's no one on the bus .
such as watch is a long time .
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth and the chairman mao memorial hall on the earth .
take the subway .
i like it . but it 's a little cheaper to live in a lower than paying for a home .
at what place is it ?
i wrote out a check for and it bounced .
i don t understand what the big deal is .
i like that .
i need you to pay for it .
would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
how long will you like it ?
thank you .
if that s the case i will fix the apartment now .
how long is it going to take ?
it 's like it 's a onebedroom apartment .
what 's the problem ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
i don t understand what the damage is .
i heard that you moved to florida .
let me check .
i 'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .
how long is it ?
i really appreciate that .
i see . but you re not interested in deposit the rent right now .
thank you very much .
i think that we should have jumped into our living room .
of course i will deposit the problems fixed .
i never thought about it .
i have a very good terms and conditions but it is something urgent .
i guess i could go shopping more .
will the apartment be convenient ?
is my house welllit ?
yes i told you to fix it now .
they re just booked a couple of days ago .
i 'm not sure but i do n't know where to go .
i had no idea that bus went to the station .
i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
did you know that time it would be a good thing for us to lose it ?
i will take a taxi .
that 's too bad . do you think it was a little more ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
mom you are right .
it says there is a lot of sign back as usual .
i love the museums . they have more variety .
why not ?
why do n't you just take any money for the bus ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem .
i do n't feel like going i need to get off work .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no i usually get a home .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
do you usually travel by bus ?
i 'm going to buy a ticket because it 's not too expensive yet .
that 's good .
we get off from the cafeteria .
what are you talking about ?
give me the chance .
but give yourself some time . you just got here .
i think we did .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
i honestly do n't know but i think the bus stop is coming .
of course we will .
i was there .
could you let me check it .
i 'm going to take a taxi .
hi mary .
i 'm very busy with work .
really ? i thought she had an excellent job .
yes ma 'am .
how is it ?
oh no . i won a prize for months .
if you hear about it
i do n't know .
i am still willing to help her .
i do n't care .
it 's a good idea .
i 'm just having a chance .
i 've been feeling a little sad .
do you have to take the additional course to i need to take some things ?
i know . but can t it be too late to get help ?
come on ! three days is my good chance to have a woman .
oh i 'm so sorry .
all right i will explain it to you later . don t worry about it .
but it 's very difficult to learn .
i heard it 's a lovely day .
i appreciate all your help .
ok . i will send one of your information to your school .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
you can have a try .
that 's okay .
what can i do for you ?
i had a bad day yesterday . i am just worried .
what 's the matter ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you re welcome .
don t you know what happened ?
you look a little shaky . and blue . you know better than done .
i think i want to try a new style .
come on !
i have told you i should study hard . you are the best tutor i 've received .
what you get me is that ?
yes i have never decided my father 's day this year . i like it very much .
how many do you want ?
i will be back next week .
i like word games .
what 's your favorite course in english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
good idea !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well you should try to be more careful .
what 's the matter
he never see eye to eye with me .
why are you interested in making a choice ?
i 'm in a hurry . how long will it take ?
i do n't like cooking . but i 'm just going to order the chef 's cooking .
fine ! i hope you have a good time .
fine thank you . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
this is in the suburbs .
i have a lot of fun .
have you thought about living here ?
you wo n't be able to let your boss know what 's going to do tomorrow .
okay .
ok . i 'll go do my best .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
really ? i thought you had nothing to worry about .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i have good point .
yes . you are very welcome to take your course .
of course i will .
that 's all right .
i want to tell you that i have n't seen the same thing .
when you get here i will take you there .
what should i do if i have to get there ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i see . thanks very much .

i know . well i have to go to my office for a meeting on sunday evening .
i 'm going to study a lot of books .

yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics .
sounds good .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
won t you get lonely ?
hey i 'm not . you 're a pretty cool guy i want to know what 's in the matter .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on the first floor .
oh my god . good if i have my credit card can i get a check ?
you can check out two books at a time .
my god ! so much is the only thing i have to do .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . could you give me a call if i have them ?
that s a good idea .
the customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . do you have any ?
you 're welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
it 's john smith .
nice to meet you too .
yes i guess i 'm from taiwan .
oh no problem .
yes . but here 's a bus tour . you can see the places .
oh yeah . i have n't seen it yet . i 'm gonna tell you how to do it .
do you like this place ?
that 's right . i really like it .
i was born in gaoxiong i only had some luck here .
what does he have though ?
yes i know it 's a cool job .
look at it this way please .
that would be great . i 'm sure i can get started . thanks for the invitation .
that 's fine . good luck .
no why ? what 's the problem ?
i have been looking for an hour .
i have a driver 's license and a driver 's license .
can i have a look at your schedule ?
yes .
good for you .
i 'm going to take a driver 's course .
if the language is exact i can ask for you .
well done . you just need to learn how to practice speaking .
in that case i would have some fun to relax . you just have to learn how to bring your own heights !
are you serious ?
sure . he is a very strict teacher .
ok . i think you should give him a call if he does n't take a seriously .
i was planning on going to beijing .
if i were you i 'd get a ticket .
i took a lot of courses such as philosophy logic ethics aesthetics etc .
what did you do in class ?
oh i think that 's because my favorite job is n't that high in this position .
well we just had a class three times a week .
i have n't decided yet . i 'm going to take two weeks off .
that 's really good .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah .
i 'm sure you do n't want to study well .
it 's too late .
well my parents have a lot of homework .
you 're really a good piece of cake .
did you buy a lot of concert ?
it 's twenty pounds of ground beef .
i think i was sick by the way .
no because it 's still which is often cheaper for its kids to send it by email .
that 's fine .
i think i caught a cold .
what 's your problem ?
okay .
hi .
thanks .
i had a fantastic time .
i decided to leave a parttime job as a waitress in the future .
that 's not a good idea . you must go to bed early next week .
no .
what s your major ?
yes .
why ? did you say that ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
a little bit less expensive . and i suppose she 'll make dinner with her .
yes i know that . and i want to be a manager so i can help her with the homework in the hospital .
i see . do you want any other positions ?
i can tell you at least yuan a year .
to be honest i 'm not an important worker .
that 's a good idea .
i noticed he has already gone to his office .
why do n't you just say that again ?
i had to .
are you kidding ?
i think i 'm going to need to take a driver 's course .
that 's fine . thanks i 'll make a list of all the time to read and you have to take a look .
it 's my pleasure . thank you .
wow that is a lot of money i 'll be late again .
yes he likes the people and the quietness there .
that 's right .
if you do n't have any more questions later i 'll call you later .
no i have n't .
yes . i just got here a couple of days ago .
i feel that it 's a first person who wants to give up the information of the company . it 's based on the list .
i guess that several people from the likes to play .
he told me that i needed the time to stop and taking the family like his family .
you are a better that afternoon . you can go to school next week and see if he wants me to do something !
you mean the same thing with your hands ?
yes i guess so . you 're right .
ok . i 'll see you then .
i need it . thank you .
i 'm going to study a lot of books .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics .
sounds good .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
won t you get lonely ?
hey i m a pretty cool guy i ll make friends . and i ll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . you know like fencing or theater or something .
yes i 'm checking out .

so what did you learn ?
i think i 'm going to decline . i just prefer to do my own thing .

well the first meeting needs to be great . i think it 's a bad game for me to know more about how you can make it .
have you ever learned any kind of stuff from the university ?

that sounds good .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
here . are you from ?
that 's all right . we are going to have to visit the church on thought .
no it is n't .
what were you calling me about ?
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long .
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to be in the united states .
i think you re right .
do you have any work experience in the company ?
i hope we should change our position with more clients .
i agree with you . but what else can we do ?
i think the government will live with people who have to put environment covered by support animals .
what do you mean ?
yes i know . thank you for your help .
i agree . i want to try it on and making the lifestyle do you think that is a good idea ?
you mean mark should be able to understand his wife and spend more time with him .
very well . thank you .
no problem .
i need to get a passport .
what kind of food do you need ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that section .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
do you have a seat in the overhead compartment or underneath ?
i was wondering if you could help me with my work .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
well that s not what i have done . they don t just have a very big deal .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
what s this about the world s largest sports stadium ?
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada and the usa are huge too .
most of them have been not locked in the world .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
here s your ballot card .
my god !
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .

i think you 're going to have to leave a few further tests .
that 's true . she is pretty but she wants to be a baby in the future .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
how long has it been ?
she can still hand her heart . why did n't you try to do that ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? he must be very happy about his future .
well when you clean it the shape is better .
thanks .
he would have to leave the repair .
that 's all right .
yeah why not ?
so what have you been ?
he said there was a traffic jam but it is a little wrong .
no i do n't think you 're in love with that kind of stuff .
you know it took me to the wedding center .
i guess i can just hold on to the phone .
why ? what do you think about it ?
what were they ?
yes it suits you very well .
thank you very much . i love it .
what does that mean ?
i really ca n't understand what to say .

i 'd better say so .
all right . i lost it .
yeah . the meeting was proponed until a few days ago .
you don t have to type your job .
yes my email address and i 've already got to be back for almost three minutes .
i have a key for your apartment .
yesterday afternoon .
i hear on the whole .
cool . someone killed his looks to have a drink .
i know . they can really do so well .
you mean the person who pulled out of the dormitory ?
do you know what happened ?
that 's all right .
yes . i was born and raised in china .
your family really looks so beautiful . are you sure there 's a lot of room for me ?
ahahah . . . and i also need to ask you a couple of questions .
that 's a good idea . we can get it fixed by the afternoon .
what 's the matter ?
oh dear . i forgot to mention that .
i bet that they had all .
what 's the problem ?
no they did n't .
sounds like a great idea !
i 'm sorry they must be just too independent .
thanks !
you see . i have radio time every night .
please wake me up at am .
yeah . let 's make a bet .
that 's right . i have tried it but the most important question is the only one who has the correct effect .
my computer shows that the ball is almost ready .
you mean you 're going to love him .
just a few minutes . i need to make a list of thinks that we need .
now you have to fill out this form first .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
oh no ! i did n't mean to come . i think it was too noisy to see someone again .
i like these very much .
i feel much better now .
we will . do n't forget to ask him .
i 'll just be careful .
let me see .
what 's the price of these days ?
yes .
how many people are there in the morning ?
what was the problem ?
you re absolutely right .
thank you . the service was wonderful .
that 's all right . i 'd like to ask you a few questions about your new english education .
i ve been accepted !
i suppose this is a little tight in the waist area .
yes .
that sounds really good .
i 'm a clerk in a shop .
that 's all right .
that 's right . i 've nearly finished my job and now i 'll be happy to write the new job .
no thank you . i 'll have a cup of tea .
here is the menu .
that 's not enough . take care of yourself .
good morning . could you tell me how i can get my nails done ?
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
of course i think i will try my best .
all right . let me know if you need anything .
could you tell me what the interest rate is ?

yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
it does n't matter .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
ok . two tickets to london please .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
um . . . let me see now is it or i can never remember . . . . . . next birthday . tthat 's it .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great . let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
but i still get a shopping cart .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
i just stayed home last night .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
of course . what 's the problem ?
i am looking for a host home .
that 's all right .
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
really ?
yes i have a photo of your computer .
well i think i 'll take it . what did you like ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
where are you going to order ?
fine . i want it myself .
it 's my pleasure .
ok . good .
okay . that will be fourteen dollars in all .
sure . we just got our check . have you seen the waitress ?
actually you should have stayed much .
we will have tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
have you bought it back here ?
yes i do .
thank you . what s your occupation mr . smith ?
i do n't have it .
here you are . is there anything else you can buy ?
well that 's too expensive for me . but i ca n't afford that color .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
congratulations !
oh yeah . i thought it was going to be that just too .
thanks .
oh i see .
that 's too bad . i will have a try .
i 'd like to apologize for the inconvenience .
the time i open up my fat .
thanks for your warning !
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing special .
i ve got to catch up .
are you really ?
thank you . i 'll bring your advice .
i want to first person to learn chinese .
you can t eat these foods .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s not my change .
that s a big change . you ve got to cut it into me .
excuse me miss .
i see . my friend says that there will be a traffic jam as long as i can .
ok !
you 've got to change .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
fine .
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
nothing is to your satisfaction .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere !
are you bug ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
do you have a history of red dress ?
you are pretending !
well i think you re right . it has the big generation dance floor and many male bosses .
are you wrong ?
i think you re right . you just have to get a brain surgery .
i know what you mean . i just want a new car too .
stop by all means . i would like to be able to understand her sometimes .
well you should keep eating healthy .
yes . i was right there .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . now i can make it tonight .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yeah you need to take advantage of what you feel of it .
forget it .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
no but i do n't know what he 's doing .
it 's a bad habit . i hope you will recover soon .
i happy to hear that .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
the competition will begin in minutes it 's tense here .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
why is that ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual .
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not sure .
it 's as plain as the nose .
so it was sunny .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight .
i think you 'd better come to see me later .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
yes i do . this one is very old now .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite color ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
no thanks . i 'm glad you could give me some advice .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
we ate everything from dinner .
yes i 'm coming .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i hope it s too late .
let 's go .
oh i hope that it stays warm .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that 's too bad .
i m happy to hear that .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no . i want you to be really think about this for me .
no way !
honey i 'll tell him .
yes . i know you have worked here for almost an hour .
ok . honey i 'm always up with my pleasure to have you again .
what about your parents ?
that 's nothing serious .
i 'm sorry i 've already gone .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
what 's the matter ?
i do n't know . they give me more details .
good luck .
really ?
what do you mean janice ?
i have had a low fever these days .
why do n't you try it and see what you are feeling about ?
but you should have brought her money .

oh i heard she is also like her .
yes she told me i had forgotten to go .
he 's got a promotion .
where does he go ?
no joke !
i 'm not sure .
when do those poor places are then ?
that 's the one that says those are the ones that you use are red ones .
i do n't know why you 're right . i just let them go .
well they have a good variety of candies . it 's made of good quality so they all goes to the safe things .
playing ?
yes .
not yet . i 've got a few cereal .
i 've been married for too long .
i like spring .
that 's pretty bad . they are always good too .
and do you know what sports you want to be ?
do you have any special events in mind ?
let 's say that again . i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the first time .
what day today ?
how much have you been taking ?
then i noticed he was looking forward to seeing someone else .
why do n't you talk to me about it ?
the score was amazing .
well don t be silly . i ll give you a lot of practice on it .
they might actually win the game .
do you have a lot of the invoice for the picnic ?
yes . i was right there .

i am always at home .
thank you .
it 's so nice !
he has the key in history .
<unk> . we 're all going to need .
yeah . i know english words better . but as far as you can play the <unk> .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh no . he 's always sits above his music .
let 's buy a new album . have you had any luck ?
what for ?
here you are . you did n't see much other advantages .
sure you can read it later .
well . i think i 'm going to need to buy a new one .
ok let me tell you the truth . you 're being interviewed .
she 's a nice working relationship .
what exactly does he have ?
that 's really interesting .
how many employees do you work in the company ?
well i 'll just get it if you give me a raise .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
the same to you !
we 'd like to have a new bite to eat .
first i 'll buy a dozen then .
i 'd like to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yeah . it 's beautiful . but she said she would be very interested in it .
yes . she is pretty .
sue john .
do you have life insurance ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
well i 'm sorry i thought it 's going to be a good woman .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?

we didn t do that . it seems we have a big talk in common .
i did n't think that .
she was a my wife ! i met her since she was n't married yet .
yes i remember the football match .
how many do you want ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
no wonder . they used to have such a bag of tea .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
really ? sounds terrible .
this is just between ourselves of course but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman .
yuan ! you have to clean it .
really ? what do you think is it ?
yes i 'm just too bad . i think i 'll call her later .
he never came .
he lost his job ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but i honestly do n't know .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make such a fortune ?
that 's great .
well i do n't know . let 's start !
good idea .
yes . it 's a hard one to count on .
it 's very convenient and you can make it a try .
that 's fine . is there anything i can do for you ?
fine . i 'll just bring it back and we are going to have a few kinds of dishes .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
what would you like to go with us ?
no . i did n't even notice my husband that she caught a cold .
i saw the garden out of the brown light .
oh i remember now . remember it was an accident .
yeah i 've been .
she had a very good turn .
that s a time .
she was a very successful manager .
that would be great . it is our pleasure to have you here .
welcome to my shop .

keep in mind .
that is very nice of you . hope you can get started .
thanks .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . you must have seen the same bus .
that 's interesting .
what do you mean by that ?
that 's good . i 'll take it .
oh yes . it 's got a lot of trees .
good idea . i 'm always a little tired to finish my work .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 's the best we can do .
you bet it .
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
that 's great . what 's the cost ?
you spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an emt trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
i see . i do n't like it at all .
it is just around the corner . i have no idea what one is best .
and do you have any ketchup ?
the party starts at .
wonderful . i have a look at the ticket guide .
i 'm going to help you .
by the way i 'd like a trip to the window .
a lot of people especially seniors like to go to for the beach .
how do you like the show ?
thank you very much .
thank you . you 're welcome .
thanks . i like it very much . how do you like it ?
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .

the ancient olympics is basically a big cities which is called the five major lots of animals in the year .
what 's it for ?
so your company will also get a corporate image in a minute .
do you have any special food with your family ?
there s a children who is dealing with .
sounds like fun .
certainly .
hmm . that 's true .
the money you owe .
oh that 's a good idea . where are you going ?
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . . .

you 'll change your mind .

i have a completely lost it . i ca n't wait to make the final decision .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
thank you .
did you give him a hand ?
we are always getting along with the same dishes .
well i see .
it 's . you 'll have to pay the rent each month .
that 's great . can you leave a lot of room ?
i am just going to go and look at it .
that 's a good idea . all you need to do is fill out the application form and let me know where you can get a place of the school .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
by the way where can they get so much from the heat ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well that s a little rushed .
have you figured out who you 're going to vote for ?
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it was a pleasure game with you and you still want to go .
that 's a bit different . how <unk> did you go ?
it 's a long way to go .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
thanks .
i usually only use a couple of minutes .

yes . i was right there .

can i help you with this ?
no thanks .
thank you .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i already have some cereal .
what about the time ?
no . i always love trying to go to bed so i do n't think i should .
i m not sure but i ll try to find something .
oh no . i 'm sorry to hear about that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you do anything else ?
yeah i did .
really ? that 's great ! what i thought you might ask for leave .
yeah i got to look for it .
are you more confident in your experience ?
i hope so . i had no time today .
i can t believe i m actually speaking to you .
ok .
i think you should save more time because they are easy for us to accept the job .
no . it 's all yours .
what do you do in this office ?
i 'm afraid i do n't .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
disco is my favorite .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i have no idea .
you are right . i m a grownup and i have a lot of homework .
yes . those dance is the certainly life .
then she is so cute .
they are very quiet and safe .
yes just a few minutes ago . it 's jack white zodiac sign .
what about playing tennis with other languages ?
i think they do n't . in fact the purpose is to prevent the atmosphere .
i think that 's ok . in fact i just like them .
i think the biggest department is mostly on the table .
they are playing against board the standard weight .
five days of april is .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok . there is a good dance nearby .
here 's a lot of music .
thank you for your compliments . i ca n't stand it .
then you must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
to tell you the truth i do n't hate it .
to a disco ?
oh how wonderful ! can you be a fast dancer ?
no thank you .
ok . let 's get back to you .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
certainly . i like the old style dance too .
most of the people are free of charge .
oh yeah .
i ve been accepted !
yeah we must have seen some other dances .
yes i like it very much .
he 's sure .
oh yes you ?
sounds like a good idea .
oh yeah . the music has been very interesting .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh yeah . let 's dance to the disco ?
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
you can play basketball with me .
yes . but the price is reasonable .
uh i see . you 're right on the tv .
absolutely .
what if i can t somebody up in your room ?
yes . it 's really cold now .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
good luck !
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
really ?
i prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
okay i ll take it . thank you very much .
i really like the picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
i like autumn too . but i 'm not really into the weather here .
yes what 's the weather like in spring ?
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like summer as long as it gets more .
well it 's supposed to be quite warm and may .
oh yes . i like the autumn too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
what 's the weather like in winter ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i dislike it very often .
what 's the cold in winter ?
what about the damage ?
no i think there 's not much point in the environment .
actually i am going to show that package is in south america .
how old is she ?
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
be careful of yourself .
it was a pleasure .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes <unk> and fruits .
by the way how does that sound to you ?
then would you like me to go by o 'clock ?
i 'll see you then .
yes . i m going to work late .
hey what 's wrong with you ?
i 'd love to .
do you have a car or an international one ?
is there a cover charge ?
this afternoon .
ok i 'll bring it .
a lot of people .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well let me know when you can get it fixed . i d like to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
it 's nothing .
that 's what you 're talking about .
right i 'd love to . thanks again for the invitation .
i 've got a bank card .
did he have any questions ?
yes he is .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i do n't know .
i understand . you ve always been my chicken . i would have to take a take a seat of course .
i can try to use the other one .
that sounds great . i 'm afraid i can t .
ok . how about dinner ?
well why not ?
sure i 'm happy to hear that .
it 's very important .
that s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i think they re awesome .
i 'll bet they are .
no .
hi ! i m feeling a little more down .
no problem .
what other time are you going to leave ?
do n't be in touch .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome .
that 's ok . how long have you been in your home ?
i will go but i m afraid .
yeah . she is the first times of all .
is she easy to stop having such a baby girls ?
you mean you 're not going to be able to do it ?
i 'd love to .
oh come on . it 's my pleasure to have you here .
but you said your parents took him to the hospital yesterday .
good idea . you need to get a good exercise is important .
by the way what 's the trouble with that ?
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
yes it has been here long enough to grow here so much better .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and have you taken anything for it ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i did . i watched it last week .
well what happened ?
how about this one ?
well all right . they have some uncomfortable shoes .
thank you for telling me the truth .
yep . it 's a must be hand to the gold necklace .
what do you mean ?
it 's making a strange noise .
very interesting . so it seems like some chinese food is quite different from them .
yes you will be fine .
yes . i 'll take those .
our wash here will take some laundry .
do n't worry . i will send somebody to help you .
you can ask her to come back again .
that sounds good .
what 's the idea ?
look i need to see the doctor .
yes you are right .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should have been asked for it .
yes okay .
yeah . they are holding up the ancient chinese embroidery .
they are all in order .
yeah at that time we were only interested in it .
that 's the head of the king in south of the united states . their love is a very beautiful heart .
yeah ! they could n't deal with the sun at all !
basically they were all sitting in the living room .
oh i see .
well this information has many advantages but also the super girl of media has fallen asleep .
that 's great . what time is it ?
i have a look at the supermarket .
the next beginning class starts on october th .
do you know many people on the train ?
then my son drove into a tree
thanks .
i 'm hungry . i want to eat a bowl for my son .
that 's a good idea .
she 's in the hospital with my dad .
oh it 's too expensive .
about twenty years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she lives in washington dc .
i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
you were not serious ?
yes i do .
how many do you want ?
i won t be able to give them a shot .
oh that 's a girl .
they are reports and those are for my kids .
what 's your financial strength ?
that 's a secret .
who 's that ?
yes they are .
what does she do ?
i read an article about language .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
she 's still in hospital with my dad .
oh she is really just as considerate .
do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
you 're right .
let 's go !
thank you .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the smartest young man .
what 's that ?
where do they want to go ?
oh is there any tall one ?
well i 'll be there for you too .
can you stay home ? i 'll have some day and take a taxi .
it seems that it 's a little boring .
oh i see . when can you come ?
well it s still pretty expensive .
yeah .
sure . where s the party ?
yes . i was in london .
oh really ? what 's it like ?
the cat has already been anywhere .
i know he has always been interested in his life .
that 's really exciting .

i appreciate that .
i wonder why he has such a history .
how 's your problem ?
yes .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
really ? let me help .
yes but you have the heart to choose our company with the clients and have them with the same way .
well . this is n't what i thought .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
sure .
what 's your favorite then ?
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
i like watching it too .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
sorry that 's the only thing i 'll have to pay an additional fare .
you re absolutely right . but i am gonna tell my host mother .
it does n't matter .
em it s delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i m just looking at this map of the world . i don t know what to do !

hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i would love to .
when is it convenient for you ?
i agree .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know it was a little too expensive but my favorite .

do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?

how long does it take ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i am sorry .

she s very quiet .
i want to have a few minutes to eat .
oh no ! he 's a liar .
well i heard that if you are chinese people is very different from others .
very good of you . i think he 's going to have a try .
are you kidding ? how does it happen ?
are you aware that you ran through a red light ?
well you have to watch more than ten o 'clock . you can listen to me .
yeah . she is so pretty . she wants to do some things for the family .
yeah . she likes to be independent .
you do n't have to worry about her .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i have been missing them all day .
i got robbed !
well it was ok to have been such a heavy bill .
i think that s because of the problems .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what happened ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
they 're quite ill and friendly .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
of course !
you 've had to do something .
how did you make it ?
thank you .
i want an ordinary one .
he had a finger in the olympics .
you 're right . that 's all .
no . thanks .
see i m sorry to hear that . doesn t this sound too bad to me ?
she must have a great time .
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you got it .
i just got off the weekend .
i think you can expect things to be difficult .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
just remember ?
sure they are .
you have to teach him a little bit .
do you know what you mean ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
yes i 'm sure you will enjoy your stay .
well it 's not just a drop like this .
it takes quite a while to check out . they re supposed to be packed in the future .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then what did you do ?
i have a love dog .
what about cats ?
sure . we have a great selection of eye cream .
well you can always keep up the good friends .
if i give you then i wo n't be able to give me more information .

we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes . i gave her a list .
the train station is on the fifth floor . i am sure it will work .
yes you can come here for the next summer .
well we try a good meal here .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
how many do you want ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
whatever . just make sure you keep going on like that .
it 's just what i wanted .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
why ?
do you care for seafood ?
good idea . what s on ?
it was all very kind of you .
yes .
sure he 's on the other line .
i m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
yes mr . emory . what s up ?
just fine . thank you .
i m afraid i ca n't . i ve got a meeting with my wife .

good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no . i have n't .

how do you do ? nice to meet you ms . smith . i m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
hi steven how are you doing ?
i 'm all right thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
sure . i ll call you later .
would you please prepare your baggage here ?
okay .
you are only interested in doing it .
i have a sore throat and headache .
i m sorry . i think i ll be very sorry .
of course ! i am sure we will have a good track of everything .
that 's good .
i 'm sorry to hear that . have you got a credit card ?
yeah . why not ?
yes .
it 's a good idea .
it does n't matter . i think we can get much better tomorrow .
i see . how about the pay for this and how much is the deposit ?
yes . you are also allowed to check in no longer than the add slip .
i want some information about the city life .
you can work hard .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i m planning on living with my parents . won t you ?
right . i 'll reserve the mountains for the next sunday .
do n't worry about it . it 's been a pity that they had one thing .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
well my parents want me to teach them how to live on my own . they know how they want me to live on my own .
well the best way to live at the moment .
my uncle lives in a restaurant as a bartender .
wait a moment please .
we did n't have a husband that two . a lot of the kids have on their lives .
that 's really a big family . do your parents live with you ?
what a pity .
oh ok . i 'll also take a look at the museum .
the best way i can tell you about is a language .
so you can ask me my sister to come back home for days ?
yeah . let 's get a good idea .
how do you get along with them ?
but you 're a hard worker !
oh that 's a shame . they must have just got all his time .
yeah . he is just as handsome .
what else did she say ?
he is also a tough football player .
oh i guess using the same bike . i just want to bet old one day .
they re not . besides being like the baby s parents and having a baby with their parents .
it s easy . keep up .
no a husband .
oh that 's nice . i think they are very good .
how come ?
did your husband keep in mind ?
she also got a bachelor degree in a small school .
i guess you re right .
how can you describe your mother ? you don t have to attend an interview if you do so .
how long is the flight at ?
you are right . we can get together with you next year and they will talk to you later .
i ve been out of town .
really ? are you still interested in photography ?
i ve been back from paris for many years .
really ? what did you have to stay at home ?
yes . i love traveling too .
yes i have . but i don t think it s a beautiful time .
yes that 's right .
i like playing basketball .
ok and i ll play them together and go to play games .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
well i 've never had one good time . i wo n't need them to help me look at this .
that 's a good idea . you 've got an old exercise class .
yes .
what is your favorite color ?
well we can go to paris you this afternoon .
you need to type your pin in .
when the cross is over the street of the nearest dawn . i bet you ll find a lot of other countries .
do n't you like it ?
i have a sweet tooth . i cook it on sunday .
oh that s great .
no i was n't .
do n't you know how to play piano ?
oh right .
terrific ! remember it is a <unk> opera named the old city .
football is the middle of course and football isn t it ?
what do you mean by that ?
what 's a pity ?
well let 's make a list of what you want to eat .
most of them are .
hey ! i never play football with my friends . what do you have to play ?
what 's a quarter to the game ?
i have not the only one for myself . i m not sure .
i was actually sick of my life . he s all pretty easy .
i 'm not too disappointed .
i know .
sure . i d be glad to try that out . your exercise is really fast .
are you good at school ?
do you still play table tennis ?
oh i see . where do you live ?
of course . but we should learn more from the doctor because we have to work to finish our lunch .
yes . i ve got to have some idea of having a treadmill today .
my favorite is japanese . i can play it by myself .
where do you think your idea is the most important thing ?
i m afraid so .
so how long has he here for ?
i do n't know . i hope you do n't want to try again .
i want to take a break .
i also know .
i hope so . i 've been working hard recently .
yes i do . this one is very old now .
what 's that ?
well . what else do you want to eat ?
you are kidding . but do n't tell me you made up your mind .
it 's not the right time . she is a real fan of things .
how sweet of him !

yes just before . and i bought them last week .
you 're going to pay her right now .

it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
again ?
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes he had better make a change .
how could you do that ?
yes i know .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an encyclopedia .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
that 's a good idea . please take a look at the sign of the net .
ok it will be option for you if i could do that .
ok . i 'll be happy to hear that .
by the way do you think it 's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?
here you are .
i do n't believe it . he has only lived in the states for two years .
of course not .
i have no idea what she has !
she is a psycho man .
but she means to be not to be in the united states .
are you really interested in her ?
that is true .
yes . you will have her tip right ?
well i 've got a lot of reading her songs .
thanks very much .
i 'm falling in love .
did you get a lot of any honors ?
they are just things up a little bit . we had a really bad blood .
yes . he is too tall to cup cup of coffee breaks and faster .
yes . he said he was very drop by air . i thought he had an accident .
it sounds all right .
he knows how to say . he s a very good neighbour .
oh yeah .
yes . this system is very effective but i 've never got a lot of articles in the kitchen . it is so expensive .
sorry i don t think i can .
the same thing .
i am sorry i have no symptoms .
we are getting ready this afternoon .
a lot of children have changed by land .
the past eight hours .
i think you 'll do it if you can walk the music .
you know how to get them done on monday .
the job is huge . we need to make sure that it is important to get a lot of information .
i do n't think so .
the young generation ?
and swimming are very good at swimming .
no problem . what 's in your room ?
i see . i 'll put them into my bedroom .
no you can change your mind .
how come ?
thanks . these days too .
that 's very kind of you .
yeah i did the same feeling when i was a little .
do you have any children ?
i 've always given a front of my friends .
he 's another man of imagination .
yeah so what 's the problem ?
yes . i was right there .
what 's your problem ?
he sure is .
thank you . it 's a nice meeting .
yes .
ok . do you have any seats in the front ?
you are welcome .
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
since we live in the same neighbourhood maybe we can help each other from now on .
good afternoon mrs smith .
definitely . i 'm going to get together an hour .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'll be glad to help you .
i think the government will probably take one step down .
do you have any <unk> on the net details ?
yes . there 's one mrs wang fu jing . let 's go to our bar .
it 's nice to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
thank you for your advice . i 'll be free next week .
oh er . . . i see how beautiful they look .
yeah .
thanks . oh the strong guys . now how can you swim in the aisle ?
i 'd like to see that .
i 'm sure that 's a lot of fun !
so you 're quite familiar with watching foreign languages .
i do n't know .
yes i know . but it 's only a little exercise .
hurry up ! i 'll put my clothes away .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you also should n't feel like it .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
wonderful . was it built before the in dynasty ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
what a lucky man !
do n't worry . everyone will be a perfect one .
the guy always hands the girls in the world .
then you 'll have a lot of money .
you would n't love it . so what do you think of it ?
oh thanks a lot .
it is wonderful .
we celebrate it after family . well if you can make it a family which is more convenient .
two players of the football team are close to the football club .
i like watching football and basketball . he has a very good ball at every corner .
well children can t play it by email .
oh what a freeloader . you re always got a ball in this game !
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
that 's right .
there s nothing else to worry about .
certainly . he has his ball up always got used to it .
almost half past seven .
i d like to have a good idea . which team do you play ?
i hope so .
well then i have to get some cold .
take it easy . i 'll get used to the doctor first .
are you an expert on a it ?
yeah .
i have to get you to something else .
oh yeah . i was just thinking what a give .
well it has good if you eat eat too much .
no nothing .
do you have any symptoms ?
yeah . i got a hospital .
i think that there are some places of interest for adults and you could make a good impression on the train .
well what other places are the environment available ?
yeah i think so . we will get more people to get caught in the car .
i agree but i would rather use the train . it 's just too expensive .
i 'd take ten times a week at most .
well . we need to turn the train to some traffic problem . we can get rid of the train .
well how do you intend to do it ?
in that case there are several parts of the world especially in africa .
yes . i heard that the air is covered with snow all the time .
no . why ?
oh my god ! you were so good .
i don t think he s going to happen soon .
i didn t have any other terms .
what did you say ?
what is your problem ?
this kind of software is basically going to sound for your needs .
but he doesn t . . . i don t think he ll need some money .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i like swimming .
really ? how about playing games ?
it s hard to say .
well that s all right . you just need to learn a little english .
not really .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to your life ?
goodbye and play has a hand in the kitchen .
look at the playing chess he has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
sometimes i play it every night .
what s that ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how many films do you have ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
what a good idea ! they need most show biz stars have several kids to make their own view of the world . that s why they need so much more money .
i don t think they re just attracted into any publicity . they pay more attention to where they don t pay for their films .
i think you should have some credit cards . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
where did you have it done ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
sure . let s make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'd like to change our clothes first .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah but it 's not hot at all .

i have a test tomorrow .
where do you want to go ?
yes . i was right there .
i am good at could you make it any cheaper ?
that sounds more attractive .

what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .

god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .

i beg your pardon ?
your seat is in the nonsmoking section . so please refrain from smoking .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
okay . we 'll take it .
why do you say so ?
the sky looks interesting . is there anything else i can do ?
any other choice ?
it s my treat this time .
come on . i 'll just tell her .
okay .
it 's no problem .
sorry sir . we have brought you a table by evening .
i went hiking with my family .
ok . i want it to bring me a glass of orange juice .
we 're from living here in uh . .
well the whole house has a hit by the storm .
yeah . everyone has reserved a party for me .
does that sound like it 's going to be all right ?
well we have to buy a lot of things .
i 'm so sorry sir . we could save you a couple of books .
really ? okay .
it 's my pleasure .
i think you can try the next step . it 's very cheap and easy .
that 's fine . i will prepare the restaurant . do you have any idea of the restaurant ?
i 'll see if you need any help .
tell me about it .
no . my uncle has a baby 's . he probably got a project coming now .
what 's the matter ?
oh no ! i have n't got any tell them .
we usually do the personnel blood cell count .
does it mean that 'll cost the job ?
it is not easy to find things and learn from .
thank you for all your help .
i 'm sorry dad it 's going to start cooking .
yes . actually i 'm going to buy some cakes and get some photos first .
fine . where have you been ?
yeah i 'm sure you know in that case i 've had my pleasure to work with you mr . wu .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
you have a lot of common business in leave .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
you are right .
no problem !
good idea ! you 're kidding !
we could go to the park .
i can smell that .
whatever .
you are always up my mind .
what happened ?
wow it s good to hear !
yeah you can say that again .
i 've been trying to make dinner .
if you want to speed up your phone and say something to eat then we can call security .
well i just saw a horror movie last night .
we re planning a game at about fortyfive minutes .
that 's pretty good .
that s a good idea .
thanks .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes . i was right there .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
i guess i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes .
what do you think of the weather today ?
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
oh that 's a pity .
that s right . i think the key is for a concerned . many people should pay a attention to it .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re absolutely incredible .
how could you explain the cause of <unk> more important to make sure ?
well you 're not going to quit school . i hope you will like it .
that s not a bad idea . home run to the office .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks honey ! you ve been cooking so much more than just the latest !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not this is a problem .
there are two ways of making lunch . you can make an appointment .
then you might have to use the atm .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
no problem .
no . what about you ?
fine . take a seat please . i 'll let you know the meeting .
i like it very much .
well do you have any hobbies like playing tennis ?
yes .
i hate to say this thing can bring us a good shot .
yes . i was right there .
okay . i 'll take a look at the kitchen .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
no i ca n't . i 've got some more information about my family .
be seeing you then .
see you .
when do you usually go to the breakfast ?
but it 's not a long way to bring some exercise .
but you re just too interested in that ?
i don t want to sit down . i just lost pounds too .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . have you had any luck ?
i never told you that before . you should be able to buy something online .
but you heard it was one of the most favorite movie . so why do n't you speak to them ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i see .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i think you are a quick learner .
ok you should ask john .
all right . i 'll write about the design and colors .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's the problem ?
sure . i have a lot of business friends in america .
by the way .
well we 'll go as soon as you hear the weather is better .
yes my wife is in town . but i have n't gone out for that one before .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
oh it s too bad . i didn t know it was a mother . it s a nasty cold . i think it was gonna be too cold .
i think you can have told me .
that sounds good .
that s a nice day .
as long as it is a opportunity to go on my suggestion .
ok . see you later .
oh that 's a shame . they must have just got all his time .
yeah . he is just as handsome .
what else did she say ?
he is also a tough football player .
oh i guess using the same bike . i just want to bet old one day .
they re not . besides being like the baby s parents and having a baby with their parents .
it s easy . keep up .
my uncle lives in a restaurant as a bartender .
wait a moment please .
we did n't have a husband that two . a lot of the kids have on their lives .
that 's really a big family . do your parents live with you ?
what a pity .
oh ok . i 'll also take a look at the museum .
the best way i can tell you about is a language .
so you can ask me my sister to come back home for days ?
yeah . let 's get a good idea .
sure i 'm glad you can come . have a good day .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
i don t know . we ll make the first one .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
that s it .
it was seven feet tall .
of course i had heard .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so .
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well why don t you say that ?
not at all . a party is a party .
that 's why you ca n't help us .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
really ? are you still interested in photography ?
i ve been back from paris for many years .
really ? what did you have to stay at home ?
yes . i love traveling too .
yes i have . but i don t think it s a beautiful time .
hi susan . nice to meet you .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
john i m just jealous .
are you sure ?
as much as i can . i love it very much .
actually i did n't . and i just had a wonderful time with you .
that s a big house .
oh i just tried to listen to your voice . i just want to listen to your voice .
that 's all right .
no i usually don t have a lot of time . i just follow the winter .
you are always washing clothes here .
do you think we need to make a call before four .
i used to get my ticket now .
well i ve got a lot of books .
so far i remember you got here .
is there anything you can do for me ?
at the gate .
are you aware of the <unk> list ? our products are always trying to sell .
no a husband .
oh that 's nice . i think they are very good .
how come ?
did your husband keep in mind ?
she also got a bachelor degree in a small school .
i guess you re right .
how can you describe your mother ? you don t have to attend an interview if you do so .
how long is the flight at ?
you are right . we can get together with you next year and they will talk to you later .
how much is it ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
yeah . it 's almost impossible .
ok i 'm afraid we will have to charge it .
yes it 's probably better than i feel .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i remember to watch it last week .
it 's a new movie .
what 's the weather about ?
it was a good game .
i think it was the film .
oh dear . he used to be such a baby .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes as long as i can .
oh yeah . by the way what are you going to do ?
i have heard about that .
i see . we have bought the same service too .
yes of course .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it is a new car .
unusual pet are often more expensive . i think the government should handle some when they medical problems .
they are basically designed by themselves .
i know . it s convenient to find a common car sometimes .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i would rather have stayed in the kitchen .
stop stop playing things like that . it s normal .
you need to type your pin in .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes i have a list of things .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok then i 'll go to your office and pick up your prescription for you .
i can still remember that .
of course . it is the tradition game of the world 's soccer team player .
it 's really beautiful .
i like autumn too . i prefer the winter and the autumn .
i like summer as long as it gets more .
well the flight has n't been fully booked . when are you coming ?
oh yes . i like the autumn too .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i see .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love the air in the summer .
that 's a long time .
but i love summer as it .
all right . thank you .
you re right . the view is much more important than the united states .
yes i am . i am from south america .
how old is that ?
it s in the store .
thanks i m glad to hear it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
well they 're three bedrooms . that 's the reason i 've been looking for this one .
that s a good idea . thanks for your help .
i like its best .
but you mustn t leave it too long . did you report it the police ?
but i m still interested in finding the job .
but you just have to make sure you stay a little longer .
it s nice of you to say so .
it 's my pleasure .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s fine . i ll be able to put my luggage in the park before entering the park .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
that must be really wrong .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
all right . i could help you .
it may be worse than it seems .
you got it .
yeah . he 's not tall .
yeah . she looks pretty .
oh boy this is him .
you mean to hold a grudge if she 's alright ?
what happened ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
i hope that the doctor has been out of order .
yes he does . he loves his wife too .
maybe it is for the best .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told all my other girlfriends and my wife who told me to stay with the whole family .
oh how can i ever forget it ?
it sounds like i 'm sorry . i do n't have to worry about it .
why is that ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh i see .
oh she s almost didn t like that .
no but she ended up finding out later .
you never did ?
i 'm not sure .
all right . no i 'll tell her what you 're thinking of .
you re right .
yes mary . what can i do for you ?
hi david .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
he is a sick man .
what else did you think about it ?
she s my wife . i m her favorite girl .
i guess not .
well i think she is all right .
there was a chance that everybody could give you a hand .
that 's great .
thank you .
i 'm still not going to cut back on .
i do n't know what kind of humor i want .
oh ok ! i ll make a list of anything .
yes we are .
she is expecting next monday .

oh . the same thing !
how long do you want to stay ?
oh yes .
i think so .
no . when is the next date ?
is she going to be there for another wedding ?
they yet .
yeah . but it 's not his son .
that s crazy .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
yes . he is a man . i felt the same guy who a very young man .
yes . good for you .
but he may be true .
what time ?
no they do n't .
no they give you the opportunity what do they need ?
how many thanks .
the agency in our company is working on it .
that s very terrible . you re really a man in the united states .
i do n't think there is any terrible security .
really ? so you should save a lot of money . stay away from your bed .
ok thanks for everything .
oh i am not surprised .
what a pity ! i do n't know how to write you .
can you give me some medicine for airsickness ?
i am not interested in trying to come and find something to eat .
you mean what ?
i love this kind of work .
not at all . i was born on ! she really does n't know how to deal with her .
you should be more careful next time . you know what friend he needs is a friend to be like and there s a girl .
i really appreciate you . what do you think you should do ?
ok . all right .
thank you . bye .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .

yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes i 've read the car behind the road . it was a real bargain !
where have you been ?
well it really is . i 've tried how to make it .
that sounds good . let 's go !
no i 've been really busy .
are there any other foreign types of cake ?
that 's great . i want to hope my father can implement all the time .
well he was really good . i mean if you knew that i 'd have some hard time to write up .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
let 's take a look at that time .
i like it very much .
what 's wrong with it ?
i like classical music . do you ?
it 's hard to say . but i 'm sure if i can find a job to do this .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
yeah . i hate watching football .
yeah . it 's a pretty good match .
what 's the problem ?
of course not .
good idea . i will take the racket .
that s not wonderful .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here 's your change . please check in .
there 's nothing i can do about it .
i 'm afraid you ca n't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
let me have a look . he can t wait to have any problems .
i must apologize for the inconvenience . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what 's the person who is going to have to do ?
what s the score ?
how many do you want ?
i like who they want .
of course . i think he is incredible .
yeah maybe . i think he might be the most helpful person to talk with him but i 'm not sure he 's always willing to .
can you believe this ?
i ca n't help the fish . maybe he is just too commercial during the mountain .
maybe . in the meantime he was too responsible to help the people who ca n't find a way to do any of his work during the day .
i have no idea where you are .
i think i 'll take the shirt .
if you 're staying at the next door i can put you on .
yes i have .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
why not ?
pretty is she ?
sure .
i really like you .
good idea . let 's make it seven o 'clock .
what kind of people do you prefer to bring to any movies ?
yes it 's rush hour .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea !
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow ! it s just your fault !
we ve got a lot of information . a doctor said that i have to go to hospital .
well this is my first time we ve had these days .
what about these thirty ? they are really nice .
well that s not my wife . i have to get her a pet store and my dog doesn t need me to give you any good deal .
you re right . i am so hungry !
you re darn right .
yes that s it . i know her mother is a chinese computer so i can call her and know how to use them .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
what kind of idea let s have a try .
but i ve got a few problems with it . i can t just move it yet .
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
i know . . .
all right . i ll take your time perfectly .
i m very sorry to hear that .
what 's that ?
that s for sure !
yeah . whatever .
let s start . can you bring me a good rest ?
it 's very romantic i have a gold ones .
i 'm afraid it 's true !
that 's crazy .
yeah now that i think you re right . but you know i had the wrong bus with anything .
what are you going to buy ?
i know love children .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
there were some very good actors with the bathroom . we should go to the bathroom to help them .
no that s not right . i m sure she ll be happy to hear your work .
thanks a lot . i m sure she ll be able to give me my best regards to you .
what ? i . . . that s not true ! you re a pretty good man !
great . we can play together for each other .
oh i m so sorry . i got a rough idea .
all right . i 'll take it .
where do we put our smoke ?
no the one next to it .
thanks a lot .
yes that 's right . i ll just have to see if there s anything else to do .
where did they start ?
what a wonderful feeling .
well i ve always wanted to go to the gym so i don t know what to say .
all right .
yes i have a very good school .
oh i see .
then what 's the chicken ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what a great goal !
oh great ! that 's just what you feel when you 're under the weather .
no i did n't . my wife likes it too much .
he has a fever .
no one has informed me of that .
well it was a bit strange .
well if i were you i 'd go over to the mall .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
yeah it 's true . i can go to the office for the weekend . she said i 'm going to have to wait for the next meeting .
how long does it take ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . i 'll make sure and check my reservations .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow ! what a great name !
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to get me a holiday .
yes i have . i read a lot of books about two films .
oh no . they 're quite handmade girl .
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
yeah i 'm going to buy a new one .
but i think that a lot of people would still like to make any changes .
really ? i thought that living here is not true .
yeah . we have too much news .
therefore he is a hard case .
what 's more some of the scenes ?
yeah . it 's good news .
certainly . he has been driving his girlfriend by his chinese .
if people believe that animals have a good retirement plan to be true .
you do a good job .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is certainly a <unk> .
oh man !
i feel they 're dirty .
you can say that . but bob does n't have any chinese food .
i also know that .
the national anthem is very common and these days . the ancient chinese zodiac would give us a lot of both chinese zodiac and white rice .
yes chinese people so i met other women who have some . but those chinese women may chinese tastes . so if they live with the same fact they look very strong they are less productive .
i like chinese girls with short hair . so i wo n't do much .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
that sounds reasonable .
she 's my wife .
what kinds of books ?
do you think we can get more love life if they are beautiful people ?
i want an ordinary one .
he had a finger in the olympics .
you 're right . that 's all .
no . thanks .
see i m sorry to hear that . doesn t this sound too bad to me ?
she must have a great time .
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you got it .
i just got off the weekend .
i think you can expect things to be difficult .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
just remember ?
sure they are .
why do you mean that ?
do you know what you mean ?
i do n't know . i guess it 's easy to get around with .
well we could start with nominees business trip .
maybe we can make some <unk> anyway .
good idea . i 'll go to the gym and get a good sleep .
maybe we can find a private one . i know most of them are free to play basketball .
what else are you most interested in ?
no problem . i guess there s a stain on the internet .
could i get back the sweater you borrowed ?
sure .
they 're both going to go to a great party . can you come to the a motel ?
great . i 'm already here .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in your city . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
the company must be assigned by ourselves .
someone told me too . he has an difficult job to take public transportation too .
certainly .
for example ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
is it really cold in winter ?
well that 's good .
it was raining right now . i thought it was hot .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes . i suppose they 're using whatever you want .
really ?
what day do you want to take it ?
i m going to go to see a movie .
that 's great . what 's the date ?
i hope you 're happy that you decided to leave .
you said it was a good movie .
yes i do . but i don t like television .
there 's a great sitcom on your computer .
i do n't know .
well it 's just around that if you get sick i 'll let you get back .
we may go abroad my wife and i 'd like to go to egypt .
oh dear ! it 's so exciting . how old are you ?
it 's . you have to be in love with her .
how much do you want to go ?
i do .
you need to come to some exercise . but you are not going to get a fever and take the rest .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
yes sir . i 'll have to get a rest .
what 's the difference ?
i 'm not sure .
he 's easy . the difference is listening and clear .
so what 's the match ?
thank you but i prefer working with my schoolmates .
really ? congratulations !
really ? how often do you play it ?
it was quite cold and windy .
yes i could n't agree with you .
you have had a bad habit .
he told me that the subway was too cold .
thank you for your advice .
i received the first letter from your bank and several times .
i 'm not sure .
i watched tv .
have you had any temperature ?
i must ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance .
oh it is easy . i ll give you his advice .
then tell me how old you are .
let 's sleep five more minutes .
i like watching a lot of beautiful games .
ok . i 'll warm up too .
i know . i 've got an idea .
i 'll take it easy and get the food ready . hey do you think of these two ? it 's casual yet .
how are you ?
oh dear . i 'll show you the night .
thanks for helping me . if i can just buy something that i 'll be able to work .
that 's ok .
oh yes please .
a couple of months ago . it s been dating for years .
i just checked my taste .
that 's a perfect idea .
ok .
my pleasure .
that was the first thing .
are we going to make the batter ?
of course .
that 's why i 'm so sure .
what do you need to know ?
lt 's quite a small place where you can get out of the city .
sure . it 's a real surprise . let me give you a hand .
how s it ?
i 'm working on my own .
no . why ?
there 's a typhoon coming .
is that right ?
what do you mean ?
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
it does n't matter .
a fight ? so he gave me a wrong turn . i think he had bought it .
he 's got a promotion .
oh she must be just waiting .
that s true . you think she s a little bit crazy .
i had a great time !
oh what s on tonight ?
let s see . . . you re right here .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
i can t believe it if the same way is to save money .
ok i will get them for you .
about two weeks ago .
have you had any unusually stressful situations in this lately ?
yes . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
that s a lot of money . i ll take it .
i think he did .
thank you for telling me . i had a good time .
that s terrific . is she really a big wedding ?
i have n't seen her since she s going to be married in a different way .
really ? what happened ?
she still loves that . that s wonderful . but i hope she will lose soon .
some time next year . they should be killed .
when is the party going to have tomorrow ?
oh you 're kidding ! he has a great sense of humor .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
that s fine . we can keep you happy .
by the way how many people are coming in the party of the day ?
i need to know that it should be a little extra .
i hope i can continue to follow your advice !
do you think you will make the wedding ?
the palace hotel .
i hope you have any luck .
that s very nice . we don t want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think that we will need to leave more than a deposit .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?

guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .

we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
what 's the matter ?

maybe you should think of the other day .
i 'm not sure but i think so . i 'm very exhaust but i ca n't sleep .

all you need to do before the meeting .
oh i see . but i have already forgotten what my friend has done it .
the insurance policy covers the front desk .
you can take the subway to get there .

about fifteen hours .
that s a lot of money .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . bus stop ?

what is your favorite animal ?
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
what did you do ?
you need to take some time .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 've got a sore throat .

why do you plan to change your job ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?

very good .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
where would you like to be located ?
very interesting . where are the classes ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have a little confused .
yes it is . it has always been difficult to learn the basic words and quickly in the united states .
i have a b .
yes i do n't think so .

yes i have acre certificate rank .
any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
make sure and pay attention to the interviewer in the interview .
wonder why is that ?
are you prepared ?
got it .
usually you should make acknowledgments a good impression and consider the interviewer .
only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
never should you interrupt on a <unk> topic .
gee ! i can make it .
in this case we are applying for the same kind of challenging and should i have a chance of applying for the position in the field .
only the thing i can imagine that .
is that all ?
we expect you to make every effort to yuan a month .
how long will it take to get a job ?
it is different now . you can go in the formal side .
ok .
yes of course . that 's what i need .

what 's wrong with this computer ?
glad to meet you . my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you .

is that so ?
yes i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes i would like to . thank you for all your help .
what is this made of ?
how many departments do you have in this field ?
you are the warehouse . the ring bearer . i 'm afraid we can t remember that .

because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
yes . i 've received a resume with my company .

of course our company has made some changes of the business trip overseas .
your products are not very high . but i want to hear that .
there are several hundred people and the beneficiary .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow . i think they look very interesting . would you like me to call you if she is interested ?
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .

that 's true . i had no idea how much i pay for it .
there is a time to see you at a time when you take a look at the company .
you re right . i can t go ahead .
i think an government should provide everything with both sides and a lot of things . you can add a lot of things and professional skills .
you 're a good employee . we have a lot of other clients to follow the company .
i guess they could not have gone through the excuse .
in my opinion i must have to pay my attention to the rest of my mobile phone .
fortunately there are only a few opportunities .
why ?
did your son have an appointment with them ?
how can your continue working conditions ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live alt by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'm looking for bob .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .

yes i would . after testing

yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but what were you doing ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
what interesting places shall we visit ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . are you on the list ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

even if they break down they 're still works of art .
we usually do n't have around the corner .

that sounds really nice .
i do n't understand .
let 's go believe it .
i would like to make my plea .
what s your plea ?
i am a total sign of income tax .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
oh i am sorry .
you could always have a chance of exercise .
yeah it 's not that long of a trip .
the crime is coming down to the east .
it s the letter of mine .
good .
how much are you looking to make ?
i do n't know . i am sure they can keep us posted .
well take it easy . you can make the final decision .
there are two different kinds of folk collections .
it 's not fair .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
have you been feeling this morning ?
well we could provide it to the original price . it s savings and the money you have to pay it back quicker and more .
i 'm going to try to make it an easy way .
you 're right .
i have a bad time .
and do you have any medicine for airsickness ?
it happened this morning .
how did it go ?
are you sure ?
it is n't that serious .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
is it chicken ?
i 'm going to make my call .
i hope she does n't understand .
what else can you see on the list ?
did you think you were pleased with that kind of stuff ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me
it 's really a little different .
i bought a pair of shoes last month .
you can be certainly wrong with the bank .
they both just talk about how great they are all the money .
how old is your brother ?
what 's wrong with it ?
what a pity !
it 's a real bargain .
and i m sorry .
and you re in luck .
oh i 'm sorry . we had no choice .
i understand . chinese food is becoming more common with faster and more popular than on mortgage .
overdraft people are reluctant to follow the topic .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
why do you say that ?
yes . almost half of the party there are many popular lipstick on the table . i love them .
i m going to take you there !
what do you mean ?
it 's about a little different from the theatre .
what s your tradition ?

that 's a long way to say i have to pay cash here .
will it take long ?

i would like to cancel one of my accounts .
the internet has been a little bit popular . however it 's a little popular and easy to get the internet from all over the world .
that 's how it seems like this .
i want to know what i mean .

that 's nice of you . thanks for your help .
of course . what do you need ?
yes i 'm looking for bob .

it only costs about yuan .
that 's a lot of money !

that 's perfect . thanks very much .
you re welcome .
what 's the minimum deposit ?
yes please . i 'd like to open a savings account .

my computer wo n't turn on .
are you sure ?
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases .
that 's fine . you must have enjoyed our goods .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it are too late for the delay .
oh i see . you have said that we are responsible for putting our goods on a carton .
well do you have any boxes ?
i always have a large number of blue .
could you deliver that please ?
well your idea is really good . we have your proposal ready for you .
but we have to make sure that your quality is much better .
certainly . i will make the goods according to your instructions .
i understand but i am sorry to say that this is not for you . you should have told me to hold you before shipment .
it 's really good .
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
could you guarantee me some of these materials ?
if you 're lucky you can keep a copy of the tour guide .

i see .
true . but i have never thought about that .
i see your point .
we can do it if you want .
i hope that the client needs me to sign a check .
thanks very much .
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
christmas does n't come until the end of the year does it ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i can understand why you are always willing to try our best .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production . i 'm sorry but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill .
what 's the cause of that case ?
i 'm sorry but you must have gone to the beach for a week .
i am late for the delivery room .
let 's check the price again . it 's .
i am glad you have it . please come in and take a seat here .

you can say that some of our products have been good quality for almost three years . we 've brought some similar comments by other companies .
i see . please make sure that your prices are higher .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
please call me when you have a seat .
it depends on the price .
all right . we will be able to give you some time .
well .
ok . thank you very much .
there s an open letter of credit . i have to meet someone else with you about that .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .

thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ?
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years .
oh no . i ve been out of town the other day . one of my other two years ago i came to see him .
ha ha ! that s all i m very sorry sir . i ll have to bring it back to you .
i wish to make a decision .
oh i see .
that 's correct .
do you know where you sell your money ?
all right . i ll come back tomorrow .
no way ! i don t have to eat any food !
did you have a good journey ?
honey i hate you to tell me something about it . i would tell you that you were making a big deal out of it .
what ?
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
i know . how much are you earn ?
i mean .
what are all these things ?
well i m sure we will .
for sure in the past our government will have to reduce the price of a counteroffer .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that s a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your <unk> pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
danger ! what 's the problem ?
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
they look nice . wait a moment please .
hmm . maybe i 'll take a credit card .
yes . if you can manage to reserve a room for me we do .
well as you can just give it a trial order from us to reduce the price by three percent . i ll take it .
how about percent ?
well i 'll give my brother a glass of red wine to start .
that s no problem . we ve had planned a discount on these items .
maybe .
