what do you think about it ?
here is the money .
it 's all right .
as a matter of fact we have agreed to go ahead .

i 'll have to think about it .
she asked me about twentyfive thousand dollars .

is that so ? i 'm sure you can do better than others . . .
but i do n't think it is possible to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin .
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
that 's all right .
i hope so .
no . he is still playing football .
and do you have any other questions ?
it 's definitely a doctor .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .

yes .
that 's weird !

i do n't care .
yes i will get it . i told you if i will stay here tomorrow .
ok .
who is calling ?
sure .
ok . bye .
yuan .
here you are .
i 'm sorry . we do n't have any skirt in size l c .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the saucepan the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes . go straight down this road and turn right .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . it 's on the third floor .
thank you .
take your time .
thank you .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
then what should i do now ?
you 're welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
i remember i 've been there in minutes .
are you sure ?
calm down .
yeah . it 's true .
so what did they have ?
how long will it take us to get there ?
don t mention it .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from us .
why ?
they are my mom .
i do n't know . why did you ask that ?
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's great . give me the landscape of the triumphal for the background .
maybe some of them .
what 's the difference ?
they 're incredibly selfish . they re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
can i help you ?
may i suggest a limo ? it 's nice to pamper yourself .
all right . have a nice trip .
we have lots of fresh orange juice .
i 'm not sure i 'll be there in twenty minutes .
do you have your passport with you ?
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster .
take care of yourself .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i ll only go if we can stop at the officelicense to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we ll do that on the way home so we don t have to carry it the whole time .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let 's go then !
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .

yes ?
the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
why not ?
ca n't you see the notes there ? it says no smoking here .
i 'm sorry .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i can t bear it .
i ve been accepted !
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
yes i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on a diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
um i do n't know what you mean .
ok .
ok i ll send it to you as soon as i get home .
rice .
here you are .
okay . anything else ?
sure mom .
i thought you 'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i 'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do is to get on the train tonight at pm .
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's right .
ah that 's right .
what s the rate ?
this job is still available .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you are not really chubby .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
his house must be worth millions ! that is one of the most beautiful areas in oxford . the surrounding area is really peaceful and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . how can he afford that place ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
are you in a hurry ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's rush hour .
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
do i have a boarding pass ?
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
must i catch a number bus to get there ?
no you need n't . a number bus will also take you to the hospital .
number buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you henry . i 'll get a number .
but number buses leave from the center of town . you 'll have to walk two miles to catch one .

yes . why ?
can you repeat all that ? i think i 'd better write it down .
what ?
how do i get there ?
take the no . bus .
thank you .
yes . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left there and it 's the first turning on the right .
straight ahead to the traffic lights left and then right .
that 's it . it 'll take you about five minutes .
thank you very much .
no nobody .
you don t mind if i smoke do you ?
well to be frank yes i do .
oh i m sorry . but this isn t a nosmoker isn t it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ?

what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .

there s no catch ! you just choose a plan sign a threeyear contract and that s it ! actually we re running a special promotion right now and we re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .

well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .

what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
we bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to get rid of the cockroaches .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no problem at all . the goods are for you .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got strappy sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes <unk> .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an <unk> shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a closedtoe shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want <unk> . i find slingbacks very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
what size do you want ?
size five .
here we are . how does it fit ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my insoles . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they used to .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some <unk> and we ll take it from there .
yay !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there . oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then <unk> pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a <unk> .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !
i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
wow that would be kind of useful do you have any other cooking magazines ?
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication but each issue has over color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
wow this is nice ! ok sign me up for both publications .
you mentioned you have a dog most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care pet shops and even pet sitters !
that is exactly what i needed ! what else do you have ?
well i also have . . .
well i like my boyfriend . i m really sorry .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
that 's a great idea .
what makes you say that ?
sounds good . thanks a lot .
very well . and you ?
may i help you with something ?
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .
i m happy to hear that .
i ll do it right now .

i see .
will you be paying with cash or check ?
that 's good .
what time ?
thank you .
i m fine . thank you .
what can i do for you ?
i need to cancel an account .
i will be at the apartment today .
i appreciate that .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
oh i see . thanks for your help .
how does friday sound ?
yes i think so .
no i ca n't . i am too busy .
i 'm afraid we have to go .
what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in it ?
it would be a camera .
why ?
i 'll be expecting you .
that 's all right .
where are you planning to go ?
no .
i see . should i bring anything with me ?
no but do n't forget to bring enough money .
i would like to check something out .
what is the rent each month ?
not really .
yes i liked it .
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away !
how much does it cost ?
ok . i will take care of it .
look i am playing the piano for you .
yes the bathtub is a bit too high .
you must have found an apartment .
don t worry . i ll get it myself .
i like it but there is one problem .
well thank you very much .
i checked some of the problems .
what is the problem ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
how much does it cost ?
very good . i will take care of it .
where s your polling place ?
well we have a lot of things here .
i understand .
thanks a lot .
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
would you like anything to drink ?
i would like to deposit some money .
no problem .
what do you mean by us ?
it will be summer .
i ll make one .
for what time ?
that would be great .
great . what time would you like to meet ?
ok we 'll be expecting you at . see you then .
yes but i like it very much .
i 'm happy to hear that .
just get over here !
what is it ?
i reserved a nonsmoking room but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that i can t endure it .
how much is it ?
your new apartment is so clean right ?
you should check the connections .
that 'll be fine .
you must have found an apartment .
yes it is .
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the rent is per month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what do you mean ?
sorry i do n't mind . i think it 's difficult to get .
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
then let s go and ask .
how much more ?
well i 've got one here . it 's a month .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at .
i had a home inspection before .
i received a lot of things from them .
can you call the home inspector ?
the bathroom plumbing seems ok too .
the owners might not be aware of everything .
i can t afford it .
i ll call the owners right now .
that 's a good idea . what 's the price ?
i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the secondfloor joist .
maybe it would be open on the fourth floor .
yeah that will be fine .
usually as long as you can moving the car from the end of the road .
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
alright . i ca n't wait to fill out this form .
i think it will be a good idea . and it also makes me feel so hot .
that will be fine .
and i need to think about it .
i have a yoga class on tuesday night .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i sent in an absentee ballot .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the driveway .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no <unk> this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
i 'm sorry sir this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
that 's not a problem .
i really feel bad about it .
thank you ! this is a wonderful hotel .
wow ! you 're lucky !
look i need to get up .
that 's because you cheated .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend .
so how much did you want to spend ?
do you like such dangerous sports ?
there 's a lot to see people here .
what about your family ?
ok . teach me how to play the game .
oh no ! i 'm so surprised . so what do you want to move around ?
no i 'm not really hungry .
ok . can we go somewhere nearby ? i do n't feel like walking too far .
do you know where dawanglu is ?
oh i forgot about it . i 'll get it .
well my god is n't it ?
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of seafood in it . they all look very fresh and delicious .
thanks a lot .
what ?
it 's on the fourth floor .
i guess we can eat there then .
it certainly was . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to try again .
because we 're partners .
what 's so great about it ?
what do you mean ? it 's a scrim .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i <unk> it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a good idea . thanks .
it takes about minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
no .
ok . you have stayed for four nights at us dollars each and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . that makes a total of us dollars .
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
yes i am james mason from anderson and associates limited . i would like to see mr . smith .
what kind of shoes do you want ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
personally i quite like the new perfume from clinique . it 's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would <unk> whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful thanks .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long . i 'm starving !
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or <unk> ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that 's nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
how about that one ?
i want a haircut .
let 's take a look at it for a general price .
what about that one over there ?
that 's right . we 'll see you then .
yeah . but it 's much better than a bus .
oh yes . it is very beautiful .
i m not sure . i feel terrible .
what will you do if you like them ?
i like the collar . i 'm not sure .
here 's the ninedragon screen .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
that 's right . let 's change it .
well indian cuisine actually doesn t serve beef .
i want some chocolate .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
yeah it s right time ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !
why do n't you go and look for them ?
i do n't know .
can i get you something to drink ?
yeah it s right time ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it s really not healthy !

that one truly is a beautiful piece of work is n't it ?

i guess i was asking for too much .
if it breaks down maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
i would like to buy a new fridge .

i was looking at this kenmore refrigerator .
ah yes that is a great refrigerator .
what 's so great about it ?

oh yeah i agree .
well it depends . do you want to send it via priority express or standard mail ?
how about going to work with me ?

i think so too . i do n't like him either . well who do you like best ?
she speaks very clearly .
i have a good ability .
she 's in the hospital with my dad .
what does she do ?
yes . she was a psycho man .
you are right .

i 'm not sure .
yes i still remember .
my only books !
that sounds like a plan .
what about your brother ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .

i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
i think that 's enough .
do you like it ?
in private school .
are you sure ?
oh i teach you .
are there any other children ?
they do n't have enough room to go to a private school .
did you go to a private school ?
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it s easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i need to find this newspaper article .
anything else ?
oh yeah . here you go .
well . please accept our sincere apologies i 'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .

thanks . it s nothing special actually .
there 's no catch !
i went to bed last night .

well give it to me . i 'll keep going .
but we do have a discount after paying . . .
my wife will be going back to work soon .
i do n't think so .
yes i did .
it 's really good .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
it 's unfair .
all right .
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?
what 's the problem ?
do n't worry it 's not serious . you will get better soon .
i will .
i hope so .

excuse me . i wonder see dean mr . lee first . i was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that 's alright .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
he 's always busy .
it sure is .
what 's wrong ?
i see .
yes . i love it very much .
actually the scenery there is a beautiful view . it 's not so beautiful .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid fingerpointing when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
there is a charge on here that i never made .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
oh you 're right . that 's what we need to do .
i tried to introduce myself .
what 's that ?
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks honey . i went out of bed and it was nothing .
i think you should have known as long as we can get started .
that sounds like a good idea .
that s right .
i don t want to talk to my boss about it .
well .
no .
i wish i could stay with you more .
i m really sorry .
dave ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
who knows !
thank you for saying that .
oh really ?
thank you for your hospitality . i hope i will see you again soon .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take <unk> during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
yes i have .
i 'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . hum this one looks pretty good .
is that all you need ?
well i think there 's a mistake on the meter .
he likes to golf dance ?
i bought it a couple days ago .
will that be the sixth of september ?
yes . i 'll give you the receipt .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
why is there a dress code ? it is already made .
what were you reading ?
i know what you mean .
what 's the trouble ?
what are you talking about ? it 's not just the same .
really ?
yes . i ve nearly always been working with them .
i ca n't do that . what should i do ?
really ? why ?
okay i 'm a little confused .
how nice ! what is it ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some languageexchange program ?
what is it ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh i just ca n't forget it .
do you like to keep calm ?
yes i do .
it 's about the same .
let 's ask someone else .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
yes i like it very much .
how could it be ?
oh thank you . i 'll have a try .
what time does the next bus leave ?
no i am sorry . i thought you were supposed to call me tomorrow .
perhaps you 'll like a limo .
really ?
yes . i believe you can do a good job .
yeah i saw that .
which one do you mean ?
and now ?
what does it say ?
boring ? come on you clutched to my arm all the time .
i 'm glad to hear that .
are you planning on doing that ?
that 's what my father tells me almost everyday .
what 's your parents opinion ?
classical music ?
anything else ?
yes we are vegetables on the same floor .
so what are you thinking of doing ?
a cup of coffee please .
is there anything else you 'd like to do ?
just a moment please . i 'll have to try it .
would you like something to drink ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
he told me that his friend 's car broke down and they had to walk home .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some afterdinner wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in <unk> . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
sure . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i am going to the mountains with my family this afternoon .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
yes . we have your reservation .
yes i m not sure . do you know something about the computer ?
what were you talking about ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
how did he do that ?
look i need another drink . do you want one ?
that 's right . he is a hard worker and very well .
you can not tell him .
that 's true . he lost my bag .
he did n't say anything about it .
what 's his problem ?
yeah .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
to in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i refused it .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i missed it yesterday .
i think it 's fix now .
you have to turn it on the road .
where is this pencil ?
i can understand why you 'd like .
give me a few seconds sir .
well they used to have a guess .
i know . thank you .
have you got any idea about it ?
did you go to the university yet ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
i guess the personal internet is a problem . i do n't know what to do .
are you sure ?
i think the cause is a problem .
say how you know the place ?
do you think it 's proficient in both written and spoken english ?
yes it 's very expensive nowadays .
well it 's not usually . we can buy a used car then . it 's just around the corner .
i was in the bank at the time of the robbery .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
it 's a costs money !
it was very good .
come on . it was fun .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
where is it located ?
no i did n't .
do you think we 'll be able to travel by bus ?
i guess i was wrong .
how are you these days ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
thanks . i just got back from summer camp .
yes . thank you for all the same .
yes .
i 'm going to visit new york .
is that right ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
and your name please ?
yes i am .
have you found a place yet ?
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
i ca n't wait yet .
would you like anything else ?
i 'll appreciate your help .
hi steven . what 's up ?
i do n't think we have .
oh no .
yes .
yeah . i know .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
when you hear it change it means you have an outside line . where are you trying to call ?
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
ok . you have stayed for four nights at us dollars each and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . that makes a total of us dollars .
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on .
yes i think i can make it .
i am going to try my best .
can i get a burger or something ?
what 's the occasion ?
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i really do n't know .
i can tell you .
why ?
sure it 's a cell phone .
i 'm in a hurry .
today is december <unk> two thousand and two .
terrible .
terrible .
what did he do ?
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
not really . i like it very much .
ok . i want this one .
yes i do .
it 's perfect . here 's my list .
his voice wonderfully . it 's nice .
when is it ?
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music . have you ever been to the live show ?
of course here it is . reading films please .
wow you 're so lucky . i saw it on tv . but it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
congratulations . what was the real name ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
you really got it .
how so ?
i will . thank you for your help .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
yeah .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
well that 's terrible .
yes the <unk> is a very famous one .
good idea .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
really ?
i am playing the piano for the past week .
i see .
yes .
i think so too .
walk two blocks down the street .
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm afraid we have n't .
after a while <unk> .
ok . here you go .
first i worked as a servant .
the attendants fill the tank clean the windscreen and add some air to the tires .
it 's fun .
that would be great ! i hate working with computers !
that does sound interesting .
.
can i see everything with my resume ?
i have a big date tonight .
very good . any particular decade ?
it 's just convenient .
let me see . . . classical music is helpful .
and i can buy it if you like .
why is that ?
really ? i have an idea .
well generally speaking cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and spicy .
and can you tell me how to use other switches ?
of course . do you have the receipt with you ?
and i can make it before you buy it .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
that 's cool . i can play football with my friends .
i agree . i think it 's really a good idea .
i know what you mean .
well i ca n't stand it . i 'm not surprised .
is it all right ?
i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there 's anything she needs to make them easier ?
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
really ? that 's just perfect !
don t worry . that was a good idea .
i know . but the weather is so changeable in the summer .
ok . i 'll be back later .
of course ! i was playing games all day .
very good .
about ten times .
did you love it ?
you see . i have no idea what you are talking about .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
let 's see . . .
sounds like fun .
that 's a great idea .
he 's going to write a letter .
really ? it 's nice to see you again .
oh he knows . he speaks mostly english .
i 'm going to do it . thank you very much .
that was a great party .
no he did n't tell you .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?
how do you feel about it ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
but i do n't mind .
she 's true .
why do n't you just tell her ?
i was taking a walk in the park early this morning .
how about you ? do you have any other plans ?
you said it .
i hope you 'll recover soon .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
well do you have anything to declare ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include <unk> that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
but i 'm really busy .
she might do well . everyone seems to like her .
look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that 's why that car stops .
i still hear that . when did you move in ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
when is it ?
this job provides full medical dental and disability .
it sounds like a good idea .
to be honest i do n't really know what we 're going to do .
that 's cool . i can use the internet pretty well .
really ? is it safe ?
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
that 's true . sometimes it 's dangerous .
really ?
is it a good idea to be true ?
i am going to the gym at a good time . but it is really charming .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
how about meeting in my place ?
when did you say ?
me too .
ok . bye !
i 'm not sure . i think it 's a good idea .
hmm . i 'm sorry . that 's true .
oh no . money .
but we will definitely have to pay the rent .
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
oh no . i have n't heard of that before .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
lin is a common chinese last name .
please have a seat .
yes . is it easy to get around ?
what position are you looking for ?
thank you i 'll get it .
a korean film called friends starring sang <unk> .
i see . tell me about it .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
it 's true . the story and acting were outstanding .
i ca n't believe it .
i guess it could happen .
is this a promise ?
i 'm glad to hear that . bye !
enjoy yourself .
i appreciate it very much .
no wonder you are wrong .
what time ?
when is the big date ?
yes sunday sounds fine .
doing what ?
i d love to but i can t think of it .
sure . let s make tuesday on thursday . at a . m . on thursday .
how about then ?
hello is doris available ?
yes i do n't think so .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
at what time ?
really ? i bought this one .
no . where shall we meet ?
really ?
how do you want to pay for them ?
my name is luo gang and the phone number is .
yes it is .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
very good . thank you .
i think you have covered all the paperwork .
don t forget it .
is it very cold in the winter ?
me too . how 's the weather where you are ?
who is your favorite singer ?
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of seafood in it . they all look very fresh and delicious .
take care of yourself . it 's good to pamper yourself .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
i agree .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how 's it ?
no question about it . he was offside by a mile !
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't catch it .
for example ?
yeah i m still single .
i know . but why are you getting married ?
oh do n't you know how to use it ?
how so ?
i just got back from bali .
how did you spend the weekend ?
it certainly is . which country do you think will win ?
that is a nightmare . is that true ?
that 's a good idea . i will take care of it .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
is he really ?
about . he 's really outgoing . but why do you ask ?
but honey . . . got it .
i like wearing shorts in the world .
that 's exactly why i came for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
that 's a good idea .
i think so . hurry up !
what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn t just let them go . besides some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet .
yeah so what are they ?
no i m not sure .
is it really worth that ?
sports .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
you 're right .
not really .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
who are you a football player ?
that would be lovely .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
what do you like doing ?
light music and classic music .
how about samba and the tango ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
but i do n't like playing chess .
it sure is .
i like playing the piano .
you are smart . the lawn is beautiful and makes perfect .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you mary . it 's very kind of you .
what 's the problem ?
where ?
yes that 's my favorite .
let me tell you the story . in patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
well it might be this time .
what are we talking about ?
yes .
i think i 'll sign a back later .
what kind of sport is there ?
not really . when i was in primary school i was a child .
are you interested in this position ?
because i do n't have money and it 's fun and i have a lot of fun .
i 'm going to rockefeller center .
yeah it 's pretty nice but its so red because of air pollution .
good idea . there 're so many people here . i think it 's time to go .
where is the fitting room ?
it 's a beautiful city .
yeah . i 'm so excited .
i really appreciate it . thank you .
i like it very much .
yes i am . how about you ?
look this is a <unk> !
let me try it on .
is that true ? does it look good ?
that 's right .
i may have a try .
ok .
why ?
yes mr . du when are you born ?
because we 're partners .
oh breaktime flies .
not for a while .
i really appreciate your help .
that 's so terrible . you got hit your head .
have you brought your id with you ?
which seasons do they serve ?
i promise .
oh god . it 's fantastic ! i love this game .
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
that 's too bad . does he have a defence lawyer ?
his sister had a car accident last week .
yeah . he said he was coming home later on today .
yeah . he was alone .
good . i was thinking that i d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
that s right .
i 'm sorry . he wo n't do that .
what happened ?
how do you know that ?
i 've been playing football since high school .
it was a few things .
that 's terrible .
really ?
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
it did n't happen again .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
i want to try it .
well i do n't know if he 's a pet .
oh yes . i know !
well then what did you do ?
just fine and you ?
are you kidding ? i ca n't believe it .
no i 'm still single .
well there 's a lot to do then .
oh yes . i hope so .
yes that sounds like a good idea .
yes we do .
wow . that sounds like a good idea .
no . what do you mean ?
you got a new job .
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
what do you have in mind ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
do n't worry .
yeah . and a semi jackknifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
yes . is the office open now ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
do you ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
where did you go ?
thank you very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
what 's the matter ?
my advisor ?
not really . i 'm impressed .
my kevin .
i know tom is the best man in the field .
so wo n't you ?
it 's half past seven .
try it on .
not about five years ago .
it 'll take about minutes .
yes i can t believe it .
thank you !
thank you .
a little ?
yes please .
yes . why not ?
see you .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
how many kids do they have ?
we really believe that you are a highly qualified person . but the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
thanks for your help .
what 's the matter ?
i will work out if it 's ready .
it kept me awake a couple of hours .
all right . i 'll follow your advice .
yes . i 'm in a hurry .
are you sure ?
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s <unk> just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the <unk> so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in malaysia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
oh he 's and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
where are you going ?
not so good though his nephew took him to hospital to hospital .
no i ca n't .
would you like fill out this form please ?
i lost one hour ago .
look at the map .
maybe we 'll talk to them about it .
oh come on !
i think the guarantee will be economic law .
if you do n't mind me asking how can we do that ?
sounds like a lot of useful training . so you want to know more about it ?
that is what i want to do .
that 's easy . first of all what is your concept then ? then what does it look like ?
yes they are .
that 's a good idea . do n't worry about other people .
i do n't know .

is that all ?
how 's the set ?
i think i d prefer to do that .
how about sunday ?

good luck .
the problem is that i do n't think much about it .
then would you like to make another appointment ?
no problem . do you know anything about it ?
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
see you tomorrow .
that 's true . what do you think about it ?
excuse me . i wonder see dean mr . lee first . i was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?
good idea .
we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all our products .
have you ever been to the library ?
would you like to change it to a new one ?
do you have any identification ?
the internet operates hours a day seven days a week and can be accessed anywhere .
i see . do you send an email ?
what do you mean by that ?
how much is the fee ?
i 'm not sure . but the problem is even more complicated .
sometimes i think so . but what is true ?
what 's the problem ?
perhaps it would be a steelstring or a classical guitar .
it 's the best we can do .
sure . it is also a huge one .
i got it .
what does that mean ?
so he said he 'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks .
ok .
no i missed a lot .
let 's watch a hand .
take it easy . stand at the end of the mountain .
cool !
not yet .
this machine is out of order .
thank you for saying so . i 've been looking forward to this library .
i know .
anything else ?
i see . thank you very much .
yes . what can i do for you ?
how about going there to have a look now ?
what 's the occasion ? you won the lottery ?
oh that 's easy for me . i think it 's really a good deal .
i suppose so .
i do n't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the street ?
that 's interesting . so what are we going to do then ?
of course . after six months we 'll give you a special price .
that 's good .
my mother just passed away last night .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
i have no idea .
didn t you know that ?
yes i think so .
wow . it looks like she was a psycho .
well i lost my grandpa when i was only ten . i often recall the period when he fed me .
i have a student .
what school do you go to ?
i am studying in eastern asian language department .
i certainly hope so .
yes i enjoyed it very much .
thank you . goodbye .
ok i will .
thanks .

i 'm most sorry .

really ?
three times a week .
i 'm sure we do .
they were stolen .
oh that 's a good idea . i 'll think about it .
oh no i 'm leaving tomorrow . we 've got plenty of time .
really ? why ?
my pleasure .
whatever !
ok then you can teach me how to play the game .
yes . the language is hard to learn but it 's interesting .
i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
take some medicine and stay in bed for a day .
thank you for all your help .
certainly .
here you go . bye !
ok . you 're in luck .
what do you recommend ?
can you give me a lift ?
i hope you will like it .
try a car wash and selling candy .
i prefer playing chess .
playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
oh thank you for almost years .
ok .
see you .
what is it ?
do you know something ?
no quite the contrary .
i want to know what you are doing .
but she was too busy .
i m not sure . but i see .
what is it ?
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school . it gives you discounts on all kinds of things . movies pizza clothing school supplies .
well have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
how about the color ?
i can t believe it .
i thought you 'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i 'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do is to get on the train tonight at pm .
really ?
i know you have a tight schedule so i wo n't take up more of your time . have a good evening .
you ca n't say that again .
thanks .
i hope so .
no this is my first time and i think it 's my fault .
i don t think i ll do that .
but cartons are quite limited .
it would n't be scary .
ok but the sunshine is too strong .
but if the sunshine is too strong it might damage the eyes and the skin .
is that so ?
okay that 's good .
i love the sage green carpeting with the sunsetcolored walls .
i would like to choose from the big interest rate .
i do n't know .
a foot massage sounds great . what else can we do ?
i had no idea .
i know what you mean . i love the warning .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
yes . the names of the thames there s the way of pollution .
yes . why ?
well i came to know a girl three weeks ago . we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
honey i ca n't tell him .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you 've got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
i want to have a heart attack .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
thank you lisa .
cheers . it 's so beautiful .
i wish you good luck !
yeah . the air is so beautiful . i like it at night !
and the tango ?
it 's nothing .
what 's your favorite kind ?
i love them !
thanks .

i do n't know .
thank you .
no problem .
why not ?
what 's the weather like in your country ?

thank you . now it 's been a long time has n't it ?
i bought it in this cafe .
i m not sure .
great ! when is your birthday ?
i will try my best . so what do you think of it ?
i 'm not disciplined enough i guess .
yeah .
ok .
how do you say it ?
then you must be very shy .
just like them .
oh no . .
which one ?
she has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
i guess you ca n't work without candy .
thanks for saying that . give me one of those .
you 're a real man !
ok .
yes i am . what 's up ?
look this is a <unk> !
so go then .
of course i am . i 'm really looking forward to seeing you .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
that 's too bad . how can i get there ?
i have no idea .
all right . i think we will have a shopping cart .
how about ?
ok .
yes that 's right .
not at all .
i hope so . goodbye .
thank you . i appreciate it very much .
i 'd be very glad to hear from you .
thank you very much .
take it easy .
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun .
i honestly do n't know .
i 'll meet you soon .
what for ?
i have n't eaten anything in the house .
thanks ! these are beautiful . you should n't have !
thank you . same to you .
yes i have my family and i 'll be working with you .
do you have the ever been there ?
the same to you !

do n't worry . ought to be outside .

yes ?
about . he 's really outgoing . but why do you ask ?
i can t believe it .
speaking .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect politics to be true anyway .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
i really want to go about a month .
that 's really good . ok i 'll have a try .
i do n't know .
that sounds fine . thank you very much for your help .
so are you sure ?
really ? that 's a good idea .
i 'll have a try .
i am going to travel to london .
how long have you been here ?
i have a big date tonight .
how long will it take to get there ?
what 's that ?
sounds like a good idea .
how long does it take ?
what are your parents going to college ?
you too .
sure i have . i liked it very much .
star war .
what did it say ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in haitian district where there are lot of universities .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thanks . how are you ?
oh i have n't been well . how are you ?
how about next time we meet at my place ?
good to see you too !
spring .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
why do n't you phone her for a date again ?
ok . let 's go .
do n't worry . the bus is always worth while .
uh . . . so are you ready for it ?
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
what do they look like ?
i really hate this weather .
poor fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the st april april april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on th may .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
how long will it take ?
how about ?
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was very good .
what did it say ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
where is it located ?
no . it was a total snack .
do you think we 'll be able to travel by bus ?
when i entered the room i forgot to close the door . then i couldn t help smoking .
i guess i just got back from summer camp .
yes . thank you for all the same .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
for me the times of online shopping .
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
oh yeah ! i m really sorry .
i m going to get a snickers or a kit kat .
they are . let 's sing all the way out there .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
yes we did .
um . . .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
but i love them very much .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i 'm really tired .
who s that ?
yes it was hot but warm .
hey ! how do you know the weather there ?
i can adjust to the price of charge .
but the bus takes too long . it 's not so crowded .
in the north of the streets it is .
i love them but i do n't think much of them .
so it is i bet that some day .
that 's right .
i have n't seen you for ages . is n't it a good one ?
give me a break then .
no but i 'm used to it .
why is that ?
perfect !
i m glad to hear that . i ll come again sometime soon .
no sir . but i think it will be dangerous .
yeah i have .
oh did you play table tennis ?
it was great . i 'm glad i brought you to come .
yes i play quite fast .
yeah . we ve invested in a lot of money .
ok let 's do that then .
i went to the library and lost my bag .
how did you do that ?
i was an accident .
ok well in that case you can go with me .
what 's the matter ?
what was the worst feeling ?
here you are .
you are welcome .

that s normal for anyone with a <unk> .
but i have something to do .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your <unk> opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i knew this would happen some day . . .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped <unk> .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .

then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah i know what we want to do .
yes i have .
they re beautiful . what 's the matter ?
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .

what makes you say that ?
what do you want to do ?
i love you too dad . you know he s a good guy .
that s great . can you take some time to get together ?
anything else ?
not bad . he must be lonely .
wow a lot does n't it ? a new one ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
when are you going to buy it ?
why ?

i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
it 's not my fault . i ca n't bear it .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable but if the materials <unk> it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .

how do you do ?
how do you do ?
thank you .
a bottle of champagne .

i 'll get it on well with you .
we will have an interview as soon as possible .
i m glad that the wine won t be good .
hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working on these days .
how about tomorrow ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the st of may . oh dear . arm . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
very good you majored in international trade ?
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
ok . bye .
bye .
my pleasure . let s go and get a drink .
thanks .
i 'm glad that you like it .
thank you for saying that .
i d like to do it if i could .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i 'm a teacher .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
is it a bit expensive ?
may i know what you do ?
yes . i 'd like to .
yes .
will that be the sixth of september .
of course . well let me just grab a pad and pen .
how much are you asking ?
what are you going to do ?
tomorrow ?
that s all right . we re expecting you .
as soon as possible . i m free tomorrow afternoon .
i ll try to catch you later .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is <unk> chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
it 's a good idea . i 'll teach you how .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
in that case let s be careful !
what is that ?
we have a variety of products from cosmetics daily necessities .
i 'll help you .
really ? are you going to continue working in the future ?
used to . but now the game is too old to play in a fierce game like this . .
then i decided to quit my present job .
what ?
oh do you know what you 're talking about ?
no . will you get a job ?
that 's a very good idea . i can help you with that .
exactly . by the way what are we talking about ?
but it will be a good opportunity .
what seems to be the problem ?
i see . take it easy . i 'm sure you can do well .
really ? have you ever been using anything ?
me too . i do n't feel any way to keep myself away from my life .
what are you worried about ?
well why do you want to meet me ?
what 's that ?
that 's the purpose of the meeting .
what are they ?
not much . how about you ?
right .
sounds like fun ! when will it be ?
well i know it 's quite a when you get married .
of course we did . but i was in the middle of the conversation . . .
thank you a lot we 'll try our best .
that 's exactly what i was thinking .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
that 's right .
i do n't like drinks .
i did n't know that .
yes i mailed in an absentee ballot .
you 'll cook it of course !
so what are you going to do ?
no not really .
yes it will be fun .
where s the area ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
i m not sure yet . i don t know what to do .
can i sit down now ?
it 's yuan per month .
how much is it ?
but it s expensive .
yeah i need to get it tomorrow .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
thanks . i ll call you later .
okay . i ll pick you up around
thank you mr . johnson . you ve made a guaranteed reservation at the guangzhou xx hotel from april th to th for nights . if you can t arrive as schedule please inform us before p . m . on april . hank you for calling and we look forward to serving you
yes it was a pleasure .
i see . now what s the problem ?
no i did n't know that .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
well i was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! can you believe that ?
it 's really a great idea .
yes . it 's really worth seeing . by the way i 'd like to buy some souvenirs .
it 's made of pure silk and it 's very hot .
that 's cool ! it must be amazing and convenient for each other .
how so ?
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes .
i 'm not sure .
yes i 've been working here too .
will you make it ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
what are they ?
you 're right .
could you have gotten it please ?
of course i 'll .
you need to keep it at .
well i guess i m not a good idea . i don t know what to say .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
really ?
nice to see you too .
thank you very much . i ve been working very hard .
what are you going to do ?
thanks for saying that . i appreciate it .
and where ?
yes i will . i can put a lot of things in it .
really ? where is it ?
so are we .
it 's a quiet onebathroom apartment .
and how about your spanish ?
they do . they are very fresh .
yeah but that is a good idea . it s not too expensive .
yes it is . there are three bedrooms a living room a dining room and a big kitchen .
what was the rent ?
let s just give you a few minutes .
you can buy it right away .
have you talk to her about it ?
thank you .
do you really think so ?
yeah you have some other ideas ?
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
i do n't like the food . what kind of food do you like ?
oh you didn t have to . . .
i bet you 'll love them .
thank you for saying that .
have you ever tried the ads ?
what am i supposed to do ?
sorry i can t .
nice to meet you !
i 'm hungry .
yeah it 's a good idea then . let 's look at this one .
one moment please .
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
let me know if he does n't mind .
what makes you say that ?
yeah .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own .
someone has stolen my cell phone .
it does n't matter . you can still learn a lot from them .
what is it ?
we provide free training on state of the art equipment .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get start on probation ?
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
as a matter of fact we are running out of charge .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
absolutely .
yes . i 'm fond of playing the chess and i 'm very keen on playing cards .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
fine thanks . and you ?
do n't worry . i can introduce my friends to you .
yes i agree with you .
how do you like it ?
that 's my wife and i .
can you repeat that ? i ca n't believe it .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
fine . and you ?
that will be beautiful .
oh boy you should have stayed on line with her .
but look at the girls in the street . they all look great .
take your time !
i like football .
take a walk down the street .
i 'm reading about michael milliken the bond king .
why ?
bingo !
my favorite is to play computer games .
romantic ? i ca n't remember what you said .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
thank you !
i m glad to hear that . i thought they were doing well .
i can design a lot . here it is .
i do n't know . i hate music .
oh it was terrific . i learned a lot .
perhaps you should look at them .
i don t think so .
because i loved it .
thanks .
yes i agree . but there is a lot to learn .
i have no idea .
fine . see you later .
definitely !
yes i hope so .
i hope to study english literature but i am not sure .
thank you for your compliment .
you 're a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
what kind of music do you like best ?
what else do i need to do to help me ?
you can see it now .
oh it 's interesting . i think we had a fight last time .
sure that would be a good idea .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
what do you think about it ?
yeah me too .
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look .
are you sure about it ?
i think they are ok and i want to buy one home .
you have to take care of yourself .
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you .
no i don t know much about them .
how do i use the internet ?
have you updated your cv ?
that 's good .
the price is very high .
ok . here 's the money .
can you give me a definite answer please ?
good . maybe we can find some information on the internet .
how about photography ?
we can take a look at the gate .
the food there is actually pretty good .
how long have you been playing the violin ?
they do a good job .
thank you .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
that s true isn t it ?
i ca n't see it .
you do n't like the food there ?
i know . i do n't like milk .
do they do a good job ?
yes i can .
that s right . i love them too !
yeah ! i m really excited about it !
yeah . it 's the biggest zoo in taiwan .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
oh he 's and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
i see . thank you for your help .
yes and sometimes the minimum time deposits .
that is true . when is your decision ?
yes .
that 's what i should do .
ca n't you see the notes there ? it says no smoking here .
yeah you are right . thanks a lot .
yes . have you ever been there ?
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
do you know where it is ?
what 's the matter ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like horror movies .
well do n't blame me ! i never get a chance to watch tv .
oh dear . well we can t wait to watch horror movies .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
what they are .
oh yeah . it seems a lot of funny .
the compact ? are you kidding ?
bill and betty have already grown up .
bingo !
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but you agreed to go out with me at last .
smile i can t believe this for it s been years since we got married .
what type of movie is that ?
but i am not sure . and it really broke .
i agree with you . he 's a good guy .
i feel that history is about to be made .
oh well it 's how expensive !
what other kind of food do you like ?
yeah . it s fantastic to believe he won the lottery .
good idea . let 's make it .
yes . his iq is high enough for the success as long as he can manage his eq .
the <unk> is final at the end of this month . it 's a total price .
sure . here you are .
well what 's on tonight ?
it 's a quiz show .
ok .
it was a good game was n't it ?
but she s not a fine <unk> friend who could sell you down the river .
what 's her personality like ?
ok ! let 's go and see what we have .
it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
cool ! i heard he is a good player .
what did you think of his film ?
absolutely .
i like the sight .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that scans all <unk> so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of spamunwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star s private live in recent years .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
<unk> really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks a lot .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about or places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an <unk> program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several <unk> the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i ll probably take it .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it s harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
i agree . maybe you re right .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
it 's true .
thank you .
i m sorry .
i could n't agree with you more . do you have a suggestion ?
well . probably you believe that history is changing .
if they break more than they won .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
have you taken the test ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his <unk> ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
well this is the only thing i really wanted to do .
what a pity !
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
yes maybe you are right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
that 's great . thank you .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
ca n't you see the notes there ? it says no smoking here .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ?
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
no no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
wow ! you look just as <unk> as dilbert !
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will <unk>
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in chinese more in chinese so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
absolutely . that s the array of nationalities . i never know how they are .
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be <unk> grateful . i bet you it will even <unk> mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here sa beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is wrong with you ? a lot of work !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
ahahah . . .
looks like you re a lifesaver !
have you got any yet ?
she is a teacher .
if i can t make it this afternoon i ll be ready in a minute . .
yes . four adults and two children .
mmm . . . let s get both of them !
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
how would you like to make sure ?
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
don t worry . i think we re going to sign a contract yet .
i think that s what i need .
oh i see . what s the problem ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what a great deal !
i m sure i ll enjoy some television .
i m so sorry to hear that .
i 'm just watching some television .

i 'm just watching some television .
i know what you mean . i m really sorry .

my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
but i m just in it for the money right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides i love the smell of gasoline don t you ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
ahahah . . .
i ve got a fever and a bad headache .
what s the matter ? are you kidding ?
how about there ?
haha . no idea what you 're going to do .

ok i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .

you know just giving me lots to do . i 'm really busy right now .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
oh lots of things . mostly training new people .
come on ! we need a break .

it 's a great game .

oh thanks a lot . that 's very nice of you .
all right . if i will have a good time .
i wish you luck .
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
yeah .
ok .
go ahead .
ok . how about playing tennis with me ?
yeah i think so . oh by the way i need to ask you something .
what 's that ?
it 's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . many people resolve to quit smoking lose weight or stop nagging their wife etc . however it usually lasts only for a few days !
sure . oh that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
my boots ? er . . . sure ok .
we are going to travel to london .
really ? how was it ?
oh no . she s so beautiful .
all right .
well . . . actually . . .
can you tell me something about your financial position ?
thank you .
i can t believe that .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
hmm . that s a good idea . let s have a try .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
did you have anything to declare ?
you need to type your pin in .
so you ve seen a florida ?
do n't overdo it .
i have been planning on doing some work .
it will be hard to learn .
oh i m fine . and you ?
i like playing basketball .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
of course . i enjoying it very much .
what kind of sports do you like to go to ?
well i used to exercise when i was at university but i still do n't know how to use it .
that 's a good idea . you should exercise more easily .
i think it s time !
what s your opinion ?
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ? what 's the matter ?
which subway should i take to get to the east side ?
you are right . i ca n't believe it .
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
again ?
i m sure we can work together .
if he did n't believe it or not he would marry a handsome man .
i think this man would be the best choice .
of course i did .
yes i remember that .
hmm . . . well why don t you go to work then ?
do you have a map of the campus ?
that s a good idea . but without doing it is very difficult to learn .
how many hours do we have to pay ?
yes . but we still need to learn about the olympic games .
yes . i ve got to run out of the exercise every day . it s easy to keep fit .
ok . i like to play the piano .
nothing really . what 's new with you ?
hmm . . . i do n't know what you mean . .
well i 'm glad to hear that .
it is close to the subway .
thank you .
why do n't you stay here longer ? we 'll just stay in the parking lot .
i 'm sorry for hero .
i do n't understand . what does he do ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover .
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like avoiding <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no he did n't . so he was definitely following me .
have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? if everyone is discontent with their work of course they wo n't stick <unk> .
no they had no reason for arresting me .
that seems the right way . do you think you are going to quit the job ?
so i should pay attention to the external expressions .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
yes next march .
yes it was .
is it true ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
you can reach me . . .
what for ?
good idea .
you should put on your jacket .
it looks good on you . but it 's too small for me .
how could i get that ?
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
it 's ok .
so what were you calling me about ?
you are always so hospitable .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
ok . we will wait for you .
then i 'm glad you like it .
ah yes .
ok .
ah yes but i often go to the gym .
i see .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
dad i do n't mind you 're right .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
ahahah . . .
i had my first cigarette when i was .
yes i 'd love to go to her store . so i do n't want to go to her .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
i do n't know .
supervisor . open the door .
thank you .
sorry mum i 'll lock it right away .
all right .
honey i will give you a hand .
good idea .
i would n't mind a burger .
i 'm fine .
that 's not a good idea . let 's go and have a look .
oh give me a break .
yeah . it 's a basketball match .
do n't worry . you 'll just have to wait a few days .
when ?
no he won t !
i thought you were good at the high jump !
take it easy . i hope you will like them .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm getting ready .
i have no idea . i m not sure about it .
what application materials should i take ?
oh i forgot about it . i 'll get it .
right .
i went to bed early .
spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
then i 'll have to work overtime .
maybe i should apply my knowledge and experience to a career counselor .
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
they did .
what was the score ?
well it was to but ripen s home run made it to since another player was on first base .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
i went to visit an uncle in san francisco .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fares ?
follow me please .
i see . anything else ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
it does n't matter .
when will the plane take off ?
no you do n't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
please wait a moment .
ok . could you tell me when you are ready ?
a party of .
alright we are waiting for you at .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . it 's all yours .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
you 're welcome .
yeah . i ve told him a lot about him .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
i do n't know .
me too .
ok . i 'll call you saturday morning .
ok . let s go .
well an american company .
how do you feel about it ?
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
my iq score is slightly above average .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did .
are you sure ?
yes i did . that 's what i thought .
actually some people in different countries have the same opinion .
hello is doris available ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?

you 're right .
ok let 's try it .

what 's wrong with it ?
really ? is it serious ?
thank you for helping me .
i know that . maybe you 'd better go to the gym with me .
here you are . these tablets are very effective .
i hope so .
well . give me a chance !
it s very kind of you .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
will i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes thank you . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
nothing .
can you fill it out ?
i do n't know .
never mind . i 'll do it .
i was there for about three years .
all right !
thanks a lot .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no we do n't .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
it sure is .
yeah i do n't mind it either .
sure . but it won t be much fun anyway .
i 'm looking forward to it .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
no they would have none of them .
that was an odd change of subject .
really ? i thought it was going to be a great movie .
i think i was hot too .
not at all . take a seat . now what can i do for you ?
that 's really kind of you .
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
no i hate swimming . i prefer playing tennis .
oh it 's interesting i like it very much .

sure i hope so .
wow that 's really interesting . i thought they were really interesting .

that 's great ! have you got any plans ?
we re looking at the moment .
how is your job going ?
well that s all right .
me too . i hope you ll do well .
pardon ?
i love burnt bread .
i would like a cup of coffee .
would you like some ice in your drink ?
peas and carrots .

no i do n't drink . it 's a glass of champagne .
i hope you 'll like it .
we sell them here .
where shall we sit ?
i don t know what to wear .
he s doing well .
is the suspect in this line ?
sure you really have to .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
thank you .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i am going to travel to china after graduation .
what were you thinking of doing ?
i have to go to work .
how much would you like to stay ?
medicine .
i have a same idea as your hotel .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous .
by subway .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
but it 's not the same in winter .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
it would be a beautiful city .
thank you .
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . so we are taking you into custody .
i wonder if it 's going to rain .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
the weatherman says it 's going to snow tomorrow .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
hi bob . why ?
what are you doing ?
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
how old is he today ?
it 's his th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
classic . something that could calm your mind .
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i see . maybe the programmes inside the advertisements .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what they think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from china .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of .
did they take his license away ?
no they are really easy on him . the problem is that that that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not the same . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
it was a nightmare .
yes i do .
i think it 's the best way to save money .
yuan . so you can buy it .
they were stolen . let me buy one for you .
true . so what do you think of this one ?
yes i know . i think it 's the biggest problem in my life . the only problem is the price .
well i thought you knew .
july .
yes . is there anything else i can do for you ?
they think so .
i have no idea . the government is becoming more and more common .
i do n't know but it 's none of my life .
yes but we get together at the end of this year .
i was hoping that we could come up early this afternoon .
well now we 're stuck . what can you do ?
so what ? how did you do ?
we could take a rest for you .
yes .
why ?
the rent is each month .
well that 's stock is n't it ?
i always have the temptation to eat something there .
what do you mean ?
yeah i 'm not sure .
i see . thanks for calling .
i 'm not sure yet .
do you have a lot of money there ?
no i have n't .
i always get excited the day before .
sure .
i 'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
well i hope so .
it was really nice of you .
is it expensive ?
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh that means it 's a quarter to seven .
that short guy on her right . what 's his name ?
yeah .
there is no doubt that he is in prison .
does it suit me ?
what 's your favorite number ?
why ?
it 's clive !
well what are your spoils ?
why ?
are you ready to use them for yourself ?
why ?
really ? why not ?
good question . i have to think about it .
and you never know what happened to her ?
oh yes . i was a <unk> .
i will think about it .
ok . i will think about it .
good question . i have to think about it .
ok .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
well i really want to think about it .
that 's a good idea .
ok . i guess i have to think about it .
but do n't you have any hobbies ?
let 's do it for you .
i have confidence in them .
i wish i had a yours .
i have confidence in saying so .
in that case you re right .
i 'm sure you will .
hello jim . i 'm sorry about that . what is it ?
they are .
i 'll think it over .
how did you know that ?
sure .
okay .
it looks like you are a father .
good idea . i have to think about it .
let me check .
definitely .
oh yeah . i know . thank you .
what are they ?
that 's easy !
why is that ?
well if we do n't have much time i 'll watch tv .
good . i have to think about it .
nope . i 'm not sure but my friend likes it .
oh . that 's what i was thinking .
hi lily ! how is everything ?
not bad . i really need to find a job .
yes they are working on it . you may be settled .
they 're just gifts .
it certainly is . what do you think we should do ?
what kinds of team do you have in mind ?
so what about your boss ?
what about your salary ?
i agree with you .
it 's great ! what do you want to do ?
can t be better .
i did n't know you had a big wedding .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about you ?
how old is your sister ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
yes that 's true .
that 's true .
for many people like their parents .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
sure . we have a lot of fun .
i see ! which season does it say ?
yes . thank you .
hi david . it s my birthday .
oh come on ! i know you are a good singer . you do n't have hot chocolate cakes .
sorry sir . i can t wait . it 's a bit too small .
what is it ?
i 'm a ring from her father .
well let 's think about it for some time . . .
okay i 'll give you a call later .
put on your hand .
look after my mom . that 's what i want to say .
you 're a real fan of games .
thank you doctor . goodbye .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
see you .
i 'm starving !
yes i do .
there is no problem . i 'll get it for you .
i use it online . i usually surf the net and check my email to send messages to my friends .
that 's a good idea . i ll show you when you 're online .
me too . i want to know more about you eg what 's your real name and what do you look like . .
that 's fine . if you want me to be able to help you do that .
i m a big fan of staff .
oh no !
are the local internet access ?
that 's what i want to do .
i was supposed to call home this morning .
who is the vote for ?
my head hurts badly .
what ?
it is a job at an advertisement company .
yes i do .
yes i wish i could but my life is n't yours .
when we go to a conference our company what are you looking for ?
thank you for the information . i will .
i m not sure . well let me try to find a new one .
you 're welcome .
i like playing the violin .
there 's a good movie called summer in beijing .
those are so bad .
i like to do something .
i love you too . it 's a good movie .
i see .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
where are your parents ?
i go to london twice a week .
what s your favorite movie ?
it 's by the end of the week .
well we can give you a hand .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
but i still get a stock record at the moment .
sure no problem . you can try them on .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all genres except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of <unk> friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and bawling whole <unk> of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll preface a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a kissass . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hiphop or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
ok . two tickets to london please .
i know it 's going to be sunny today .
what 's the temperature ?
i guess so .
give me a chance .
i really appreciate the beautiful weather .
i could not agree with you more .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .
where are you from ?
i m . what s more his wife is .
i 'll send it by air thank you .
really ?
i was scared .
is it a long way to get there ?
the one that stole a small plane ?
he 's got a fever and sunday .
of course i did !
do you have any experience in mind ?
that 's right .
it 's really good .
sue this is george .
so what ?
i hate talking to him but he doesn t bother me .
there 's a wrong number .
right .
that 's true .
you know he has blond hair and brown eyes .
image ?
maybe .
oh yes . you 're right .
yes .
no not really . it depends on what you wear .
you 're right . i 'll give it a try .
nothing .
what should i do ?
then i 'll try one .
i could not agree with you more . i am so angry with you .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space shuttles are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet humankind will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
is that right ?
france ? is he crazy ?
yeah the play is perfect !
what do you mean ?
ok . i ll take it .
yeah .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for .
would you take ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for . how about ?
. ?
sorry is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean . i 'm like a yoyo .
i 'm sorry sir . we are currently tonight . may i have your name please ?
it s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . nobody sticks around in the summer .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh ! it s at .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate .
oh great ! that 's at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate !
be patient ! drive slowly !
i 'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . my training lasts for two years . two days a week i study engineering at a local college . if i pass all my exams i hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
you re welcome . i ll give you the number .
it s a very cool job .
what are you going to do ?
i work as a teacher .
yes here you are .
what 's the price for this one ?
may i help you with something ?
read me the number !
my major was accounting .
my parents want me to take care of everything .
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you ever get lonely living at home ?
i hope to make good progress in my work .
i hope so .
my neighbor hit my brother on the head .
i know i appreciate that .
i was married for three years .
maybe you are right .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
and after the date ?
i 'm not sure .
why not ?
about seven years now . and you ?
here is your money .
i 'm not sure .
i m so happy .
my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my mom my stepdad and me . how about you ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we re identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete <unk> when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i don t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i don t have a blood relationship with my stepfather and stepbrother i consider them to be my real family .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
yes i did . it was excellent .
i see . good luck .
oh my god !
oh it 's interesting .
he 's not easy to find things .
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
what does he do ?
he 's tall and slim fairhaired .
ok . i 'll see you later . he says he 's a better guy .
he was alone .
but his business is not very happy .
he 's fixing his roof .
i was born in xinjiang .
what was your childhood like ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
they did n't ! are they glad that you moved in yesterday ?
no they don t .
maybe they suit him .
my parents wanted me to stay in beijing but i decided to go back to england . i graduated from university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross culture communication .
what university did you have in ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
how do you find studying a book ?
yes i did .
really ?
i graduated from high school .
i 'm so happy for you .
no i 'm a teacher .
i like the rhythms .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
well i do n't think that they could be independent .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
don t you think you would miss having other people around ?
no i do n't think i 'm over .
how could your family be there ?
that 's true . but as a woman i 'm glad that even though i don t want any children i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand i have a onechild policy !
well it 's true i guess . some day a lot of my customers are pretty good .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
thank you for helping me . you really did n't have the work . i am sure i can do my work .
you are so kind . thank you for helping me .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it 'll come to me .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
ok . you have stayed for four nights at us dollars each and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . that makes a total of us dollars .
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i 'd remember it .
you really have a big head do n't you .
i 'm not sure but probably about years . how about in your country ?
about i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it 's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
but that 's true .
he 's fine .
how old is he going to make it ?
i had mine when i was . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
well there 's no point in my life .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
so why do you think the world is a good idea ?
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
yeah you re right . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i think i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
what are you going to do ?
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
but i still need to find out what i m looking for .
no way .
thanks . you are right .
i guess maybe but i just don t understand the reason .
that 's true . what do you think i should do ?
what do you mean ?
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
if that happens maybe she would get a hold of it .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ?
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and <unk> them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
yeah that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
ok .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
whatever .
what are you going to do there ?

well it sounds like an excellent idea . i kind of exercise is really worth it .
well in that case we can take you hang <unk> with one of our experienced instructors . it s the closest you can get to flying .
what ? you mean <unk> myself to a flimsy kite ? no thank you ! next !
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge .
i m thinking something exciting but safer .
i have the perfect option this package will take you on a hiking trip through the himalayas for three days and afterwards there s a dog sledding journey !
that s more like it !
thank you .
ah thank you . please bring your luggage here for inspection .
i 'm coming from fair oaks and las flores drive in altadena .

i ll be here for approximately three weeks .

thank you .
where are you going now ?
i see . thank you .
thank you . how much is it ?
i have no choice .
how much do you need to pay ?
no i do n't .
why ?
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful <unk> for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
do you have a reservation ?
oh the final exam is coming soon . i feel a little bit nervous .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
thanks .
thank you for choosing bruno 's . we look forward to seeing you on the nd .
that sounds interesting . are there any way i have to go there ?
so what are the meals ?
no they do n't .
i think it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
it s beautiful but crowded .
yeah that s it ? what s the charge ?
yes i have .
do you want to send someone to fix it ?
oh it s so nice of you .
i see .
that 's all right . i ll get it for you .
and do i have to pay extra ?
what do you mean ?
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
no i haven t decided yet .
that s fine . i ll let you know your application materials .
but i m dealing with it . have you ever been there before ?
how ay years have you been working with him ?
they 're most advanced .
have you received your resume ?
well there are several private companies .
i m not sure .
well they do n't have any presents .
i 'd like to book a ticket to new york . my name is liu fan .
ok . could i have your name please ?
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
thank you very much .
thank you .
that 's a reasonable price .
that 's great . thank you .
a pleasure .
certainly .
yes here you go .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
if we do n't hurry up we will be able to get the airport .
i hope so .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm going to visit new york .
is that right ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
that s a good idea . you re a lifesaver .
yes i am .
why ?
how much do are you looking to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
i ca n't wait yet .
would you like anything else ?
yes he is appreciate your help .
let me check sir . according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
well the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
so are you ready ?
thank you .
there 's a problem with the quality exchange rate . how can i guarantee you ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
i 'm afraid not sir .
i see . thank you .
actually i do n't think i 've ever had enough money to eat .
sure .
just one trim will do .
is she strict with you ?
great . i think that is what i want to do then .
what should i do ?
i like that ! could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ?

thank you we 'll do our best .

but it is not necessary .
i have to think about it .
well . . .
cash or credit card ?
yes i will .
are you sure ?
i see .
i m not sure .
but is there anything else i can do for you at the moment ?
it 's just a case of driving phone .
why should i do that ?
we can provide you with standby letter of credit .
still you should not let down your guard . some details should be paid attention to .
that 's true .
oh no .
how was it due ?
hum . . .
that sounds like a nightmare .
i was wondering if you could give me a raise .
could we try it on ?
well . you can send it to me directly .
i 'm afraid not .
it does n't cost anything for the pass .
thank you .
pretty good .
it was about o 'clock in the morning .
thank you for your help .

i m a keyboard operator . what s your job ?
wow ! you re a lifesaver !
they say we have to .
that 's fine . if you are not happy with your work performance would you tell me a little bit about your work ?
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done . second i always meet deadlines . if i say i 'm going to do something i do it .
have you ever heard about that before ?
they would say i am a responsible friend and a capable colleague .
she 's a consummate professional and a teamplayer . i have utmost confidence in her abilities .
well mr . black i think i 'm ready for a job and it 's more important to me .
do you know anything about your salary ?
no we have n't .
is she married ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
that is very important .
she is not going to be a private assistant .
what are your salary expectations ?
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is very important .
i think i am proficient in both written and spoken english .
that 's true . what about your coworkers ?

well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
how do you like your salary ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the family whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the <unk> mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
of course i do . but what shall we do ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's a good idea .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
oh shut up ! now let 's go ahead .

i think swimming will be a very good idea if we are willing to pay more . it 's the most important thing to do .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a commission will not be much .
i think it 's easy to get around . in fact there are lots of stores in the same country .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
our agents in other areas usually get a commission .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a commission will not leave us much .
that 's what i thought . i just want to do .
i 'll have to think about it .
yeah that s the one .
usually the commission is three percent of the total amount .
all right . here 's the money .
by the way i would like to sign a contract for this agreement .

the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
i 'm sorry but our budget is a little tight .
well i hope so .
i think the inspection bureau at your end when effecting inspection only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly most probably escaped their attention . as the amount in question is only of the whole shipment i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
no . later we decided to opt for the prior outline version .
i think all of that .
mr . smith ? you are leaving two weeks from now .
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i am .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i think it 's too hard to say .

yes please .
yes speaking . can i help you ?
i am calling to check your information before the interview . what position did you apply ?
what kind of things do i need to take ?
it 's on the first floor .
yes what can i do for you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch .
that 's great ! thank you .
sure . here it is .
who 's calling ?
but could you tell me when he will be back ?
anytime except today .
this is nathaniel brown .
that 's right .
please do n't mention it .
maybe . how about the airport ?
i hope so .
in that case i 'll take it .
how about this afternoon ?
no problem .
i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely .
you do n't need to worry about it .
certainly .
that 's easy .
do you think we can make it ?
all right .
oh i remember .
but thank you very much all the same .
i see . and what 's the title of your product ?
i see .

great . i 'll have a try .
no thank you
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how are you doing ?
doctor . i 'm sorry he has an appointment with his company .
yes speaking . can i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .

i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
yes i do .
the employees will be training after this period .
when will you be able to deliver ?
we really believe that you are a highly qualified person . but the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
i think that 's ok .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to work in an office of marketing .
why do you want to quit ?
i 'll do my utmost if i am hired .

tomorrow is .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over hour late .
i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?

oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
this is he .
why ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?

please wait a minute .
i am ok . thank you .
good . he is the lucky guy .
really ? thank you .
i know it is really hard to solve the problem .
if so we find it difficult to go on with our talks .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is your proposal ?
your unit price is dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
i have no idea . how much is it ?
what do you mean ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
great . let 's go !
that 's a good deal . what 's the exchange rate ?
can i get a reduction for you ?
i only need to buy a few dollars .
all right .
is there any cheaper one ?
this is the best we can offer .
all right . let 's call it a deal .
if that 's the case there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
if i go to the gym i 'll tell you the truth .
how much does it cost ?
what 's special about it ?
i think the main idea of pollution is much more important than the others .
of course . we can live together if you like .
i 'll try my best .
how about the quality ?
what 's the quality of these things ?
i worked in a fashion shop as a sales manager .
here 's a list .
i m sorry . i can t do that .
certainly .
that 's the same . let 's start with the bath .
ok .
he did n't know ?
what did he say ?
are you sure ?
how s working with him ?
i hope so .
but i still think so .
is there any furniture in it ?
it 's our pleasure . as you know i 'll have a definite answer i promise .
thanks a lot . i will try my best to do my best to promote the transaction .
possibly .
we have some interested in that field .
really ? i hope so .
to be honest i ca n't agree with you .
have you thought about it ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i feel the most important thing .
well what about the olympics ?
yes .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
i 'm sorry but i ordered sole not the same as the others . will you change it ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
sure i would .
what is the problem ?
i asked for a nonsmoking room and i do n't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i ca n't stand it . could you change my room please ?
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
that 's good . how can i pay for it ?
i know what you mean . surely they are playing now .
yes .
i see .
i 'd like to be positioned in the future .
i can help you with that .
i would like to help you .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness <unk> . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set <unk> . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because i would like to have a guide .
me too .
of course . i 'm just going to be a minute .
where did you learn it ?
sometimes it 's good sometimes it 's bad . you have to like the furniture .
high ?
yes . if you do n't mind me asking .
certainly . let me know when you are free .
i really appreciate your help .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
i will send them to you as soon as possible .
one thousand dollars per month .
why do you choose our company ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
of course .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
yes . we offer various kinds of benefits .
how about this product ?
you can start next monday .
when do i get a fair salary ?
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
it certainly is . thanks a lot .
sure . what do you have in mind ?
we are here to help . what are you looking for ?
that 's the most important thing .
is there a problem ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
could you deliver it tomorrow ?
no problem .
your flight takes off at
i can send it to you right now .
i see . thanks a lot .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
is there a problem ?
for a second ?
janice has just got sick and i need a hand now .
yes i know !
and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . for instance you used to sleep in every morning but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
mmmm . . . i m sure you can do that . i d be very glad to hear you .
we are not sure .
i m certainly not sure if your company has done a lot of work in the past . i wouldn t have plenty of work here .
i see .
my pleasure !
i could n't agree more .
yes i m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project .
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it certainly is . thank you for your help .
i can tell you about that .
i ll read one of the newspaper .
good idea . i m looking forward to watching something .
that 's what you 're thinking . i 'll let you know .
that s a good idea .
what else is that ?
how do you find them ?
like this one ?
it sounds like a good idea to me .
tired and stressed . this wedding is giving me a headache .
is that true ?
why is that ?
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
they 're all handmade . let 's see what we have in mind .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm not really interested in it .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today .
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what is that ?
ok .
can you tell me about it ?
what if there is that ?
i think the idea of it .
does that make any difference ?
no we 're not .
you are right . we should never be able to grow more than gold .
by the way what is it ?
is that all ?
no problem . i 'll do the same .
have you ever been there before ?
it 's about yuan .
it sounds a very depressing film .
it 's please .
what are we going to do for the party ?
how much do you want to have ?
thank you for your help .
get some snack foods .
here it is .
it 's in the cabinet too .
it was wonderful .
that 's true . what are you doing in the olympics ?
i 've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team 's equipment then a rally for cancer research and a connection to the innercity education program .
they are n't as lucky as we did .
yeah you are right .
when ?
ok .
oh that 's too bad . you can really appreciate it .
great !
i 've met some of my colleagues already . i m sure we ll get on well together .
well take it easy . it depends on your aim .
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

let 's think about it !
it 's very good . i think i 'll take it .
what are you in the mood for ?
i guess so .
i did n't see it .
ok . you have stayed for four nights at us dollars each and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . that makes a total of us dollars .
then you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it 's very inauspicious and might enrage all present .
the <unk> park in front of us .
i had no idea where you were .
here is the thing .
is it the chinese restaurant ?
let me see the notice . you can get one here .
thanks a lot . this one is here .

my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .

i know .
i don t know . i think he s a good idea .
are you serious ?
it 's a deal .
i 'm not sure . let 's go to the seafood restaurant again .
oh he 's and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
but i 'm not sure .
what ?
really ?
no they do but that 's true .
how about the performance these days ?
well what exactly does it mean ?
what do you recommend then ?
i certainly did .
well that 's nice you . i bet he would do it again . do you want to call the office ?

oh you mean i ? i 've never heard of this sort of thing .
oh how can i do that ?
cool ! what 's the problem ?
what do you recommend then ?
sure . i 'd like to make sure .
yes .
is he right ?
yes . when will he be back ?
yes i would .
he should be back in about forty minutes .
i understand . maybe you can call the police if you need any help .
what 's the matter with you ?
what 's the date today ?
who were they ?
i am sure you can do that .
of course i could .
it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
great .
how do you feel about hiring that <unk> to come and entertain the kids ?
afternoon please if that 's possible .

that 's great .
excuse me . i wonder see dean mr . lee first . i was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?

richard is not in a meeting yet .

are you sure ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
yes we have . i hope you can have a nice view of the city .
that 's the second bus .
that s right .
jen is there someone 's worth the game ?
i think that many physicians now agree with that idea .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
i 'll have it right away .
pretty is she ?
yes but i agree with you .
yes please .
but i know how to use them .
can you do anything else for me ?

yes i am .
i 'm sorry to hear that . are you a new card ?
hello ?
we 're ready to order . a cup of coffee for me and a glass of oranges for her .
oh yes i remember . but you must have been in the wrong direction .
but you should have aced it . . .
have you checked your wallet ?
we 're all going to show you around .
i 'm not sure .
thank you very much .
do you think so ?
what 's the problem ?
hmm . . .
no . i did n't have enough .
what 's wrong ?
no i did n't .
here you are sir .
i 'm sorry .
maybe another time .
ok i will . let 's go and have a look .
yes .
then i can do it right now .
okay . i 'll call you later .
why not ?
what 's the problem ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
it is so heavy .
no i did it .
but it is hard to get used to it .
no mine is n't it ?
calm down !
but you were in love with me .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
i see .
he 's really outrageous ! i think he 's a weirdo .
did you see the suspect ?
did you catch the news this morning ?
that 's a good idea . you know i hate cell phones .
no not really . i 'm thinking of doing it .
we 'd better get started .
how did you do that ?
do you accept check ?
when the lower branches are removed you ll be able to sit under the tree .
yes i do .
how about this one ?
i do n't know . i went there in a few years .
ebay also offers free insurance . you can get close to it .
what do you mean ?
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are you and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the <unk> centre of the <unk> faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
hmm . . . and it seems that there is something wrong with it .
are you serious ?
nope . it sounds easy .
i was told by a man . it must be very good .
i couldn t agree with you more .
where do we sell them ?
i do n't know what he wants to say .
you can say that again .
i am not feeling well .
oh i 'm a little busy these days .
fine . how are you ?
do you have any plans ?
i really want to go to a movie theater with my friends .
i won t be able to pay cash these months .
no . it was one of the best ones in my life .
i m so jealous . it won t be long .
yes i did .
so what do you mean ?
i guess so .
when can i get it ?
then your resume should be completed on thursday .
congratulations .
you can bring them back to me .
i know . what if i find a job that i know will take it .
if you want to post all of their money they can save you .
i wouldn t do that .
no !
yes you will need to pay a deposit .
when can i get the job ?
it 's a letter from nyu .
will i be able to do the job ?
generally the letter should be written by howard sounds .
i know . thank you .
the lab is on the first floor .
i will do that .
the main job is to compile and analyze information to prepare entries to accounts .
do you know where it is ?
no we have n't taken it yet . but the time will be transferred into a business trip .
how long is it going to take ?
i will . thank you very much .
certainly .
i see .
right .
thank you .
yes the machine is a little longer .
no . we can do that for you .
i need to report a breakin .
thanks a lot .
no i was in charge of the time .
how much money do you earn for it ?
yes but i doubt it .
i see . but this job is more important than it .
oh okay . thanks a lot .
that s right .
did you know that ?
i will try my best .
i see what the problem is .
really ?
sure .
i see . sorry about that .
good . the cable is over there .
i see .
you should still call the police .
no problem .
ask away .
thanks a lot !
i learned to be patient when i was in charge of my bank .
how do you know about that ?
several weeks ago .
why not ?

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
you re right . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of <unk> and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce <unk> . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
