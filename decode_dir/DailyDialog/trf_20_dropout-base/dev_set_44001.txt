about three times a week if i can .
i would like to transfer money .

what did you want to get ?
yes they have .
it feels good .
thank you very much .
the end of this month .
now that 's still a little bit tight .
yes . it 's necessary for you to leave .
well in order to get a refund in this magazine .
i am looking for some earrings for my wife and daughter .
and you can get some photos of your store .
no . it s not very elegant .
sure . cantonese food is lighter while shandong food is heavier and spicy .
sure . how about your size ?
oh it 's the same size .
ok . give me your address .
what 's the price ?
oh . thank you . excuse me . can you help me a more ?
certainly . here is the model .
the elevator is in the second floor . turn right there .
how much is the ticket ?
i 've also brought some chocolate .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
with this one ?
coffee only black coffee
will that be all ?
i will take it .
i do n't think so . i need a few more help .
what 's the rate for the room ?
i would n't mind a necklace . i was at the jewelry shop looking around and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces i want .
that sounds like a good idea .
yes please . oh no a cup of hot chocolate will be fine .
how would you like your coffee ?
yes . it s so nice of you .
i ll clean the table first .
yes . but we charge a commission of the service .
could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?
no problem .
then what 's my number ?
it s by the middle of the road .
when ?
okay . have you got a coke ?
i feel like champagne .
what do you want ?
could i reserve a table by those ?
may i have a room please ?
what brand ?
those .
yes . could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in germany ?
how about this one ? it 's a specialty of the latest fashion .
and why do n't you send a letter of recommendation ?
well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
here you are . thank you very much .
thank you .
well i 'd like to look at the <unk> side of the town .
so how ?
i ca n't do that . it 's only a picture of your father .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
did i mess up on anything ?
why not ?
great . i 'll let you know when i get my hair done and here .
hi .
okay . what name did you want ?
here is your ticket and your key number . the bellboy will pick you up your luggage at noon . have a nice evening .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
all right . can i see anything else ?
you re not going to get a refund on the rent right now .
if i get the apartment out of this would it be possible .
i am afraid we ca n't . cash only .
ok . here is your receipt .
i 'm sorry sir . the gym is on the bathroom .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place a phone call to paris .
sure . though we are a little light we do not have many choices . on our hands i do n't know anything about his ties .
how many nights a week is it ?
it costs ten cents a copy .
how long have you been to live here ?
well it 's our pleasure . what kinds of postal savings account do you want ?
did i mess up on anything ?
why not ?
where are you planning to go to ?
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .

i like miniskirt .
well . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .

that 's a special gift . they were hoping to see that they were a better email . i know how they they sell you and they all my wife . but they ve telephone them for me to see if you .
i d suggest you go and buy a bottle of beer . everything is going out there and i d love to get a good one .
ok . there is a good one just around the corner . can we do it at the shopping center ?
i 'm sure you can pass it .

don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
and you can never be seen at that village .
i 'm very sorry sir but you must take a wrong turn . what can i do for you ?

i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of the friends .

i bought it for three hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen 's boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .

they spend hours there especially on weekends .
sure . here 's a good school report at the shopping center and the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . let me see . . . yes that 's the best discount i can do .

do you want to go with me ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
i told you we 'd just have to go .

very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
how long does it take ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
it 's like cif .

people are quarrelling .
yeah .

i will go there if you like .
exactly .
the traffic is much worse than by the city .
how come ?
where are you going to find your bedroom set ?
i like living in the mountains .
it took me a long time .
ok . i will send it to you as soon as possible .
you ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent right now .
what 's the problem ?
yes it has a big house . is it on the th floor ?
ok . i don t know how much it will be .

wangfujing please !
it 's on the second floor .
i have to be there before o 'clock .
what else are you planning to see ?
that 's too bad .
i 'm sorry . i 'll do it tomorrow .
here 's twenty dollars .
oh . i 've only got yuan .
oh i see .
thank you very much . sir
yes i do .
where are you going ?
two blocks down the road please .
ok . could you please go to the airport ?
i 'm going to bed if you do n't have any then i think you 're ready .
nothing . but we do n't have to worry about it .
what 's the cost of euro ?
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
what do you do there ?
can we get there in half an hour ?
but you certainly didn t get accepted .
i want to get there before ten . can i get my hair done ?
hi daddy . it s me troy .
sure . what would you like to drink ?
wow . it 's much bigger than the others . do you have a bigger one ?
yes i am . what about you ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
sure . i 'd love to . .
that 's ok . see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the office at that time .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! our rental agent has a very good reputation in the village . i think you have a balcony that is very reliable . the one with our jinyuan apartments . the other floor has a few floor so it is very economical . you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't have visitors .
what would it be ok to look at the room ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
that 's a little bit more than i expected .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the rent .
i thought you had an idea . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . but i will think it 's a good idea .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you know he is so successful now .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
i went to school for each class when i was at school . so i am much more clever than you .
hi lee .
hi linda . what 's up ?
no i 'm not sure where it was . the weather was lousy and you did n't call the police .
i 'm fine thanks .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh good . have you got a promotion ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
i have worked in the it department every year . in my opinion you have worked for this company as an assistant since you are currently studying in university . if you are free i can do many things for you .
thank you very much !
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
i have n't seen them .
it 's very nice .
what is she ?
i 'm sorry . the one who saved the better .
that 's not a bad idea . i 'd better not do that . it 's probably just that he got the boxes to do . probably it 's to be his fault .
what 's the time ?
see you .
i see .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a few days in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
leave me your address please .
what s wrong with the broken ?
okay . i m ready ! you can t wait !
which side of the car is it ?
ok ! i ve always been looking forward to watching how you like it .
what do you know ? why do n't we get so many clothes ?
i ve never had one before . i told you that i was thinking of going to stick to it up a bit .
what are you doing ?
i 'm looking for a sweater .
what color are you looking for ?
i think i ll need a polaroid . does this mm camera have a picture of leather store ?
sure ! and you have to put all your camera on the scales so you can see the picture of your camera .
i see . if you could give me a few more details i would like to see the photos of the photos .
sure . it 's a bag of sugar .
i heard it 's a little bit conservative .
so you ve got a lot of makeup then .
yeah the sun shines day after day . it 's really nice for night and enjoys listening to night instead of swimming .
why not ? i d like to buy one .
what 's that ?
how d you want to get it ?
what 's it look like lady ?
thank you . this is the latest fashion for me .
the internet 's a lot worse .
there s a supermarket right there .
i am afraid i could n't do anything . what would you do for me ?
this is paula blake mr . simmons . how can i help you ?
i 'd like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no that 's all .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
very good .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . the dozen red roses are the latest and i bought them .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something to drink .
what s the matter ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . the market is too expensive .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i will get it . how much do i need ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk .
i have no idea what you are talking about . if i have no idea what the computer will be and if it s good to be !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in the strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i 'm going to get a new house .
of course . the first is the cheapest here but the offer is a little lower . the cheapest with our offer is a month which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of coffee and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
yes you are lucky ! and this is a new cell phone . i promise you this is not what you want and i want .
awesome !
i am an idiot . .
what s the problem ?
alright . you can pick up your eyes now .
i really thought it was a nice little quiet . did you know what she looks like ?
what would you like to do with your <unk> ?
it 's on sale this year .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks good . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there . let me see . . a white hat is now . it 's a very beautiful colour .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too .
don t worry . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come to the second time . it s such a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you .
you re welcome .
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
as long as you don t buy it we will need to complete the money .
it s this year .
we will give you a discount .
i will cancel it for you .
how about going to a theatre ?
i went to yale university and i eat a lot more .
if you like i m afraid that i can t go to the theatre .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy it ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . the ingredients are over there . the last thing i m not sure you can find them which is the ingredients . the ingredients are usually the ingredients . the ingredients are the can not the same as in which is the world .
yeah i 'm sure it 's the same as doing it 's a great deal . i 'd like to have a try .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it 's a great idea for me to cook and leave my wife until the birthday .
certainly sir . what kind of shirts do you like ?
which one is it ?
single please . that 's what i want . can i try it on ?
it 's only about forty dollars .
i can t believe it . by the way do you want to get a discount ?
that s great . let s go !
i like the pointed toes . let s get them look at . i need your coat . see . we ll take this outfit to the other .
i am not sure . what color do you have ?
ok here you are .
i want a formal suit .
thanks i can t believe it .
ok . i m going to the rock and roll .
i am sorry . he is busy now . can i take a message ?
i was told to come over to see if the problem is fixed . i was coming to see about it .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i want to be a fit in and challenging apartment .
yes it 's very nice of you to have an apartment with us .
good . i will come to pick you up at eight .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i 'm ready to place where you want to go .
i do n't care . it looks a little wrong with you .
should i bring anything with me ?
no . everything will be ready when you come to see your id and everything will be ready .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes ? what 's the price of this one ?
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes that 's what i want .
could you come down and see what the interior looks like ?
how about a here at the corner of the paying center of the gas ?
are you sure ?
that 's great . let 's help .
wow ! it s quite large . and there are two bedrooms a dining room and a kitchen .
it 's a big building so i can get a storage room .
maybe you will find the price of suite . the price is rather light .
oh we have a big house of all .
what about making a decision ?
how can that be ?
how much more ?
how long does it take ?
it 's a cold . can i put it in a proper place ?
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
yeah . i think we can finish it .
all right . there is a room for you right now .
it s my perfume .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hi bob . what can i do for you ?
ok can you go see it ?
i love apartment . you got a great view .
i will begin to look at the job that is more likely in the first .
yes . i have to go back .
i have it monday .
i 'll see with you in front of me . see you then .
what 's your address ?
that 's great . i need to get my visa .
you will need to bring some id to check your passport .
i 'd like to buy a pair of shoes .
well you can get started . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a discount .
well first you have to make sure that you want a computer . here is a system for computer .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we should tell you about your hardware first . if you buy one of these fifteeninch color
well i 'll have a virus .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple computer . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
that sounds great . i will take one .
are you interested in a fulltime or parttime ?
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and that . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are they ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry . i do n't think i should ask some of my friends .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok . i see .
yes he knows i 'm coming .
sure . what should i do ?
she 'll take it .
ok . please wait a minute . i can take your hair .
it 's a little too plain . will you cut the perm ?
oh i see . thank you .
i feel the same way . i am not sure about the color . i feel attractive and style .
the same .
yes please .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that s easy . anything else ?
what do you think is the same enough .
what should i do ?
do you want to know what kind of food it is ?
yes if it 's a pity .
yes . we export it for about eight times .
the really thing is that you can recommend a mac with you .
oh i see . i 'll have it wrapped for you .
i think you 're right .
you 're right . but you 'd better stay at home for a while .
what 's that ?
all right . let me check it out .
we could check out the price .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
we can do that .
yes you know we do . the refrigerator is very good . and we do n't have a lot of problems .
how about once a week ?
all right . let me check out the parties .
how long until you get the house in the city you will find the best house for you .
we can check out the house and place is a separate refrigerator .
and you can get a sale on the market . they 've got character .
yes but we can check out the house .
i have n't had any luck in them .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
all right . let me check it out .
no it 's easy . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s easy to make some sense . and we also have a lot of coffee .
actually if you can go to the bus stop in the next block you can take no .
yeah . i just got a couple of tickets to friday .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about some burgers ?
i prefer sea food .
i like spicy food . can i try some ?
yes . the food was excellent but not in the past .
what were you going to do ?
i like winner 's of of it .
would you like some rice ?
no i do n't know . but i know in chinese food is very good for me .
why not have them and yet ?
thanks . i 'll try my best to give me some advice .
yeah i know if they 're still available . however if i think they might be able to enjoy something else .
you need n't do that .
hmm . . . can you make yourself some chinese food ?
sure . where do you want me to go ?
well i was just hoping we could get together with the l c . i think i need to get some advice .
i know . i know . but the stereo store is so important . i don t have them to put them on the net .
ok . i know . but they are already busy .
of course .
alright . i must have an o 'clock . do i have to work now ?
here you are . you must return them within a month .
it 's really a big problem .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
what 's the difference between these products ?
we need to know your name address and phone number .
all right . they 'll go .
they are here .
can you tell me how much i can get ?
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
i can fix the shop at the shop .
yes i know . i have a good idea . what do you need ?
what 's more there 's a lot of girls in your mind .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i was thinking about buying some summer clothes . the only reason is that i don t have to pay for my own bills .
that s the nine facial charm . i was born in .
i want one more question . do you like yours ?
the library is free .
i will go to the supermarket this weekend .
get here . you can get rid of them .
yes i would like to check in .
do you have that in black or will those plain pattern in the black ?
yes i have it right here .
good . i have a question . what do you think of it ?
i guess i can use them .
yeah . and go to the supermarket too .
do i have a black ink too ?
what were you going to get ?
well in that case i will take it .
you are really interested in the position that you have to pay for the package .
well i guess i can put my car on the scales so i can replace them .
i 'm sure i 'll take that of those of my ties . do you have a picture of those skirts in the black or tan ?
well i can understand that .
i 'm afraid i ca n't help you . my baggage are a <unk> . here is the money .
here you are .
thank you . what 's the rate for a double room for one night ?
no problem . i have to go to the store to buy some chocolate .
thanks . i 'm glad to help .
sure what 's it ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is there a wait for a few minutes ?
anything else ?
where s that ?
it 's the end of the world ! they 're really weird .
i also think that the food is a little too slow for me . do n't you know what i should do ?
what do you mean with it ? can you still use it or get all the money ?
okay ! i took the first place ! what are you going to get ?
how about some poor dogs ?
oh look at the <unk> cup . they are delicious .
oh good . well what about your parents ?
yes i did . but now i need to go to the olympic restaurant .
yes i do . i like it very much . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends . do you like cooking ?
that s great ! that s it ! you know i ve been thinking about it !
i usually use a few times a week if i m employed then .
ok good idea ! i am ready for a start !
hey shop ! i 've always loved frozen pizza .
that s a great idea . you should also cook dinner .
well i always use hot dishes to cook dishes for the children .
haha i suppose you 're right . it 's a healthy treat .
not really . there are places that are pounds in each frame of mind .
that 's a great idea . what 's a waste of time
i like spicy food too .

first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .

that needs to be cut into thin strips about cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !

i 've got to drive to the gym every day .

yes . it is wonderful to have the ancient olympics .
my bad but at least i know the right bus to take my phone .
why do n't we go there by bike ?

i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree . it 's just convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !

and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they will be there in the mail .
that 's right . you are not gonna catch any attention in the lake .
no it is n't .
oh i know .
hum me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?
nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .
what about ?
i 'm not too clear on some things about my lease .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i hope to be a teacher .
i m not sure you re right . well i think you are right there is always some important problems .
what do you think about the position ?
maybe we should find out if we have a different history of more than ten people .
what ?
well i think you re right on the wrong line . i ll be back to help with the extension .
what ? what if i said is it ?
that s true . what do you do when the party should we do ?
i think i m ready to learn a lot from this one .
but it sounds like you 're such a good mom .
i m fine . thank you .
no problem . so how have you been ?
i would like to return this book .
i would like to help you with this picture . what do you need me to help you with ?
i need to make a withdrawal .
did you check the periodicals ?
no i didn t .
i ll just have to write you a ticket .
do you have anything to declare ?
i know and i want to ask you what is best for you .
thank you very much .
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how the person got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the world is bigger than the super bowl of bell captain .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only a large space at the top .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it says it is a perfect cube . look at the sign of the name .
is there anything wrong with it ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada and the usa are huge too .
there are many famous buildings in the world too .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to transfer money .
is that all ?
i have it right here .
will you need anything else ?
what do i do ?
yes i am sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if you ask me i can help you with it .

well . i got a raise in the long time . in fact i have n't received a lot of money in the school yet .
he is finishing up the past twelve dollars .
i 'm not sure if i 'm not sure nobody will be our own .

you think she s going to be a great friend ?
i appreciate you helping me with this .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that 's okay .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i do n't think she will .
i can see the doctor .
well . you can do more rest .
but i like its color .
when can you buy it ?
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
my parents gave me a speech in english class and i have n't had a chance to make my best .
i think it 's the same for a film .
but he s such a drag .
maybe i can sleep more .
i m not crazy about it . you know he could win the first two everybody in life .
are you serious ? can you tell me how i can have some time to buy some fruit ?
oh yes . train no . and there s a big one here .
i m glad you re going to get something to eat .
well you ve got a lot of plans . thank you for your help .
so what s the train where you re going ?
this is great news . how long have you been working here for years ?
that 's a good idea . his father is a mayor . she wants to study and quit while she wants to study abroad .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
well they have to go to a hospital and make sure they will have a good time .
anything else can i do for you ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
well you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you 're all the same .
wow ! that 's great !
are you kidding ? what are you talking about ?
sounds like a soccer fan .
the cops show up in a few hours .
where are we ?
i am sorry . what 's wrong ?
oh i 'm sorry .
you said it s a lovely day .
no i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
yes i did . it was in a shop near the mall .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
why ? what 's wrong ?
but they 're not expensive .
it seems you 're right . and the next one .
i see . it 's very nice of you to say so .
what 's special about that ?
what happened ?
can you talk about your mother ?
i see .
but you should have told me that you had to stay in your car with friends .
i do n't like the way . i just stayed a minute and have to wait for the next dance .
all right . over here sir . how are you today ?
it 's a small world . i guess i am happy .
oh come on ! look at it ! it 's beautiful .
she 's my wife 's boyfriend .
what 's her last name ?
i was so nervous . i kept telling you that i was in a movie .
really ? what did you do in your class ?
she 's very nice .
then she 's so cute .
i feel sorry for her .
when she 's young is tall .
she was a psycho man .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
they are . i 'm just glad he does n't .
sorry that 's too late . i 'll have someone check for you .
maybe it is n't . it 's better to be late .
i understand . maybe he could do something .
what 's it look like ? it 's the sales line i 'm standing in is n't it ?
and if he wants to lose any more you 'd like to give him a hand .
you strange it sir . it 's to tell you the truth i am on the phone .
well they are probably going to have to wait for the next meeting .
oh then what were they ? they 've got character .
it 's difficult to bring with me .
yes . i was in a hurry . and my mother just broke up with me .
yes that 's right . but the first meeting was changed so i have to wait for the next meeting and say good things .
i did n't know . but things are just too different .
yes i 've sent it to you .
i 've got one . let 's ask her to get out of the life .
me too .
i know . i have n't done that before .
let 's play a game for a few days .
i know but he 's so cute .
you know what ? i did n't mean .
but he ca n't do that zina .
what ?
yeah ! i 'm pretty sure about it .
all right . you 're back . your room number is .
jane i have n't seen you for ages .
the meeting will be held on it . do you want to go with me ?
my mother said she had a hospital in an hour .
how long have you been there ?
did you know that all these memories of prom night ?
i know . well what happened ?
yes and they did .
cool ! i 'll ask him .
i did n't know you 'd be a lot of trouble with them .
thanks a lot . so how much is it ?
but i 'm not sure .
please wake me up at am .
i hope you will recover soon .
yes i have . the contract says it 's a long time .
that 's pretty good .
i said you were in love . what 's he like ?
should we go buy something ?
actually if you do n't have one now you 'll have to use a phone .
you 've got a very good voice ! a very strong smoke and those three times over there 's a piece of cake .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
oh i did n't think about it . how did they get that ?
they 're a nice pair . how much are they ?
uh . . . no more than the doctor .
do n't be silly . but i 'm afraid it will be too late .
well i hope it does n't matter . thank you .
yes very much .
what 's going on ?
yes . how do you want it ?
when did you arrive here ?
what was the only one ?
you re re absolutely right . i 'm sorry .
i could n't wait anymore . i could use my computer .
sure . here you are .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
i guess so . it 's a little hard to be true .
yes . each one is very nice . and it 's much bigger than the others .
that 's really a nice piece . can you read the characters ?
i 'm a podiatrist . what about you ?
are you still going to do this ?
i know . i could n't wait until the last minute .
no thank you .
do n't mention it .
yes but not including charges .
good morning . what 's the problem ?
good morning ! can you help me please ? i 'm looking for some books for my mother .
thank you . i 'm sure everything will be fine .
well i ve had to tell you that our products are very proud of you .
oh you did a job at the bank .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the room is on the fourth floor . just a few minutes ago .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there anything else i can do ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
they 're blue .
how old is she ?
she 's .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't know what to do !
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of the friends .
that 's great . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can ask them to play tennis together .
sounds great . let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
but you have to wait a minute .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
that 's great ! i 'll let you go .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise i 'll do it for you .
i do n't want to .
well why do n't you ?
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will . but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is everything in the morning ?
what are you doing now ?
i just stayed at home and watched tv .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's it like ?
of course . what 's up ?
i would like to open a new account .
that 's all right .
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely .
ok i am sorry to hear that .
no thank you . i 'm just looking for your call .
i 'm glad you like it . i do n't think i 'll like it .
what 's the charge for it ?
this one ? how about this one ? it 's a french medium .
it sounds great .
my pleasure .
ok . thank you .
ok . anything else ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
actually you have n't had much .
coffee please .
have you bought it in a small shop ?
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
no . ok .
sure . you can have a receipt of your bank . the tax in cash is included .
it 's the same size as the heavy color . but it 's quite large .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry about that .
oh i m so sorry .
but i couldn t make it .
oh i do n't know what to get to the food .
i am sorry to hear that . can you name a few days ?
do you want me to put this on the spot ?
what 's that ?
why don t we start looking at the bottom ?
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this is a really old car ! it has a very good broken rearview mirror on the left .
not sure yet . how about a hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and then put it back together again . you know what ?
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i am just not in the mood these days .
i m a little worried about my lease .
great . where are you from ?
yes . by the way what are these in some cases ?
i want to go to the top of the received .
what 's the matter with you ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
how long do you want to stay ?
that s fantastic ! you know how tight the ears are ?
excuse me miss . thanks for the trip .
my train will leave at i 'll have to drive to paris . it is very close to the hotel .
oh no do n't be so sure . i do n't have a partner .
how do you want to do ?
so what are you gonna quit ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as your company you can t receive the company .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece . no man !
i 'm having a great time .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
so i m sorry for that .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes .
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? i ve always been making one !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy the game !
that s my greatest concern . who is it ?
the same to you !
i m sorry . i ve got too many of my makeup .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it off the world .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
let s do it ! that s a good idea ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
you are my best friend . that s my mom .
of course ! well i have to focus my eyes on her . and all the other girls are so fat .
well i think the most important thing is that you need to put the job .
are you feeling any good ?
i think you look a little light of getting a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you 're right . i feel like you tonight .
are you kidding me ?
but you should make up like a good impression .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
i see you are making your sense of humor . there s a lot of picture of a sudden !
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
i m leaving . you re unbearable you can walk home i ll walk home .
where are you going ?
i m going to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
how about afternoon ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
well i think you deserve a wonderful job .
i 'm glad to hear that .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
no not yet . i 'm still in the movie . it 's a mystery novel .

i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
and then why did n't they drive ?
i told him . he was a taxi driver .
it 's really worth it .
it does n't matter .
what did you want me to do ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .

i did n't know .
i remember she 's very serious . what did you do ?

you said it . no one can match shakespeare in other cultural field .
i do n't really want to .
what 's the good idea ?
nothing really .

it is the money you owe .
that 's great . i hope we can have a picnic .
what else would you like ?
remember that you already have a car on the top floor .

i am ready to let you know that i need to get a new loan .
if you need to . and we can do that for you . if you need to go to the post office and get the money right apartment for the course .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
that 's great . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
what a pity .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
are you kidding me ?
but the snowmaking may cause you too much trouble .
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we 've got a spot in olympic stadium .
i hope you have a good time .
thanks . i have been proud of myself .
who won ?
well that 's not all ! so you two are at least an hour to go .
that s great .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
then i must be very tired .
i usually only use my clothes online .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
i wish i could help you .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
you are welcome .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm not thirsty .
oh . i 'm afraid the time is bad . what time does the flight get to rome ?
look i ca n't prove that .
i will replace them .
oh no . i 'm sorry . but to begin the job . can i get a new position to open the job ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
i thought it was a better game .
no thanks .
really ? what did she do ?
no .
it 's great . what did you do there ?
we 've got to get off at the bus stop and try again .
are you applying for a visa ?
that 's right .
i think you should give it a shot .
no . please feel free .
what 's the matter ?
i do n't think so .
nice to meet you too .
i love rumba and waltz .
dance and talent are the same for me .
no i do n't like the foxtrot and waltz .
no i do n't like modern dance . i 'm absolutely full of modern dances all .
yes . but the certainly music can be the greatest dance .
what 's the matter with these beautiful quilt ?
well . . . i can see that all over the world .
yes it is . the top of the world is a great ancient chinese world .
but i do n't know both the same .
they are reasonable and reasonable . in the meantime i think it 's quite a sheer waste of time to protect myself .
yeah . do i need to focus my laptop from my laptop ?
we can do either call them this way .
they 're something up to the high school now !
it was wonderful .
yes . i like collecting antiques .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
great . i like the dance floor .
now let 's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards .
thank you . i 'll have a taste of music . can you sing the music now ?
so what 's your favorite dance ?
yes i 'd love to .
oh you dance beautifully too .
to a disco ?
what 's a great dance ?
very well . how about a rumba ?
let me take a look . i 'm so sorry .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
certainly ! but i 'm a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
i guess you can get a loan from your service .
oh well the music has stopped .
it says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . it might be the most terrible thing for you .
but i do n't know whether i can recover from it .
yes it 's the same medicine .
oh well the dance has stopped .
those are a good breakfast .
what a good idea .
oh the music has stopped . thank you .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
thanks . i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
oh do you enjoy the waltz ?
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
what do you want to live swimming ?
not a bit . but the price is reasonable .
hmm . . if i do n't drink any more than a racket i prefer a heavy seat or even on the tv .
absolutely . take my time .
what are your favorite animal of red wine ?
yeah . the weather here is often cold and it 's a little warm .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea . after we finish it the mess of the gas you can just use it .
let 's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
thank you .
i really think the sun is too hot . have you remember the vegetables we came for a picnic right ?
i like summer too . i ca n't wait to get it when i was autumn .
yes it is . but i 'm going to be coming soon .
i like autumn too . where i was born in beijing . the weather is very cold in autumn and autumn is the best time of year .
i like summer too .
well . two more warm seats . the area is next to the stairs .
i like the song .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
what 's that ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love the snow ! it 's so exciting .
is it cold in winter ?
i 'll have a dry dry and dry my skin will make it feel very fresh .
that 's right . not all my families are warm .
that 's right . this is the first day i have in america .
i really like your lips .
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
if i have time i will come again .
it was a pleasure .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
is that you janice ? just speaking .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
i 'll be there in a few minutes .
thank you .
so you can see me then .
yes . why ?
i am glad you can come .
i 'd love to .
please get me the ticket .
do you have a club card for me ?
i was robbed this morning .
ok i 'll leave the message .
no problem . good luck bye !
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i ca n't log on the internet again .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
i have a driver 's license and two years of driving experience .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
oh maybe you can give me a definite answer . i d like to go for a ride in the neighborhood and see it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's he doing ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
do n't mention it . it 's my pleasure .
no problem at all . you 'll find our prices very favorable . you will find our price is very favorable . you will see the insurance policy .
i 'd love to . where is it ?
i 've had a good time .
he 's after you asked him whether you were admitted to a doctor or something .
yes i do .
i am sorry he is really in trouble .
i am not so sure .
well you can keep the ones i ll take it . now the stir fry my wife would kill them . . .
i have to meet you at the first sight .
i 'm afraid i can . i 'm not in the mood for it .
that 's all right . try to be natural .
well what time ?
that 's all right . i 'm really sorry .
what did you say ?
they re my little kids . they re the groom s niece and nephew .
i 'll bet you had a wonderful time .
yes i have two brothers who are in the states .
hi ! i m going to need some more info about your pin services .
no problem . what can i do for you ?
you 're welcome .
you 're welcome . goodbye .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
no problem .
you 'll be pretty confident . but how long have you been in love with her ?
but you are right .
yeah . but she 's so pretty .
well i think you should give her some advice . what would you think of her ?
you can always do it !
i 'd love to see it 's looks like you were pretty picture of the month and that 's why it 's called the picture of the month .
oh my god that 's a long story .
right you re right . well you can ask her to give me a hand .
well your school is good for your health . and you do n't have to work much longer .
so what ?
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we have more room .
have you noticed the new product a has been introduced ?
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i watched it last week .
i 'm glad you did a good job .
i am sure i will enjoy the life .
ok . you are already trying now on your own .
ok . i 'll be careful .
sure . my name 's nick .
yes i did . there are fashion victims on the fashion .
it 's all started cooking .
interesting . so it seems like they had quite an adventurous childhood .
that 's right .
what 's the those ?
may i have the name and address ?
i do n't know . but i was thinking you could do it .
i know what you do is best for you . it is always important to you to get some rest .
that sounds like a good idea .
hey . i know . what 's the problem ?
the best way to go out is to be honest .
yes you are right .
and you 're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
i 've tried to give it a try .
stop producing cigarettes . you should try it .
yes . many times .
they are all up .
i thought they were all in finance .

do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

i ca n't wait to vote .
i have lived here for twenty years .

how many vegetables do we have ?
let 's see . are there any hot water coming ?
anything else ?
i 'm very busy right now . i 've been away on my apartment .
i have been to the doctor the other day .
i remember it 's been dating for over years .
i remember now . you must have changed everything .
i 've been working pretty hard .
what school did you take there ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but any employee who persists in using instant messaging will first receive a warning and provide personal use of technology .
yeah you are right . then i will try my best to find something that i do n't think about it .
hi ! how have you been ?
you 're welcome .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes i graduated from college as an intern in college .
i 'm glad we 're going to be able to help you with your new card .
fine . thanks .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
no thanks . i 'm just looking .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
here you go .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
the sky is clear the sun is shining . there is a nice cool breeze so it does n't rain .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i do n't like walking in the countryside . i like being in the downtown area .
well . i won t go anywhere ! i tell you i won t do it .
have a lot of water .
she 's a pretty beautiful movie .
she married too .
tom that lucky guy .
oh he is all right . but busy as usual .
yeah . he s been such a hard time .
she is doing fine .
oh she s so pretty .
he 's in the hospital with a great mood .
oh a girl . you can see him on the breath .
well control is really using common sense when you plan to control your eating habits .
of course not . his wife is very good . i 'm not sure he did .
he does n't say that . his father 's very tall and he can be sure to be able to finish it now .
did you see the officer ?
you can see a lot of films do n't you ?
she is a great mother .
yes she is .
you know i have to say so . it 's not a good idea to say .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
are you sure ?
my hair looks hideous .
you were too strict .
how dare you not drive ?
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
but it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . but i 'm not sure he has had one to .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i told him that i 'm terribly sorry .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself is a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
he 's an excellent record of directors .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . she 's getting dark .
i like him . he s good for her .
i know you 're so thoughtful .
all right .
what was the score ?
thank you .
well the best way we 'll be happy to learn is to be in a different way .
he did n't know that . but he had to be too critical .
well . here is the address .
why ?
can you tell me something about it ?
here is the gift for you . do you need anything else ?
it was on sale a week .
that sounds terrible . you can rest up and rest .
i didn t know that .
i see . but it seems we can expect everything from a different world .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
sounds like you need to be late .
yeah it s a pretty women . they will keep one contact with the women and wife and wife .
that 's interesting . you have to teach him how to do it .
and the first year of our marriage we have great difficulties . it seems that they will never be suitable for us to get married young people .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you 're all the same .
i tell you off .
oh does he often beat you ?
he 's a nasty cold . i 'll give you a chance .
it seems that the only thing is we should do is to have a word with you .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then it must be several excellent words .
i have a lot of friends .
i wish you were interested in them .
sure . we have a lot of light blue eyes and i like the back .
but many people are good for them . you can follow the good friends and go to the same time .
really ? you are one of my favourite customers . i am willing to give you a call .
what 's wrong with her ?
well that s for sure . we have to find vince now .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? what are you going to do now ?
hey ! how about you ?
i could help you with that .
there are four people .
how many years have you lived there ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! how old is your brother ?
that 's true . but the competition is very bad .
that 's an excellent point . there are a lot of issues you know .
i think families are often more independent than having a small children .
i hope your cat finds its way .
yes we do . everyone in our office is very friendly .
i bet he is that guy . it must be tough !
thanks . my wife and i are very happy to hear this .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my <unk> birthday .
maybe next week .
that will be fine .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .

no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .

i see . it seems like such a father is a boy .
but that 's not the reason for the delay .
my parents .
what were you talking about ?
what do you think i should do ?
she is expecting .
that s my immediate opinion .
what kind of things do you want ?
why do n't we call them ?
you did ? that is great !
yeah i 've been invited to the party for more than two years . and i also doubt if i could use your bike .
no i am free i will be there what time ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about thirty .
got it .
i must know what happened .
what symptoms does she have ?
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . the time will be over .
yeah he should be more careful .
i think it s something about the same . i also think that we should be a more active holiday in the united states .
that 's great ! your number is ca n't you live in the same place ?
he is a lawyer .
you must be careful . you need n't buy any kind of stuff .
what ?
sure . they re ok . don t put your name on your back then .
well . we re very sorry for this position .
oh . thank you .
she 'll be able to make it in the early thirties if you think everyone will be able to drink .
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
there was nothing like this .
but you know they re much better than this . because they are much better than my head .
what ?
i have no idea where to get it from .
have you taken your temperature ?
i m glad that you are a bit optimistic .
yes we are .
when will you be getting off ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh i like summer . it 's going to be great .
not bad . we 're not sure yet probably in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i see . you 're all set mr . armstrong . enjoy your flight !
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your parents a lot ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . could i have some trouble with my lunch ?
and how long is it going to take to get it ?
yes it is .
well we try some time . shall we have a glass of coffee ?
just fine . how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'd like to send this parcel please .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat the type of food you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat the type of food you eat .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
whatever you say .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you are happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me see . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be a grinding coffee grinder .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
i do n't know what kind of sports do you like best ?
what 's on ?
it was just a little things .
yes . i worked in a different town .
i 'm sorry . he 's not here right now . may i take a message ?
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?

that s fine . maybe next time . i ll be glad to get you off .
how much do you want to pay ?
yes it 's a great idea .
that s what i need . i m still playing the piano .
i think i am having a cold .
i hope you re a nice guy .
yes . i have been thinking of getting a better position .
i 'm going to give you a ride .
i 'm sorry to hear that . we have to leave a lot of the paperwork .
yeah so why not ?
no .
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
i have to but if you have any questions just let me know .
i understand . and what does it cost ?
yes . we also need to check your passport and the amount you can have .
but i need some information about my visa .
it has a strong feeling and a little less than .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you seen the company ?
no . i 've always been here for a few months . what 's it like ?
yes i 'd love to . what do you want to come ?
well that 's happens . but if you feel well you have n't been to a different one .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
well i have to teach you how to set them if they want me to be more comfortable . they can live on a date with my parents and my parents .
i know i need to live pretty but i 'm sure they get started . after a good time i 'll work for you and other things at the university i 'll need to help you study .
i 'm your wife . she 's eight .
how old is he ?
they did n't want you to live with us . we still have fun .
that sounds like a good family .
what a pity ! my child has the same thing .
well there 's a long list .
the other day i saw that it in the book of computer i was a member of the art .
i see . i will come and see you later .
yeah . my tv has a lot of tv shows and her boys .
how did it go ?
what are you going to go to university ?
what happened ?
yeah . he s been on a business trip with the local history of his girlfriend .
what a beautiful child !
what is he mainly then ?
oh i ve heard about that before . what else do you want to get ?
i know ! they re glad you know . maybe she s my favorite than the national women s birthday .
it s quite reasonable .
yes i 've kids a lot . i don t like to kids . my family always likes to kids .
oh yes they are really looking forward to it . did you find anything ?
well have you ever heard about our company ?
well what about your family ?
she is a nurse in a highschool she teaches chinese .
i 'd be glad to . but i bet she would be glad to be there .
how about taking a walk to have an evening together ? i feel it is about me .
but if it is n't my fault would you have to go to cram for me ?
i 'm still open to the public .
i m so glad to see you . i ve been out of town .
cool . you d better get a little exercise and sleep .
i ve been playing football with my parents for many years . and i haven t been in them for many years .
when did they leave ?
yes . i love you too .
no but i do n't think i 've .
yes you can still stay in a different world .
oh i like playing basketball .
i like playing games but i never play games when i was a child .
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
i like all kinds of sports and i have to be very good for direct and i 'm quite interested in it .
what kind of sports do you like ?
i used to dancing all the time . i used to use a gym but i never need one one girl to use them .
you ? i play badminton with him everyday .
i know .
but i can t stand a good singer .
well what are you going to do now ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
there s a great sitcom but you ve still started playing the world .
do n't be so pathetic .
there are many things forbidden activities .
are you going to get married ?
no i was n't feeling well .
the game i want to say about the game .
and your <unk> 's children has just one of those .
remember it is a double decker one . it s a blackout from the university of shanghai .
you really should n't be very careful next game . you know many girls play games like you play games with other girls .
what do you usually do when you finish it ?
which team are you going to ?
mm . you can play the piano very well .
basketball .
my parents are a bit too busy and sometimes i never played football . what do you do ?
i do n't think so . a working day is a nasty one . you 've got to be patient .
well you know i m not sure . as you know i should ask my mom .
i think it s all about that . one of the more that s for me to buy a film .
of course . i have to leave too .
i know one .
yeah . but you just have a stronger and you should also try to stay in bed .
i 've found a few openings in my field .
that s a good idea . but how can you stand working here ?
i thought a lot of people do that .
not really . but i still like having a big problem with my son .
no i don t have any . it s easy to keep a distance from the stress of the swimming pool .
i enjoy the exercise and i enjoy dancing .
good idea !

i do n't know . elvin is trying to be .
i do n't know . i 'm working hard to be a good team . i know i 'm starting to have a job with my boss .

i love you . and i think you re awesome .
what is this ? i ca n't see them .
what kind of flowers do you want ?
you said it . that 's what i thought . .
it 's true . but it 's a genius . she did a best job in the company .
i know . why not ?
i 'm all right thanks . how are you doing now ?
yes . and i 're <unk> sales figures up to eight .
you 're kidding ! and you 're going to be okay ?

may i know your name please ?
i 'm sorry to trouble you but i 'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
thank you . i hope you will have a great look at it .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
i 'll try my best . but when is it due ?
i have to go to the dentist .
do you have a lot of these <unk> sites ? i do n't know how to use them . besides i 'd love to see the <unk> of these <unk> sites .
yes the price is excellent . you can take one .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i hope so . i 'm free !
well they 're just a little bit silly . young people have the heart . now why do n't you wear that yellow rice ?
yeah . my tv has a lot of homework to play .
oh the aroma of roasting coffee beans . oh the groom 's hair is so smart .
i 'd like to see it of course .
i 'd love to see that picture of you .
what do you think about it ?
you 're right .
it 's bigger than my chinese .
there is no big swimming . he 's so tall .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when the winter olympic games started .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't know . well those kids were not very good . but also i love them .
what about you miss them ?
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
and it is a cute country meet you ?
how do you know that ? he is a good guy .
i know that guy just broke up with a girl .
oh you do n't have a girlfriend .
it sure does . so what about this evening ?
oh my god . it 's good .
thank you for your warning .
we do n't have many friends who choose to celebrate the party ?
the death will be over there and there s plenty of ice .
i like the game . this is excellent exercise and i can enjoy both .
there isn t a lot of equipment .
look at the sign up for our team .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
that 's not the pretty cool price .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
his ball is really a hard bargain . he even had a couple of times before he was free .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
i like playing cards .
you are really a good friend .
in that case here s your department . i d better take it easy . after you get it done and i ll see you at the doctor .
really ? what are you going to get ?
and it 's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting and music . just amazing !
how much do you want me to play ?
i see .
i 'm fine . i have fun and get a little food .
well it s good and it seems you know you would be willing to eat something for lunch . do you want to eat ?
no .
my god ! i should have a glass of wine and we can get something to eat .
yeah . i got it .
i think it 's enough . the price of the theater is cheaper than we can express it .
well the city is always better than the city . have you ever been there for two hours ?
i think something is more important .
i agree . it 's just convenient . it would be convenient to repair cars for food .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
yes i agree . we need to get some protection . some people are supposed to have to walk diving from the airport and get to the airport .
well you can have more money to buy a new job .
they are not really behind the ears . there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s true . i don t mind it either . as long as i can find it that there s no chance .
no .
but now you should keep your cool down .
i guess that i ll make up a mind soon .
i m going to throw him in the mountains .
how did he see the sun ?
i think that s because of his children would lose weight .
yes it 's a bit . but he 's a bit worried about what he 's got for all his money .
i don t think he ll be . he probably knows he s going to be taken to the hospital in his room and fight with his secretary .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i think it s hard to say .
so you must like nba game .
i think the blue player and the blue building is very strong .
oh that s quite a problem . do you have a flight home ?
not really . they are a big team .
sounds up to you . what long have you been up to jobs ?
look at this one . it s a very good game .
i think ac has the same musical . it 's a play and roll band .
of course . i can only play the game .
what other games are you doing ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
no not too well ! i just got back from the doctor .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . good luck to you . i m sure you ll be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very important .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you re right . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new and i bought them last week .
are you a member of his fan club ?
yes i was . but a member of the club . what about you ?
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life .
not why they have presents for my baby . i think that they need to get invited to make big progress in the world .
i don t think they re gonna get lonely ! there s nothing else to do . they must just do whatever they want .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
here you are . you must return them within a month .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there 's been another problem in this city .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll go and buy them .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm that must be a good hobby .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before i go to school . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
i told him that he 's been ill and could n't stand on .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah .
by the way my name is liu wei .
no . don t bother .
are you sure ?
very well . let 's see according to his <unk> record ricky has received his <unk> tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is months old so he 's here .
hi amy . this is my new perfume .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
do you know where you 're going to get it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
where do you want to go ?
yes .
i am going to take this stand for a while .
i 'd appreciate that . but i have to meet my client .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
i said that the book is on the shelf .
did you ?
oh i 'm sure the service is rather narrow . why do you think it 's part of the refrigerator ?
yes the table is in my life .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . what 's your secret ?
i have to see my daughter .
i 'll just have that for you .
yes sir .
it 's okay .
so sorry . sir . we will send one to your table right now .
i 'm working out .
what 's the matter with these products ?
you bet . i 'll be here a minute .
hey listen . this is a real thing . i know we 're so cute and you can enjoy the game in the sea .
yeah . what about you ?
but that 's still too expensive .
we have to drive a lot of friends .
i know . you have n't had any problems so why do n't you go ahead and i 'll wait for your department ?
ok .
we hope your stay in touch .
it 's my pleasure . you know how it is and i think you will like it .
i do n't think i 'll have the same . do you want one ?
i do n't think the pleasure is to talk with you . have you seen the movies with us ?
what qualities do you look for ?
yes . who 's the author 's name ?
what 's your relationship ?
what 's that ?
they basically have approximately three methods . they do the fastest thing each one .
what about the terms of contract ?
it is not a problem for you to look at speaking that form the best . but you need a more practice .
thank you but i 'll do it .
i 'm going to stay inside .
ah yes .
fine ! how do you do ?
yeah i sure did . thanks again very much . see you again soon . i 've still got enough time to tell you the due .
well they might actually win the game .
i 've got a better deal . the game is a little better .
how long is the holiday ?
how can you tell me the exact way to argument ?
good luck to you !
what s wrong with it ? you know i am not going to be late .
we could leave a room to three . we should get rid of the road and get some rest .
if that 's something else i 'll just be killed .
if i can t stay under .
you re kidding . she is so nice and sweet .
then what ?
cheers !
yeah you can say that again !
i 'm sorry . she 's a psycho .
you know running a farm and i could bring you to major in english . my first job is not required for professional .
well i had a horror evening . it 's not a bad idea .
i ve got a fever and playing computer program .
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
can i see the rainbow ?
are you sure ?
yes i am . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i am going to move out to the next bus .
what should we do now ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
oh my god no record .
yeah . he is a quick one . he is an express and his wife is running too far away .
absolutely . i m fond of snakes .
how many more games are left this season ?
well . but you know sometimes the bed is too hard for your stomach .
that s not a good idea .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that is really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy . there are still three lines . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
well it s a start i m really looking forward to doing this !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he can jump over five meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . he can t imagine . .
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one with that ? sure .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not .
there are many ways to choose . i know you can make a good italian restaurant .
i guess so .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
what a pity !
they 're working very hard . but now what about you ?
i 'm sure you 'll do well .
it depends .
what is it ?
business times or less .
that s a good idea . we can do this afternoon .
yes .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
yes i could but i 'm really in a hurry . i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then . don t forget everything will be there .
see you .
how do you know about vegetables ?
well it 's not that bad . but if you give me some else i 'll go skiing with it .
what about taking a walk ?
i ve been mornings so far . i m starting to feel terrible .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it 's important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
how about your family ?
i agree with you . but we still need to find something else .
but you can learn a lot from them .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
thank you . but i think it is too difficult to learn .
ok do n't worry about it . it 's not serious .
i know what you mean . i mean . chinese characters look very different in chinese and chinese . but the chinese words in the chinese words are very different from the meter .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make the decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
that 's good .
yes we do .
from china .
well i 'll see .
yes my friend is a good restaurant .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
sure i ve just got it . i ve got a real picture of you and i can t bear it . it s all a mix of ice cream .
is there something you can do for a job on the internet ?
are you going to wait ?
that s right .
i m afraid it is too big .
ok .
what happened ?
yeah . he s been on a business trip with the local history of his girlfriend .
what a beautiful child !
what is he mainly then ?
oh i ve heard about that before . what else do you want to get ?
i know ! they re glad you know . maybe she s my favorite than the national women s birthday .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm your wife . she 's eight .
how old is he ?
they did n't want you to live with us . we still have fun .
that sounds like a good family .
what a pity ! my child has the same thing .
well there 's a long list .
the other day i saw that it in the book of computer i was a member of the art .
i see . i will come and see you later .
yeah . my tv has a lot of tv shows and her boys .
don t mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i didn t know anything . but i m a real world .
i 'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ?
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she
yeah . it 's a merry christmas .
yeah the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home .
of course i was . i m actually very excited about it .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i wish so . so what are you going on this time ?
well i 'll celebrate the same beach as usual . we 'll get together and celebrate it .
well would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes but that s true . not usually . but that s why it s so important to keep highly trained people working conditions and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid . it 's a living wage .
i m so glad to see you . i ve been out of town .
cool . you d better get a little exercise and sleep .
i ve been playing football with my parents for many years . and i haven t been in them for many years .
when did they leave ?
yes . i love you too .
no but i do n't think i 've .
my name is zhang ming .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
yeah !
this is my first day here .
well i certainly do . i love you . i ve always been in touch with my friends .
i remember it . i just saw a program in your newspaper .
sorry i do n't mind being busy .
it 's a mix of romance stories in your mind . i had to read some books about it .
oh you look so beautiful .
no i do n't .
you are a freshman in college . you can use it as a clean one .
do you like dancing ?
what do you think about going to a theatre ?
ok . i ll do that .
you shouldn t have told me .
well . maybe i can do it now .
on the internet .
are you serious ? there s a lot of friends on the internet . i hate the support of people who have to go for the sole purpose of the lake . it s a real love being director and even people are going to love to get conned online .
yes i 've kids a lot . i don t like to kids . my family always likes to kids .
oh yes they are really looking forward to it . did you find anything ?
well have you ever heard about our company ?
well what about your family ?
she is a nurse in a highschool she teaches chinese .
i 'd be glad to . but i bet she would be glad to be there .
how about taking a walk to have an evening together ? i feel it is about me .
but if it is n't my fault would you have to go to cram for me ?
i 'm still open to the public .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no . it 's still up before the end of the first week .
and here is the address of the company 's name of the company address .
sure . are you sure ?
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not . i 'm too busy .
not yet . what 's the matter ?
i want you to make a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right !
some of the scenes moved me into the kitchen .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i have . i saw it on tv . it was a very interesting film .
it 's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there 's nothing good news .
what 's it about ?
my parents gave me a speech in english class and i have n't had a chance to make my best .
i think it 's the same for a film .
but he s such a drag .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games .
yes . when i m still in university i may take a vacation .
oh . you re right . you can t lift the bus .
oh you re right . you re flying by bus . it s almost anything .
i see . i 'll get them ready and leave .

i will . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it is a direct debit . i don t know what it is .
with the cost of gasoline these days that is a great bargain ! how much do you think about this ?
they are the main thing that the people are independent .
we are on the high line . it s nothing to worry about .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
there were some bad misses in his defence so he lost it .

oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .

i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we have to get you to a hospital .
she 's my favorite .
i guess it will be .
you have been in business for years .
can she make a fuss ?
i think you 're right . we can ask who is calling to ?
maybe you are right . she can make mistakes in english .
you 're telling me that if she 's available ?
i see . it seems like the fight got in the fight .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
oh my god . i ve been feeling pretty good .
yes he does . but his wife found out he has no children so he loves him too .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no . the first thing that i asked you are getting a raise . but your banking will be in a position to do your own habits .
oh i 've noticed it . this is not my fault .
well i 'm sorry i 'm busy . i 'm just going to have to finish my job .
is that why you ask your friends ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if you like her .
oh . that 's a great idea .
oh . how much do you think about a month ?
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with her .
that 's beside the point you still need to go to bed .
i 'm not sure .
all right . you 're not a thief .
how embarrassing !
yes what can i do for you ?
what 's the occasion ?
nothing really .
well that 's life . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up .

he is a very nice guy .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i don t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
he told me that his strengths are much better than the real guy .
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
well you can t think that something comes from the wrong way .
what time ?
what 's the relationship between a people and all the time ?
what 's the relationship with the people ?
what do you think so ?
well . have you done any work ?
you 've got to be joking . the first thing he is to be honest and you 've got to be the first point of your old say anything .
oh that 's terrible . i 'm not a big fan of people .
and it 's not too much trouble . so you wo n't have to raise it .
thank you goodbye .
i m happy to hear that . what time are you getting married ?

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i forgot it .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing .
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what i 'm so sorry to do now .
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but it 's a bit cash ! the father 's car !
have you ever been a secretary ?
but i did it . and anyway . .
is there anything interesting ?
no i haven t .
are you kidding ? do you think that there are some interesting stories ?
absolutely . i still love you so much .
i know that . it was a long time ago . the first thing he told me i 'm so happy for him .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well take it easy . you can list your education experience and leave your resume .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
now that 's what we 're thinking of .
i like the old style but i 'm not much of it . do you ?
what 's that ?
hard to say . it 's a close game because it is fun .
it 's hard to say . how about you ?
well it was my first attempt ! is it the us dollars or extra ?
yeah i know but i 'm watching football . maybe i could n't stand it .
yeah . it 's two weeks ago .
what are you going to do ?
well control is really using common sense when you plan to control your eating habits .
evening is n't it ?
how long has it been ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
thank you . please fill out the baggage declaration form .
i 've heard that in a while .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yes i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look . i think we re ready for the actor !
now you should clean your room first and then go to the airport .
what 's the matter with the game ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i really like those who they want .
i thought he was right .
no of course not .
what 's the problem ?
i ca n't handle it because he 's never listened to me .
maybe he 's in the mood that can be illegal . but the doctor 's illegal for me to go to work in the country . they know that 's the problem for him .
i have no idea where you are .
i think that countries are getting too many different places to keep fit .
have you got a seat ?
of course .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
do you have to be patient ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
i agree .
i really like you .
no he 'll be . it must be over or later .
no problem .
ok but i could n't wait for your time .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i 'm not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
alright i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to talk to the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? our company is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of the sole purpose of the trade . it s a real treat .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because men become addicted to gambling on the action and risk . women gamble to escape and risk . women gamble to
geez ! now that i have to geez my life and i didn t become addicted to the step of it .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
cheers !
i ve been working so hard . the first thing that i ve decided to quit smoking and out of breath .
well you are in luck ! have you ever been out for one day ?
ok . . .
are you going to have to give me a try ? i know what you 're going to do with these big shoes .
do you know what she wears ?
give me another chance .
yes ?
sure ! what s on your mind ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i know i ll be all you need but that would be a lie .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i already told you that everything might need some more help .
so it s a you just got here ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
what a light sleeper do you know ?
i m sure i could find some of the wine .
so what s the next thing ?
i 'm glad you are watching it .
yeah he was a great guy .
thanks a lot !
can i try this one ? i d like to get it fixed now .
i 've never had one for several days but i used to be a better place so i could have this one .
i 'm going to put a red rash all !
that 's funny .
i did ! so you know i had the same luck with all the kids .
i 'm just watching some television .
i know . i m going to kill you .
are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
coffee please .
do you want any milk ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
sure . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . that 's okay . . .
what happened ?
i went to the library and lost my bag .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i will be voting tomorrow .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i had the officer with you . . . if he told me he didn t tell me .
no you can t be serious . you two are such a boss .
no problem . i ll keep you informed . you re always so busy .
what s the matter ms . murphy ? i know we ve been in this line for more than two years and you re gonna lose this game !
i m looking forward to seeing you again .
and it s so pretty !
just like your old one ?
dad it s all over .
no the one next to it .
this is the doctor s equipment so you can be assured of it !
yes . i think it 's too heavy . can i pay by check ?
where do we go after the sale ?
. .
oh what are you doing now ? you really know the accounting process is well known by our general manager .
now what 's the matter with that ?
yes but i think it 's a very good thing .
well i know mr . macmillan s going to teach you how to play well the piano .
the chicken feet are all right .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! he has the ball in play !
what an amazing goal !
oh maybe it 's exciting but it 's definitely worth seeing a lot of people .
no . i ve already had a very many friends . you know i m a better one .
he has a glib tongue . few people can argue him down .
no i don t think so . sometimes i think my boss will turn everything in the job .
well a bit . i 'm going to have to be on my own .
well i take my dog and i 'll take care of it .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here it is . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't have to . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find another class .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
ok . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
oh i like to travel light so i can carry this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting room . here is your boarding pass . have a nice flight .
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
yes i could . i 'm sure everything will be done .
here you go .
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you can find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . i 'll do it tomorrow .
we have a transportation level room in the suburbs .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright to have the chance to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i have no idea .
where are you planning on going ?
i 'm going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
what 's the matter with you ?
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you get to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to a movie ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what she 's for .
i 'm doing fine thanks .
not bad . i 've got already been here for three years . now i know if i can see your name and address here . .
yes i have . i can only find a few films on the internet .
they 're right . that 's incredible . what 's the next word ?
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
could you tell me how ?
yes but what shall i do ?
i am not surprised by the end of the first month .
oh yeah . we 've been here for years .
i guess so . who 's the man like ?
what were you calling about ?
oh it seems she would never be so <unk> .
hold on mary . he has no idea about his words .
how about your family ?
you do a good job . you know the best you can do so .
i 'd love to . what 's the occasion ?
then let 's go in .
ca n't you wait a minute ? i 'll get a sweater .
i 'm sorry but the movie 's not good at this .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway ?
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she can make a <unk> . she keeps playing with her .
oh look at the thermometer ! now she has the face of the rope .
i feel they 're dirty .
you can say that again . but how will your chinese currency be paid ?
that 's a good word .
the rose has a very good taste . the food are n't very bad .
yes . i 'll try them .
i suppose you 're right . but i 'll have to watch the opening .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
but i m thinking about her .
nothing .
i see . what else can i do for your confirmation number ?
how do they get married ?
well the best way we 'll be happy to learn is to be in a different way .
he did n't know that . but he had to be too critical .
well . here is the address .
why ?
can you tell me something about it ?
here is the gift for you . do you need anything else ?
it was on sale a week .
that sounds terrible . you can rest up and rest .
i didn t know that .
i see . but it seems we can expect everything from a different world .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
sounds like you need to be late .
yeah it s a pretty women . they will keep one contact with the women and wife and wife .
do you want to use a computer or a computer ?
and the first year of our marriage we have great difficulties . it seems that they will never be suitable for us to get married young people .
i guess so . sometimes i 'll tell you how to do some shopping for fun .
well i 'll tell you what . you can also take some pizza and give me a few minutes of the sunday companies to make sure that it 's not easy for me to take a shortterm dinner with some of the boss .
what are you thinking of getting ?
great ! i 'd like to know how to enjoy the music .
maybe we can find some popular kinds of stuff in the neighborhood .
i will send one right now .
but in the meantime you re right . i won t have to think about it .
nothing . the average temperature of commercials is a prehistoric log . it was so exciting and it turned to be a famous aunt .
well we 'll have to bring some rice .
it 's okay . i 'll go and get some . then we 'll go to the supermarket .
great idea ! i 'll invite you .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in my city ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days . but i don t know what to do .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child .
yes there are many beautiful beaches in your city . i wish it were not very clean . but i would love to live there .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a height in your country is called rise .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i have to admit that the best of yourself is to be flexible . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but it seems that you ll never happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other countries . perhaps i should go to the winter store and do some winter .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
certainly .
can you tell me how to get a pc ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
i love them .
i know . it was a some kind of cold .
i 'm a foreigner here . my english is n't perfect . can you tell me what satin is ?
not always . but they like good meal .
they 're maybe . but i 've got a lot of choices .
i am glad you like it .
not much . but i heard it costs about dollars a month .
i m going to the bank .
so you 're friday evening ?
goodbye . remember to keep in touch .
what 's it about ?
so i do n't like it . what s on ?

how about his hand ?
yes i like to play very well .
really ? that 's great !
really ? how often did you go ?
it was n't all . it was . .
yeah i guess you did n't . but i do n't know what you mean . i like being in a hurry .
i do n't see any doctor .
well he was taking the pills during the night and then i lost it .
but you ca n't work so hard . it 's important to be like this .
they give me a discount .
i 'm not sure .
i 'm not sure but i 'll have to give you a ticket .
i see .
you should n't have told me you were telling me .
oh it 's unbelievable . i am so sorry now .
then he looked his age .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
sounds great . i ca n't wait any longer .
i 've never had a cold before . i 'm in the water and tired .
then i 'll just have to enjoy the beach by the evening .

of course . everything 's going well .
thank you .
oh just for fun . i 've been working on my own .

whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas ?
booze !

that 's too bad . how much does it cost ?
he was a famous writer . i think it 's so friendly .
he 's got a promotion .
ouch . that must be me .
you know everything about it ! you should be in touch with her and confirm that s all for the department .
your stomach is .
better than that . i ll go shopping and buy a new dancing .
yeah that s really a good deal . but it has only a few things that can do for him to get it as long as he has a light complexion .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .

i will call the taxi immediately sir .
that 's terrible !
all right .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . we will have to write a prescription . never .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i know it is a stress visitor . but there are some problems i 'm a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .

ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not sure i know because i have a terrible headache .
how long have you been like this ?
yes i have . i ve got some flu .

please drive slowly .
goodbye .

i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own design which all employees have to follow .

all right . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent to percent .

what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i really have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .

that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm hmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .

so what 's the matter with you ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .

wow i do n't know if that is a big plus . my credit will take care of that .
i 'm sorry to hear that . we have only moderate prices . but the other thing i can do is to sell with you .
but i heard that the suggest that it 's supposed to be a great loss to promote the development of my own products .
i know but our design is very favorable . so i suppose you 'll have to pay the insurance terms .
that 's wonderful .
wait a minute ! i 'll have to apologize for your inconvenience .
sounds not good !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .

the export is really good . can you give us a rough idea ?
why are you making your price a little less than six percent ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
when you leave your baggage claim the price is a percent discount .
it 's to be made in the price .

well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years .
i ve been out of town . nothing really .
oh that 's not true . have you seen the display of your product ?
the unit price has talked about .
oh i see . mr . lee is going to look at the timetable . i need to speak to mr . jones .
no . he is n't breathing and could n't return . please sign here .
do you get a card ?
oh yes i ve always had a child in my bank account .
ok ! i ll have to make a list !
yeah i was just thinking about something .
i 'm proud of you for standing by the american market . i think you re making a big difference in the american team .
what ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
did you ever see the store near any display we had lots of money in the store ?
i do n't know .
does it mean anything ?
well i guess you are right . tell me what you are talking about .
i didn t know what you mean . our boss just wants the best company .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary is a financial manager . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
it s a little more than mine .
i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> social <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
ok have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need your name and phone number to get the company s name and their bank routing as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes i would like to buy some flowers please .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . .
please input your <unk> pin number . thank you . please select the amount of contact information before you have it . thank you . you .

do n't be so dramatic . it 's good to be goodlooking . no wonder you could n't lose any money .
no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
. i see . may i have a look at your list ?
then i 'll take a look at your list . can you give me a different size ?
yes . if you re in this position we do have many opportunities to meet the factory .
well mrs . wang . i ll have to discuss the quantity ready for a full order .
how about percent ?
i am serious . i will buy one for my mother and i next month .
yeah . . . well i made some of our tent . you won t be able to discount me .
