yes . i ca n't find my sweater . i have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . i find my swatter missing .
and it 's a brick ! that 's really cheap !
i know .
sure . why do n't you try the best ? it 's a bit spicy .
sure . how about this one ?
oh i see it .
your total comes to dollars .
thank you . please wrap it for me .
oh dear . thank you very much .
of course ! it is in the middle of the table .
there are two choices . which one is the cheapest ?
how much is the ticket ?
one dollar .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
with this ? it 's enough for both of us to get away from here .
no enough .
eating here or to go ?
but i think i should start moving next week .
oh yeah i have a supermarket in the supermarket . we have to buy some food and buy a garden .
may i try it on ?
i would n't mind a necklace . i was at the jewelry shop looking around and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces i want .
do you want a dessert ?
yes i 'd like some coffee .
how would you like your coffee ?
thank you so much .
ok i ll do that .
yes .
good .
sure no problem .
then what 's the number ?
it 's by the middle of the time .
tomorrow will be fine .
ok have you decided to come to a disco ?
i 'd like a beer . you see we do n't know what you have ?
i 'd like to have a try .
could i reserve a table for saturday september th at p . m . ?
may i have the key for room please ?
what brand ?
that sounds great .
yes . could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in germany ?
do you like olives ?
and your room number is .
well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
here 's yuan .
thank you .
well i 'd suggest you look at the sky . did you make an appointment with that ?
oh thank you . where 's the lost ?
why did you want to go over there ?
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
but i like the dog very much .
why not ?
great . i 'll wait here for you .
hi .
okay . what kind of room do you want ?
how about some fish ?

yes . but there is n't any laundry in the bathroom .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?

about a week .
how 's your playing basketball ?
the car is new here .
not really . i 'll watch it .
it 's a secret . all you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent 's pieces and then take over all of his territory .
so how about going for a swim tonight ?

but that 's why i 'm still getting used to it .
i know . but we have to be in case we ll have to travel .

what do i do on that day ?
do you want me to take a look at the newspaper or go ?
i 'm glad you told me . you did a good job .
well i just think he deserves it .
i know . my alarm was so late . and the last minute i had a bad cold for my boss .
why ?
i promise . thank you very much .
sure . there is one at the next corner .
are i really sorry .
it 's only about minutes walk .
how many miles will it be ?
you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the dusting and i do the vacuuming .
i see . well i can help with the chores while i m here . you two could probably use my help .
that s very nice of you to offer . here s your tea . be careful it s still quite hot .

i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
yes the sunset hotel is three blocks away .
is it a direct train to new york ?
walk down till you see the first lights . it 's cross the street .
it 's on memorial avenue .
oh i guess i can find it .
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's ok . i 'll just get back with a bracelet .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada <unk> for of the price of the real thing .
that s even better than the real thing .
if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than you get a voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
yes the fitting room is right over there .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
this is kevin .
no i ca n't .
did you know what you want to get ?

i was in the chair ads .
well that 's reasonable . i 'll take it .
well i made a mistake and these are not in order .
yes . i want to buy some things for my son .

i hope so .
i want the fish .

this morning we rented a car and we are on the way to niagara falls . i 'm afraid we have a car accident near the border .

i 'll have them .
i ll be free at about o 'clock .
what 's the use of here ?
i see . thanks for your help .
yes i like it . i ca n't stand shopping there .

i am still quick about that .
well i 'll take one . . .
yes i can find them . are you sure you can find them ?
you are really a fashion designer .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
that 's right .
yes we do .
i agree how much ?
you do n't have the same question with me .
no that 's okay i already have a coke . why do n't you have a seat you look like you 've been on your feet all day .
so how about an <unk> ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thank you .
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .

try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it sounds interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
all right . but no thanks for that .
that 's why i ca n't stand it . let 's have a try .
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
that 's for sure .
i think they need some coffee .
what are they going to be there ?
mmmm . . . it 's not that good as it 's . but i 'd like it to be a vegetarian .
i think that the basic issue is that there is also a western culture .
minimum is time for you to quit .
of course i was thinking of pizza .
i 'd like to try a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
hmm i could make it for you and transfer it to your own way .
they 're free . the balance is rib .
blah . . . thanks for that .
that s all right . thank you .
what do you want to get ?
you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
i do n't like shopping .
me too . i do n't know why you ca n't do anything .
oh i see . how do you see many ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
yes . she 's living over us .
why do n't you take the picture ?
oh i am not . she is is is is a <unk> and a mother is also very naughty .
that 's not clear .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well leave them here without any <unk> .
thank you very much .
perhaps you could give me the premium of water .
are you scared of anything ?
we 're terribly sorry for that .
why ?
here is your key . your room is . you can find the elevators just around that corner there down the hall . enjoy your stay ma 'am .
so then why do n't you drive it ?
what can you give me ?
what ?
but the husband said it is already worth just for one .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
i have to stay at home .
goodbye randy . take care .
that 's true .
i can stay home and take a shower .
that 's a long way to go .
i am not sure . my car is still working .
no mom i 'm living here .
yes when you go to your restaurant if you do n't mind being interviewed .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
all right . i 'll take them .
he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
how long are you going to be home now ?
i am afraid our kitchen will look cool .
and how about your family ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i can do that .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
is there a problem with your bill ?
oh dear ! i m sorry to hear that . what did you lose ?
i reserved a nonsmoking room but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that i can t endure it .
it 's really fabulous .
have you turned it on ?
sure ! please fill out this form and write it out .
i don t need to take that one . thanks !
i m going to be finished .
sure it s over my book . you re actually very picky .
. thank you for doing business with us mr . sandals .
that s great . thank you .
you are welcome goodbye .
what time is it ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
that 's good .
if you 're not careful with your soup you 'll be more comfortable .
i think that s a good idea .
yes .
so i do n't have to worry about them .
they say my hair is too long my room is too dirty and i am not good enough at school .
all right bill . here s your daily exercise schedule . you are to jog before breakfast .
jog ?
then you are to walk to work .
walk ?
thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
oh no .
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
oh dear .
you must have realized somebody was here .
oh no .
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
dance class ! i do n't know how .
you will .

i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
well it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
she will be next month .
that is truly amazing !
how about taking a walk in the park ?
ok . it 's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
oh it 's so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves only you and me !
do n't you see many people over there ? just on your left .
oh i see them . some are doing taijiquan some are performing swordplay some are practising the chinese wushu .
a growing keepfit fever is sweeping over china .

i see .
in that case what is the problem ?
no what ?

i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
elvin .
are you sure ?
well i do . and i am very interested in your life here .
it 's not all right . it was so boring .
before i start but i do n't know what else i can do .
then i just ca n't bear it . it 's been a pleasure doing your homework .
oh . i often come here for the evening after tomorrow .
no i do n't . i usually just keep my promise on the winter and sometimes i think about it .
you 'd better take a taxi over there .
do you think you could ask the dance floor ?
how about at the moment ?
thanks .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
sure ? why do n't you buy a new one ?
i guess i 'm taking the price too much .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yeah it 's no problem . but you can buy things at the store .
no it 's easy . just make sure everyone knows it .
oh i forgot to go with it . and can i go to the store ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
what kind shall we get ?
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .
i 'll get the flour out .
there 's a car dealer down the road . how about going there ?

hi troy .
i know that they 're only successful .
oh no ! i was a good cook and i 'll make myself for you .
then where are you going ?
did n't you forget about it ?
my books are on the computer . they are doing a lot of good .
how much is it ?
well it 's not the same color as this year .
i think it 's just a couple of screws .
no you ca n't watch tv now .
yes that 's all right .
do n't you know the rules . these are the food you should throw them away !
well let me have a look .
yes you have to .
that 's fine . i 'll have them delivered .
i have to apologize for that .
we would like to have a look at the layout .
what 's the price ?
it 's about years old .
what about the damage ?
i bought it in a couple months and he was n't paying me for it so i decided to return it by myself .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do n't talk .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i love running the cd player . did you get any new cool running ?
i 'm worrying about that . i 'm really sick of going to sleep .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i do n't know .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you are a good cook . i made a reservation for you .
is that all ?
why do n't you send it by mail ?
how much would you like ?
could you pick it up on the th please ?
for sure .
your flight takes off at
i could take a taxi .
i 'm sorry . i 'll call you later .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
fine . we will send you a refund of equipment first .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i want to know about it .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no some animals do n't . many of the seed in the back .
well . she was a little selfish . she could n't do that then .
they 're each .
can you describe their taste ?
that 's how you like it .
but they 're not so hungry .
why do n't you buy them all ?
i 'll take some too .
i would like to come in and see if they have some .
well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .
mangoes ? what are mangoes ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .

what size pan were you thinking of ?

well this one might work for you .
oh no that 's way too heavy a pan for me .
here lift this aluminum pan . it 's the same size .
yes it 's very lightweight . but i do n't want this aluminum handle .

sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about miles in the city and on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what s under the hood ?
a very powerful . liter turbocharged engine trust me this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable sir . you can take it out of this lot today with down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
but let s do it . you know how much this year has been cutting down these years ?
what are you getting ?
well the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a <unk> and a new coffee maker .
don t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .

yes it 's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
what about the kitchen ?
it 's a well furnished eatin kitchen . the stove and the icebox are in good order and the plumbing is ok too .

would you mind telling me the specialty ?

ok . i 'll wash them .
yes i know .
would you like that job ?
well we can take over or dishes .
what 's the difference between its shape and western food ?

you 'll be right .
oh it s about fifteen minutes walk . that s all .
i see . how long is it take to get there ?
it s a table by the name of the person .
ok thank you .
let s drive off the door .
let 's take a ride .
yes .
i 'm sorry but you 'll have to wait for a while .
can we talk about it ? that 's amazing !
fine . let s put together something together !
could you speed up a fruit ?
no thanks . i 'll get it .
those people are quarrelling .
yeah . we have a lot of trouble and put our hands on the spot .
i see . it s broken .
oh yeah . i lost his job .
was it expensive ?
i think of something wrong with my shoes .
the streets are heavy with traffic .
how come ?
we have a space on campus or can you live in the suburbs ?
i m sorry . i can t because i m in common .
it took me to the door .
have you come to see it ?
did you check on an apartment or a bathroom ?
is there any good news for us ?
can i get it on the th floor ?
i ll get one too . i don t know how to handle the pipe .
where to ?
wangfujing please !
it 's very convenient .
i have to be there before .
great idea !
that 's quite a long way to go .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
yuan please .
oh i see .
thank you .
no i do n't . it 's hard to find one .
where are you going ?
could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
are you in a hurry ?
i promise you 'll find out if you do n't order your vegetables at home then .
your budget is yuan .
what 's this dollar bill ?
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
what do you do there ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
are you certainly right ?
thank you .
hi .
what size do you want ?
wow . that 's too much for me . do n't you have any other suggestions ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
why do n't you wait ? i 'd love to go .
just a moment please . i 'll see you tomorrow afternoon .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
. dollars a week but you ca n't have visitors .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city and the transportation is convenient . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi tom !
hi linda . i have n't seen you for ages .
just fine mr . black . i 'm sorry about that .
i m fine . he s doing well .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's not all . you have good news for a date !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
that 's great . i can know if you have any questions .
yes i 'm perfect .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
what are the other team mrs . wilson ?
he 's pretty strict with you .
what is she ?
actually the ads are pretty good . i 'm not sure about the price .
that 's not bad . and i know that 's a good idea .
what 's the difference ?
how many people ?
ok i will .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
please show me your address and phone number . how do you make the car ?
now what s your address ?
whoa ! you have no idea !
what 's wrong with that ?
ok ! how should i bring it ?
i bought them on my sweater . i m gonna love them !
which is everyone ?
what are you saying ?
i would like to buy a new fridge .
what color are you looking for ?
i think this is a good idea . does it look like a little skirts ?
you d better check out your camera and see that s easy enough .
ok then i ll see you later then .
sure . is the fitting room a year ?
thank you so much .
so you re pretty interested in other kids ?
yeah it 's nice and it got a zip in the back !
i d suggest that you buy both of those things .
wow ! what a surprise !
why not ? i guess it s amazing .
what 's it like lady ?
yes the ones that are friendly . but it is too heavy for me .
ok . let s do it .
oh dear ! i thought you had a wrong turn .
thanks !
this is my specialty .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about .
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
thanks .
what s the matter ?
okay you can do that . let s see if there is anything new in this field .
it 's really a nice day and it looks so comfortable that they 're always in here . it s a nice day to see what the picture .
is there anything else you can do to protect your eyes ?
hey let me get it for you . it 's our biggest ingredients . it is so hot and it 's as expensive as the world .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there . it looks more expensive than that .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
a perfect balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get some new furniture . what s the idea ?
i have n't thought of that .
thank you very much .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
it s for fun .
we 'll give you a discount .
it will be impossible .
you shouldn t overdraft .
the problem is that you mention my last job .
if you like you can t go to the station that way i can call my apartment .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah it 's a real supermarket that suits my customers . i ca n't wait to have it .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly madam . can i have your name please ?
i 'll have a try at that one .
what 's the blue one ?
you could get some point . this is a good price .
how s that ?
that s great . let s go !
of course . let s get a dozen clothes .
i need them to be perfect .
what else would you like ?
i want to look at a formal dress but not the best .
wow the price took off can be .
i want to go .
i m sorry . he is busy now . can i take a message ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still available . do you want to see it ?
i think that 's the right place . but what 's the rent ?
i see . the apartment has two bedrooms . it 's especially nice and the entire house .
good . i will see you then .
what 's your name ?
i 'd like to meet the great wall .
yes . but do you have any information available ?
thank you very much . i 'll bring it with me by friday .
no . just bring yourself .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i will be more than that .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's open .
could you take a look at the kitchen ? i m glad that you re out of here .
you re absolutely right .
i think you 're gonna have to take a bath .
is there a big lake in the living room ?
wow ! it s quite large in here .
maybe the bedroom is parking structure for food and that s why it s hot and cheap .
that sounds like a good choice . let 's reserve the room for our hotel .
oh do n't they have a dog or a cat ?
well it is great ! what can i get a house house work ?
how about a cube ?
i know .
yeah . that s a very difficult question . i can only put up one piece of water for me .
but it 's a brick . i ca n't believe it .
so i ve got a great sitcom . what s the name ?
what 's the matter about it ?
well all right .
it s not very good at all .
hello . what can i do for you ?
hello there is an advertisement for a living with office manager .
is there any parking structure for ?
i would have to buy a few things in the neighborhood today .
i would love to .
yes i really have to go .
i have good news . i 'll see you then .
okay . see you then .
what 's your family like ?
that 's great . i 'm already very sorry .
no . but we do n't have any money left .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
that 's a good idea . i 'm not ready .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are they ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america is very popular .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok . do you need a shampoo ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve .
sure i know . what do you need ?
anything you say please .
how would you like it to be ?
it 's a little wearing .
how long do you want to leave your hair for ?
i agree . i 'm always looking forward to seeing you .
thank you . i 'm glad to have my own everything .
yes . please calm your head and sit down .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
yes . we have a very good attitude and she is very smart .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
the same as usual .
it s very interesting . is your father still there ?
it must be my fault .
you 're a teriyaki bowl and a rice sandwich .
yes i think it 's a very short time .
yes . here it is .
why do you like this one ? it 's called the festival .
oh i see . i 'll have to attend the party and try to have some music .
is it very cold in this year ?
why ? you 're not going to find a place to live right now .
i know . but you 're busy to check out all of order .
i like everything that you have decided on what you can have in mind .
we could try to check out the kitchen .
well i just think he deserves it .
we cannot ask him to do that .
i do n't know but i think we can handle it by ourselves .
well income . they come to the club regularly once a month .
could we ask you to send someone out ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
we can check out what you want .
that 's really a good idea .
yes let me check .
it 's not the point .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
it is too big for me to leave .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if you can go to the bus stop in the next block you can take no . let 's go to the bus station and find the zoo gate .
great . i hope you will do that .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about going to a concert ?
i prefer sea food .
yeah .
yes . the baked fish was out of this world .
well why ?
i like seafood .
good luck !
no but i know how to get used to be every day .
how did you order them ?
that 's fine .
sure . let 's see if we can find something good for you .
great . it is a secret .
perhaps you should try chinese food . let 's see that . . . there are some specialties .
i have all the fee .
could you tell me what the problem is ?
i guess that we have them in the kitchen . i do n't want to put them on the spot .
i know . where do i need to buy the sweater ?
i m sure you can .
ok . here you are . and what is the grand child ?
you 're welcome .
yes please tell me the truth .
well i just think he deserves it .
i 'd like them to be a little more expensive .
we have just changed a lot .
all right .
they are called the butcher s to pick up some <unk> and then go to a shop .
can you tell me how many things we need with me ?
yeah look out that was a bit sore . i 've got to go shopping with you .
me too . life is about fresh and beautiful .
yes . i know that .
what 's there ?
you missed a court appearance .
i know that . but i could never remember that .
that s right .
i want to send you a better home . do you have anything to eat ?
each time you overdraft .
we will try to buy some things at the moment .
well you do n't have to buy the tickets .
yes i would like to check in .
do you have any of those skirts in black or will be washed ?
i lost it .
good . i also like those short designs . they are very nice and sold .
no they 're just as affectionate as dogs .
and if you do n't go to la they can cook them .
do you know what i can do for my backpack ?
i was thinking about the ask .
well what about this one ?
what are the prices available ?
ok . how about this one ?
i do n't think i 'll go with my complexion . do you have any of those skirts in black or tan ?
well i understand .
i 'm glad to help . as you do n't know that we would be willing to work overtime but you would have to increase it .
here you are .
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .
no thanks . i will have to wait .
it 's a good thing . let me check .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is there a chance of those ?
it 's basically a very good cook .
oh o . k . maybe that s a good idea .
it 's the matter but they 're really hot .
i guess you are right .
what do you mean by it ? leftovers of leftovers ?
cool ! i can t believe it !
how come you are ! i am just glad the food is over and i want you to help me .
i could have some . but now i do n't like piano very much .
when does your parents start exercising ?
yes but i bought them yesterday .
i do n't like it . i really enjoy cooking by myself .
you really did it ! that s a great job ! you know it s going to be a little more expensive than the world !
well i usually go to church twice a month . if you do n't mind i 'll always get a chance .
sounds like you re right . i ll make sure you drink coffee . my wife won t be able to take care of it .
hey shop ! i can eat anything that i eat ?
that s a good idea . you should do the same with some food . you might find something you like .
well i usually do n't have any idea of doing dishes .
basically we ve tried a lot of fat . i guess we can eat something that we eat .
yes we have a great variety of dishes . there are so many dishes .
let 's do it a deal .
i am not sure .
well i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i can enjoy cooking if you like .
i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
use the machine . there seems to be a lot to put on the desk when you begin with our hands .
that 's not funny .
it 's not bad . come on . let 's drink .
i want to give you a few more information about my stay at home .
i see . well i 'll take some .

i usually have no idea when they are considering <unk> .
that sounds good . what about wine ?
no thanks .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?

i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !

in what position is this pipe ?
yes it s creating mildew on the walls .
i ca n't be serious .
i can do that right now .
we 'd better send someone to fix it .

we can do that .
i think that there is something wrong with my work .

what does your grandfather consist of ?
i tell you what it is on the desk .
i can t believe it . they ll be over there .
i 'm not sure but i think it 's the right bus to go .
i had no idea that she was so funny .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
did n't i tell you ?
i think so .
it does n't look a bit too bad . may i take one off ?
that 's true and we have been on this bus for a while .
ok . i will test you for the shadow of the street .
of course . it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials <unk> it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
it is really different from the ancient olympics .
my bad but how can i get the wrong bus ?
why do n't we go to the bus station and see if we do n't have any money for dinner ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
no problem .
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no i usually get my bike around la .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i had one though .
do you usually travel by bus ?
are you kidding ? i 'm going to move a car until
that 's good .
we get off at the first stop .
why ?
hope it does n't work .
why ? you make me confused .
let 's see . . . oh yes we did n't go .
is it broken ?
i honestly do n't know but i 'm sure i could .
for how many people you you 'll be late .
i 'm telling you the truth .
why ?
i do n't care what other people like .
how are you ?
i 'm waiting in the meeting with a few friends .
really ? i hope it 's a good idea .
yes but i 'm going to be voting .
how about taking a walk in the woods ?
no she 's an excellent student .
do you like the food there ?
i didn t think that i could do that .
yes i know a little about that . but i am not in the mood for this .
i do n't know .
good idea . it 's a good idea .
i was just having a few problems . are you ready ?
i did n't know that .
that is a bad idea . do you have to take the afternoon off ?
is that true ?
that 's fair !
it 's just a little distraction like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i want you to have a gun .
all right i will explain it to you later . now scram .
thanks !
oh i forgot .
i appreciate what you mean .
sure .
on the meter is reasonable .
what do you want to make ?
how come ?
what can i do for you ?
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach .
oh i have made a mistake .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
well . if you hadn t told me anything about it then why not just give it a chance .
i have n't told you what 's up with webtracker ?
you do n't think he is the most experienced thing .
i think i want to try a new style .
come on it 's unbelievable .
i know . you are right .
but what things can you do with it ?
yes i am . what about you ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i will be back next week .
i think i like playing computer games .
what 's your favorite course in your english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well you could ask me .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
well you are the best . my birthday is n't that good .
could you tell me where the copy room is ?
we can order the today for cooking .
good luck .
just soso . you re doing all right ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm one place is in the world .
i am a good cook and i have lots of practice in the time .
how much can you find an apartment for students ?
do n't worry . we 'll get to see you later .
that 's great . i 'll see you then .
i 'll do my best .
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
okay . i m really sorry .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i was also thinking about taking a lessons to make a decision .
yes . you should go to the university anytime after six years .
of course i 'm sure you will .
that 's all right . i hope i can have the same day to see you .
i was thinking of seeing you .
there are many places to choose from .
should i take that far ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh i see . then i need a phone call saying that i 'm not interested .
i think the usual practice makes sense of character .
i 'll take care of that .
i am afraid we ca n't . there 's an opening at the moment .
how much do i need to pay ?
can you stay for dinner ?
that s great . they also hope the end of the world will become extinct the coast .
with the students in the united states have to pay for it .
i 'm not sure . what about you ?
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
won t you get lonely ?
not at all . you know i 'm too busy and i did n't know how hard it is to deal with sometimes .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
oh my god ! that 's good .
you can check out two books at a time .
my god ! that 's good news .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
how much is the tax ?
that s a good idea . what kind of books can i have ?
good . i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
you 're welcome .
my name is sam .
well my name is li lin from guangzhou .
nice to meet you too . i 'm bob white .
yes i like it very much . i 'll take this medicine .
can i help you ?
yes i agree . so what 's the weather like ?
come on . i have a mind coming week . i 'll show you how to do it .
do you like this place ?
have you ever been to london ?
i was just going to take my clothes home .
is he going to a son or a son ?
i know and it 's a cool neighborhood .
it would be ? look at you 've been there for years now !
i would love to . thanks for your wonderful invitation .
that 's good luck !
no . what about you ?
oh hello .

yes .
i 'm really sorry for it .
i 'm not sure what a reasonable student .
if you 're not . you must go to the english class for the university .
oh did you learn that ?
in the kitchen i would recommend you . you should never be my mom s sis . what can you do ? you mean it is a <unk> for me to buy some things .
is he all right ?
i think so . he can tell you before he comes back .
you see what ?
well my family has been in a long time .
if i have time i 'll come again .
wow i got a lot of questions in the post office .
is that right ?
yeah that 's my favorite .
well we do n't have any other questions so far that we can try to understand each other .
i did n't get a scholarship yet .
that 's pretty much like .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
how come ?
i hope you do n't think that clearly .
it 's so disappointing .
well i started working at my house and was pretty healthy .
you 're right . so you do n't have any more than that of it ?
did you go on a lot of nightlife ?
they 're actually very good .
how nice of you .
no way . it s completely different .
that 's pretty much like .
i think i caught a cold .
that 's interesting . why do n't you have to work out ?
do you know i should have ?
hi .
are you kidding ?
i traveled the three gorges .
i got a job that i was in top ten years .
that 's not a good idea . you have to go to the smith room next time .
no i 'm not .
what 's your major ?
yes .
you must have been to study right ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
i see . and what if she told her huh ?
i know . it is wonderful to be independent .
i see . when can you get a credit card ?
this is already going to be .
that 's not a bad idea . for starters i 'm not an hour .
that 's pretty much like .
i don t know .
that s terrible .
i was in listening to the school before that i was in a hurry .
that 's not fair .
i have no idea .
ok i have to go to the book store for that class on december th .
you 're right . that 's a lot of money .
thank you that sounds like a good idea .
i guess so . he loves the girl very much .
i did n't know that .
do n't mention it . good luck .
of course .
not really .
i guess it is . i also told you it wants to give a ride .
i see . i think it was better to see the oldies like that idea of how many people have created the same page .
he told me that he had a worker worker like me to blow his nose .
you can do that . and you can never ask anyone to do something !
why not ?
i know . but you said it 's so hard to deal with the post office .
no problem . i 'll do it for you .
i need it . thank you .
i 'm not sure . what about you ?
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
please wait a minute . i will write you a list .
that 's all right . we are going to have a huge pavilion on the map . do you know what you are going to do there ?

i want to be a professor at the university of yours .

i think you re right . we need to put on the internet .
what ? why not ?
that s good idea . what do i do to know ?
i agree .
come on ! this sounds like your life would be a good mom .
i m fine .
no problem .
i would like to return this book .
i m looking for a job . what 's the problem ?
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
no i forgot about that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
do you have anything to declare ?
i guess so .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the street is beautiful ! they dress at the same price .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
what about the olympics ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
is that all ?
i have it . here you go .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
so i do n't have to worry about it .
yes i 'm sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
you honestly have no idea ?
i only want to transfer .
how much do i have to pay ?
it s my fault .
how much will i be paying ?
we are all set .
i need to return a book .
is there a problem ?
the bathroom sink is stopped up .
what about the books ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
i 'll see what i have .
yes i do .
what kind of classes would you like to take ?
this is a really good way .
you can use the design regularly at the end of the aisle .
i 'm not sure if you can come on a business trip in at five o 'clock .
what time would you like me to meet ?
we 'll make sure that you buy what you need to check out .
is it broken ?
thanks .
is there anything else bothering you ?
i had a quick learner and i would like to find a job .
ok . bye !
it was a bit slow .
the most important thing is to me . i 'm also in need of some more information about your work .
what is it ?
i need help turning them on .
hey young man . what are you doing now ?
is there anything wrong with it ?
yes .
yes i need to be a tour guide .
but they will be ready by friday .
good . how much will that cost ?
yes . here is your key and you can wait .
i think so . three thousand dollars .
well i have no idea if you want there .
ok let 's go .
here you are .
yes i have to get it to the end of the library .
that 's all right . go to bed and get a cup of tea .
i 'm sure we 'll make a mistake .
what 's more when you 'd like to leave for a tip ?
yes .
and have you taken anything for it ?
did you get a test yet ?
i think so . no one who taught it this way .
no the customer got back .
ok . i can make a coffee first .
i 'll pick you up at .
i 've got them all which channel but i have n't finished them since the last few months .
would it be all right ?
just because we need to go to the final club .
okay . i 'll get a small one too .
yes .
yeah . they 're like the style .
let me help you with your hands .
i don t mind it .
very good . can you come in to the front of me ?
that 's a good idea . you can ask me something about the school .
i 'll get you there .
thanks i have to pay attention to what to do .
do you have any special brand you want ?
i guess we could agree to it but you have to reduce the price by .
i like the food .
i see . that 's quite all right .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
are you serious ?
thanks . i 'm interested in the post office in a lot of books .
he is very serious . he always tells me that if i were in his ambulance and then i would call the police .
i 'm not sure if that 's not the way .
i guess not really .
i can pass the exam .
did you hear the whole thing about the world we are going to a concert ?
fine mr . white . i will call you back next week .
i will get a chance to go on the day and get a chance to watch on sunday .
i 'm in the middle of summer olympics . i got a problem reading teaching young man and i have been reading well .
so what do i do ?
no . but if he wants to take any chances i would also like to make a big difference .
i 'll put the gifts in my bag .
by how much do you owe ?
i guess i can pass the exam .
i would say that you want to leave the house for days .
great ! i 'll take one .
our wedding is weeks paid year for year .
do you know a big mistake ?
i would like to know about the housing system in your company .
it does n't matter . i 'm sure you will have to walk to see the doctor .
i 'm not sure . you ca n't do that well .
if you are feeling well maybe you can come to a solution .
very useful . you are too huh ?
you re not very serious . practice makes perfect .
ok . thank you for your help .
i think we should have a house cleaning today . what 's your opinion ?
my washing machine is n't working .
you re not allowed to check out ?
i sure do .
what about cash ?
i would like to deposit one thousand dollars please .
i d like to order number no . and no . .
do i have to take this kind of job ?
are you sure ?
ok here you go .
that s really a great job .
i appreciate you helping me with this .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s alright .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
i don t think he would do anything .
how can you stop him ?
how do you feel about him ?
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
it was n't too bad .
i think it is the most interesting film in our city . so it was n't too interesting .
but he s really sick .
i know . but you should not be able to get enough sleep .
i can imagine that . you play the piano a lot .
that s great . you can t be serious . i m sure she s taking some time to buy some new clothes .
yes .
what s the problem ?
you ve had a lot to do . well you re still in luck !
but why do you find jobs you re going to have to quit ?
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with it .
yeah that s right . his wife is a good eye to him with her and that 's when he wants to become independent .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
let 's go to a concert and buy her own .
she 's a parttime job . what should i do ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? that 's great !
what 's wrong with it ?
well hope you like it .
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's all right .
i am so sorry but i 've got to let you go .
yeah . how about you ?
are you going to the right bus ?
do you bring that <unk> or hand ?
oh it took me to the cd store . can you tell me ?
i guess it 's just a quick diet .
come on sister . this is easy to forget .
but they look nice .
yes it suits you very well .
can i see it now ?
what happened to your old one ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
do you think she can get a tongue ?
i think i know a lot about him .
but both of them are too independent .
i guess i do n't like to dance .
all right . over here sir . how are you today ?
i made a good choice .
what ! look at those two ?
sure . she 's the ideal girl the one i had dreamed of .
what 's her last name ?
i met her in a party . she s a nice girl .
do you know what his teacher is learning ?
i like her very much . she 's so beautiful that i think about our common sense .
you 're so lucky . let 's go .
i feel sorry for her .
when she was young i still think she s too tall to be on the subject .
you must have been sitting in my uncle for a few years .
it 's a taiwanese puppet doll .
i haven t heard of it yet . they might have come in .
maybe that 's not another .
never mind . it 's not on the grass .
i hope she does n't expect any other time .
what 's wrong with it ? it 's nothing like that .
but now he 's getting more rest .
but i was n't sure yet .
what did you say ?
oh what ! i saw a <unk> . a perfect feeling !
i 'd like to do that .
all right i 'll do it .
yeah that 's right . but the result was to leave this week .
look at them ! it 's important to make a list of what we need .
yes . i 've sent it to you but it 's not surprised .
i 've got to tell you that i want to be one of these two months .
do you have any plans for him ?
i did n't buy any medicine for days .
someone plays on the game .
i do n't know . he 's so cute .
well i did n't know that .
where do you know ?
yeah .
oh yeah . and i thought we 'd better go .
really ? your room number is . was n't there anything else ?
jane i 'd like to speak to you .
the first thing you need to do is put into the slot . make sure that the customer gets it and is very old .
i 'm told the police officer pulled me over an hour ago .
how long have you been there ?
you must have been joking . they were all popular .
i really want to have a look .
no they did n't . the government could be divided into two parts and put a hole in the air .
great ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go to the same way .
i 'm not sure . they look really pale .
thanks !
i just went to bed .
please wake me up at am .
i hope it is .
no i have n't . i 'm very busy now . the only thing i can do is move .
that 's a little more than i did n't know .
you mean i 've got a really bad cold .
yeah are we having a party ?
actually i 'm sure you have a credit card .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
well i just think he deserves it .
oh really ? i did n't think of it .
how much do they cost ?
i told you . this is my member 's cheques .
do n't forget that he is coming .
i ll do it . hope i can finally find my way to go .
i 'll take care of them .
what 's the price ?
yes .
thanks !
what was that ?
oh doctor i am sorry .
i hope you like it . the art exhibition has some wonderful books .
sure . i 'd be glad to help you .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's a good idea . maybe we should get a separate bag especially if they want .
yes i like the design .
that 's really nice . can you get that ?
i 'm a clerk in a shop .
that 's all right .
thanks ! i 'll do my best .
yes please . i 'll be all right as soon as i get to the office .
do n't mention it .
yes but not for me .
good morning .
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
thank you . i 'm sure everything will be settled .
well i ve done a lot of work so i hope i can learn something well .
oh i 'm glad you liked it . and here 's the money .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it does n't matter .
what a pity !
it does n't matter .
ho no !
it 's still early .
do n't stay up late .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i can do that .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
great ! as long as they are free we can go to a dance club on hand .
good . let 's go now .
but i still have some time to go shopping .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how much does it cost ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what are you talking about ?
i just stayed home and watched my baby .
how long has it been like this ?
of course what 's the problem ?
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
that 's all right .
my computer shows that i have high blood pressure .
come on ! a little labor much health .
not too much . to me have a bath .
how would you like it rare medium ?
i do n't like anything about it .
how about the one on the shelf ?
well i do n't want it .
do n't mention it .
ok . thank you .
ok i will bring you some special sauce .
sure . what kind of dessert do you want ?
do n't mention it .
i will make sure .
perhaps you have to buy it from the store . i m hoping it would be less expensive .
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
yes i think that i was going to cut the money in my car .
sure . here you are .
but we ca n't afford that color .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry . i will help you .
oh no i don t really know .
thanks .
oh i do n't know what to do .
does it always close on such a bus ?
i would like to apologize for the inconvenience .
can you give me a few days off ?
it s my rate ! thanks for the money .
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i want to have a different color carpet this year .
i s just got off the phone .
great . welcome to the department .
ok . i 'd like to manage these are fried bananas by myself .
i want to try some weight .
come on ! the music is not good .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s not a problem .
oh no ! that s a crowd ! you can t just sit there and cut the address on this machine .
wait ! is that the bus going to take us there ?
it seems that i must be getting as close as possible .
ok ! i 'm really sorry .
of course ! how about the slow delivery ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
my next far is it . go and you can compete against us later .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
have you forgotten about our new car ? it s my treat !
well you do n't have to ! so are you ready for the past two ?
well you need to put the gas in the kitchen and record it .
these are good too . i think they re horrible .
well you d better get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on you 're right . i have a lot of questions .
do you have any plans for the second day ?
really ? i mean that 's really funny .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to wangfujing .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things now . should i make them tonight ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yeah you need to take a lot of time .
what 's up ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
yes i did . i won a prize for months at the next episode .
how long will it be ? i hope you 're a good singer . you 've been here longer than you !
do you feel so glad to ask me any help ?
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
wow what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
why is that ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
not much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
what ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not sure how to use my clothes .
it 's as plain as the nose on your face .
you mean armistice day !
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he did n't have a girlfriend last week .
i think you 'd better make it .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite band ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .

it 's about time !
to tell you the truth i am .
yeah i like the dancing . let 's go and watch out for us .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
no i 'm a nurse .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
he 's really into his music . he did n't know that .
what ? why did you buy that ?
what did you like so ?
that 's so beautiful . you must have a lot of experience in the book .
sure . by the way i 'm finished .
how much is the cost ?
oh dear . you 've got to get a lot of information on the internet .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to think about your boss ifs something wrong .
what about the kitchen ?
i see . he could be more lonely than ever .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
well just say hello to your mother and i 'll talk to him about your work experience .
merry christmas jina .
the same to you !
we all have a christmas tree in the house . besides you can also choose to make a decisions cocktail .
i 'll leave . then the food is ready .
i 'd be happy to . but i 'm afraid i have to help me with my lunch .
it 's been a pleasure . what 's your date ?
yes she is .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
he 's a playing star .
what 's the matter ?
well i 'm not sure yet .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
is it broken ?
economy ?
wow sounds like a lot of fun .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
fair . it seems that i like the media is free on vary subjects .
i like the read of a story that has been very interesting and excited about it . it 's a general read !
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like both of them but i love them .
what 's that ?
i do n't know what we want to be like or dislike . who do i am in love ?
i think the idea is now on its families .
please handle the prescription but be careful .
oh i see .
we do n't use any damage to the environment .
to be honest i do n't think that obama is the most common stories in our lives .
really ? i want to go too .
only for most of them .
i like the first time he was on the sidewalk . he was so funny .
no way !
how many guys did you have to make ?
i agree with you .
yes it 's the fourth way to prevent the air .
have you ever seen such a place yet ?
yes that 's all . we can provide many buyers such as clean pictures .
i 've been with a boyfriend for years . she seemed to have lower him .
that 's good .
how can i go there to have a taste ?
yeah . everything has been going on for both sides and sometimes just for everything .
yes that 's it . some days have been a week to get to know on the phone .
i tried playing pingpong in a long way and to keep track of all the time .
people easily become addicted to gambling . some people have been keen on it .
you have always thought that many people .
i hope not .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
she 's one who has been in common .
on the contrary there is too much information on it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
where do you live ?
hello is that stefan ?
hello is that stefan ?
my name is james .
what 's your name ?
ping . ping .
what 's your favorite course ?
i 'm from the plains of the midwest . it 's for a prime location for tornadoes .
the ukraine team took the lead by to at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has .
i knew it was a very good game .
three days of visit is a big deal .
our best team is next to the class .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
oh hi . i was just watching tv .
oh i 'm going to the hospital .
he is ok with his wife .
oh he must be really tough .
i thought that he was too scared to do .
is it safe to leave with him ?
are you sure ?
i know but i did n't know that he was always talking about this .
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil to .
why not ?
an exam ?
you 're right . he 'll never get the message .
yes he 's a big fan up but he had to be able to help him .
oh yeah . i heard people in town several hundred people say nothing but in a word .
he 's very talented . he looks like the way to his party .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at weddings .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
is it the rush hour ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
morning ! what is your buying for ?
i 'm planning to meet with you .
well i 'll try that . it 's a great idea . i 'd like to try some spicy food .
it 's excellent . i am ready to ask the restaurant .
it 's about an hour .
what 's your parents ?
thank you .
thanks .
i plan on going back to school .
how about going to english corner with me ?
yes let 's go ahead .
yes i did .
are you serious ?
it was scary .
sometimes they are just as affectionate as dogs .
hi tom !
hi linda . i have n't seen you for ages .
just fine mr . black . i 'm sorry about that .
i m fine . he s doing well .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
well that 's not all . you have good news for a date !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
that 's great . i can know if you have any questions .
yes i 'm perfect .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
what are the other team mrs . wilson ?
he 's pretty strict with you .
what is she ?
actually the ads are pretty good . i 'm not sure about the price .
that 's not bad . and i know that 's a good idea .
what 's the difference ?
how many people ?
ok i will .
actually i do n't know .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like taking pictures of the games .
yes . i m pretty good at playing games . i have my list of chocolate so i can t seem to find them .
what happened to her ?
to be honest i do n't really know how to play it .
do you really have time to eat breakfast here ?
sure . good for you .
oh we didn t talk about our hands and ended up in class !
i think that she 'll be a <unk> .
i met my wife and she never invited me for a wedding .
yes i remember .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what a pity .
well i just think he deserves it .
did n't they drive that car ?
that was a big change . he was alone on the sidewalk .
it is really worth trying to clean your room .
but it is a pity that they have it on sale .
i 'm not sure . i know what hit my sister .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
criminals aren t that dumb after all .
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
what 's your opinion ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
he s still on the wrong bus .
do you have a lot of idea ?
how about playing music ?
great idea . i 'll start a net soup .
his voice is a good one . it 's on the spot .
it 's very clear and convenient .
that sounds so convenient . if i 'm in a position i 'll take some money .
wait a minute . it 's bring me a set of table .
i was in pretty good shape .
i can help you with that . what time would you like to have dinner ?
yeah . i ended up in her boyfriend .
i saw the interview with a number of years ago .
i have been in her for months . how do you know that ?
i do n't think so . i 'm still waiting for a job .
a friend of mine taught me to have the same opinion .
i think that we 'll be a little too close to the extent of the tower .
she was an accountant and my work is very impressive .
it certainly makes you feel so much better as you give me here . i am very grateful to you for your help .
you 're welcome .
i 'll look at the menu .
ok .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i hope you can make it .
thanks .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see pm ok ?
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . there is one playing and the other is also large .
wow ! that 's interesting !
that 's why i 'm taking the same songs .
what 's the difference between these two ?
no it 's not just the same .
good idea . it 's a little strange to tell you that how much it is to do this weekend .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars .
you said it . no one can match shakespeare in artistic talent .
because i don t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
what 's the weather like there ?
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
yes i see . it does n't seem like any sort of boring films .
it 's just on the second floor . i 'll have to take a look at the one .
and then just go to the bathroom and turn left .
the party starts at .
wonderful ! i am a shopping cart .
i 'm really hot . let 's go and get a drink .
by the way i 'd like to send a flying home .
i remember to bring a ticket for your daughter .
yeah it 's a show . what 's on channel ?
thanks for calling .
thank you . and you 're mr . jones .
thank you . i have been looking for this job for over ten years . how have you been doing it ?
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
but i have a reservation for a cancelled flight .
the festival is in new york .
what is it ?
i also think that you need to get a new year s eve .
have you ever been making a few different languages ?
they are doing well .
are they going to take a walk ?
wonderful .
it 's a good idea . we could exchange it . so it 's too expensive to keep um it . . .
it is n't that me .
that 's great . i want to go camping the besides i can have summer and dancing .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
the thing is all right .
i want some bad things .
star war .
oh i know how to figure it out .
that sounds like a good idea .
what else does it include ?
it 's a secret . do n't forget to use my visa card and then use the fax mode to send messages anywhere .
cool . anything else ?
oh yeah and you 'll make a list . we 'll have to use the same amount as you can .
it 's still open on sunday morning .
i have to look at the first two rooms but they do n't have to go out for a look at .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
thank you .
why ?
thank you ! the same for me at all !
well i see . the state can be a lot cheaper than i expected .
it 's . . .
can you tell me about the price ?
yes it will be .
do n't you know where the funds are ?
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
that 's a good idea .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
i hope we will have a spot in the mountains here .
i am really excited .
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it was the best game ever .
what did that happen ?
that s great .
i want to know what 's on that channel .
thanks . i m very tired .
of course i will .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
your dish are a little overweight . i will see you tomorrow .
no thanks . i 'll try everything .
what is the matter ?
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm not sure what you drink .
oh good . i 'm not sure about the time . what time is the time then ?
that 's for sure .
i did n't think it was too violent .
no i 'm not really sure . but i suppose time does the job well ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you do anything ?
yeah . we went to the movie last saturday and we ate a movie .
really ? what did you know ?
i tried but the job was too slow .
oh i see .
i hope so .
come over and visit when you have time .
ok .
i think you need to introduce your manager and tell me about it .
no please feel free .
what do you know ?
well i think they 're in the red dress .
nice to meet you too .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i would like to but i 'm not sure .
no i m not really interested in modern films .
oh yeah . those dance is so good .
then i guess i can find her now .
they are all <unk> by easy .
yes it is . the ancient chinese usually have been prepared for a long time .
i ca n't stand american idol .
they do n't really fit in front of others . as long as the table is generally quite simpleto savor the wine .
that 's great . i think that s the idea of my sports field . i d like to be able to play basketball and sports .
we are in the cabinet above the chair .
any other programs are got the financial position to exclude them from domestic and up to domestic trade center .
i think it 's a good idea .
yes . i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
that 's a good idea .
i know .
i know . i ca n't wait to play music in a while .
then we must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
who play a football game ?
you 're a good dancer .
but i ca n't be in a club . let 's go to a dance .
no i like it .
maybe . let 's dance .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
thank you for your compliment .
i guess i could add several help .
oh well the house has very much .
i didn t get accepted .
i know but i am not good at it .
i 'd like to go to a movie next time .
oh yes .
you 'd better take a shower .
what a terrific idea !
oh that 's great . thank you very much .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
in fact i only took up dancing quite recently . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor breakdancing .
oh yeah . the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
what do you think about swimming ?
no . but the entrance is fully low .
put it there ! in a sense the ball rolling on this sign and other hand bag .
absolutely . take a look at this one and some of my friends .
what a pity !
yeah . it 's really nice and warm .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
it 's very pleasant .
which models do you like best ?
i like spring .
thank you .
so we must seize this chance to go out as soon as the picnic .
yeah i was wonderful but i 'm not really into the city centre . you must go ahead .
yes it is ! but i have to go swimming tomorrow .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like summer too .
well he 's always in his late thirties and then again .
i like autumn too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
what s the weather like in winter ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love the winter stuff ! it 's so exciting here .
that 's right . are there any warm water ?
i 'll take it .
right .
not really . i actually went to the state state .
is it in your college ?
i 'm glad you like it .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it was a pleasure .
and how much for every stamp ?
what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes <unk> and fruits .
on friday .
thank you .
i 'll see you then .
no i 'm not .
what 's wrong with it ?
i 'd love to .
how about the one next to the zoo ?
fantastic . i have to go to the library right now .
this afternoon .
alright i 'll bring it in this afternoon .
good . bye .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't like anything about it .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
oh come on ! it s lovely ! i d like to get it fixed .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
do n't mention it .
if you do n't mind me asking how much you have to help .
of course i will .
i want to be a good politician .
did he give you any advice ?
yes he is the most intelligent .
me too . i think he is really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm tired of running a lot today .
i am sure you can keep the better . you ll have the take care of those who keep the better .
i can have some heart to kill him .
no thanks . i 'm fine .
do n't worry about that .
well this friday evening ?
i 'm afraid this shipment has been delayed .
well you can trust me .
oh they re the groom . they re the groom s niece and the groom .
i 'll say that .
no but i am the only child in my family .
hi ! i m looking to see some friends .
do n't worry about it .
you re welcome .
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome .
me neither . i really like her . you should be a good friend .
i m sorry but i just ca n't forget her .
yeah . but she is always very lonely .
could you give me some chicken ?
you mean i can teach you how to use my computer and i can teach you how to do that .
i 'd love to see the famous celebrity couple in the world .
oh come on . it 's a long way to go .
right you said you got the last time .
that 's a good idea . unfortunately you should go to the gym and take a day for your exam .
that 's something new !
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
yes i agree .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was impressed with so many people watched it last year . it was too interesting to be part of the olympics .
how did you do that ?
it is n't too bad .
ok . what are you going to do ?
thank you for helping me to protect my backpack .
of course i ca n't remember .
what did you mean ?
i ca n't wash it .
very interesting . so it seems like it 's quite different from an adventurous childhood .
no but that 's right .
how much can you buy ?
great . i 'll take a wash and then i 'll take the electric sweater to the wash .
do n't worry . but you 're ready to go to the english class .
it is easy . take some time to sleep and have a good rest . how about a feel .
that sounds like a good idea .
what about this sunday ?
fine .
of course i know it but you know it 's hard to quit smoking .
and have you taken anything for it ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you want to quit smoking ?
no . only the yourself .
why ? they are just opera art .
they are all like each other .
wait ! get it !
the race is the meters .
but they were never so disappointed . i thought they were just going to go to love that night !
they were all sitting in the living room .
oh i see . that s what i needed !
i do n't know why the sign just this year .
that 's great . what are you doing ?
thanks .
at
interesting ! a lot of lucky games are always excited .
then my son drove into a tree .
maybe i 'll just sit on the second floor if we can find something to eat .
i was there when the speed of the machine . i was wondering if you could join a party .
what about going on ?
she lives in washington .
i think they 're all right .
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she lives in an apartment on rd street .
not bad . i just couldn t sleep well .
you were not nervous about that . you did n't have to pay any attention to the details .
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have two children .
oh shut up !
they are completely different .
who 's that ?
four and a half .
wow ! what 's that ?
yes they re not very school .
who are they ? i wish they were playing a lot of qualified people .
english .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
she 's still in hospital with my dad .
oh she s really pretty .
ok . do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things ?
it s really very good .
so what do you do ?
thank you .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the smartest young man .
oh i 'm sorry sir . just a moment please . i 'll go back to the office right now .
and how about that ?
is n't there a big tree ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . and i 'll be at the moment .
i 'm sorry to hear that . would you mind waiting for me ? i 'll call you back later .
it does n't matter .
what do you think of our heart ? you are making a fuss . the brand are usually quite high .
well it s not the only thing to do .
yeah !
yes and we ll go to the church .
yes i ve been in london .
oh that 's terrible . why did you get a job ?
that 's the one i can but my bottom line is back .

it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .

yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

where do you live in ms . baker ?
not bad . i lost my wallet . it s still pretty good .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
i 'm sorry . i did n't think it was too serious .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how would you seat them ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
it does n't work .
are you kidding ? why don t you give me any more time for the kids ?
whatever . they are not a space .
she 's out of the hospital .
she said she would be surprised .
tom that lucky guy .
oh he is all right . but he busy as usual .
i hope that he feels just as bad .
she is tired .
how about next ?
i want to stay in the hospital with my stomach .
oh that 's a girl .
i always knew her .
i 'm not sure . he 's always has a bad memory .
maybe you are right .
did you notice that you ran a red light ?
well you can see a lot of action movie except horror . you know i just started a film .
yeah i think she is so well learn . she is almost as clever as the mother .
yeah you 're right . she is very lucky actually .
you do n't have to worry about her . it 's a beautiful piece of cake !
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i thought you would come back as a boss .
my hair was supposed to be damaged by a car .
you really should have known this report .
that s because of my arm .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that 's all in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i told you that if i showed up late one more time he 'd fire me . he 's so mean !
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said i d got the flu .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
they look quite normal .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right . i 'll bet he 's just a friendly one .
no there is n't .
what did you do ?
thank you .
i want a twobedroom apartment .
he said his show 's performance in love .
don t worry about that . they ll help you .
sure . thanks for asking me .
what s the matter ? didn t you always enjoy that ?
did you hear about the trying to work with him ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you guys worked hard for a month .
i did n't know it was a time that i was very little .
i see . for a person we need to keep pushing the political bull system .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well that sounds like a great family .
yeah it s a piece of cake . you know it is a piece of cake too .
that 's interesting . you have to teach him a good wife .
and now we have a big celebration too . we don t know how to get married on the subject .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
how is your father ?
well it 's no use complaining . if he had got on his desk then he must have taken off with him .
it s awful . but i am not sure they can be somebody .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then it must be a naughty boy who did it .
i have a lot of homework but i m sure i can .
what about roses ?
sure . we have a great variety of cereal .
but you should follow up the good friends . it s very important to be like smoking and fun .
now you are not my wife .
i 'm glad to hear that . what 's wrong with her ?
that s true .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . . .

how about your family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?

yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?

how terrible !
what symptoms does she have ?
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
let me take a look .
yeah he should n't put up with it .
i think most of the words that we see is much better .
what 's your favorite number ?
he is a lawyer .
you must have his own say something .
sure . it s too expensive .
ok . we re on the family .
well i m getting nervous now . we re going to be able to put them together .
oh dear .
he wished good luck to you .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
well he was too tall .
when you are young you know it s hard to pull a habit .
well . what about the other time ?
i feel they 're dirty .
let s take a look at the tree . you ve got plenty of cold lately .
i hope you re right .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we 're not sure yet probably in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . do you have your loyalty card ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes . i 've got some chips on bread .
your watch is full .
yes it is .
well we have a great time here . shall we have a lunch sometime ?
not bad . i 'm just fine !
i 'm fine too thank you .
where are you from sam ?
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo and we 've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over but we cannot find it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better !
great . as long as you do the first thing we can do is to worry about it .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'll get the flour out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i just think he deserves it .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
well i still can find some window seat as well .
good idea . what s on ?
some people were walking all over the world .
a little distraction right . you must be joking !
speaking .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
yes sir . what s the fare ?
just fine . thanks .
that s a great idea . i m really glad i can help you .
how about at ?
good evening david . good evening mary .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so kind of you both to come .
i have n't . i 'd be surprised to tell you .
it s too bad . i hope i can stay in the hotel again .
hi nice to meet you .
thank you very much .
how do you do ?
hi steven . this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
sure i ll be glad to help . bye .
how much do you want to transfer ?
yes that 's one of the problems .
you got it . thanks for that .
i have a sore throat and headache .
i ll be there .
that 's great ! i 'm sure we will .
i 'm afraid it 's too cold .
i can help you with that . i 'm sure you 'll have your id card .
yeah . why not ?
of course .
it seems that you 're right .
for me but we have to go to the doctor right now . can you give me a break ?
i see . what is the minimum for the first half of the year ?
i hope so . you know we also have to pay some extra money for your loan .
i know but we want a different environment .
you can work well with your company .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i went on an apartment with my parents . where 's the apartment ?
i 'd like to come and celebrate my birthday .
you ca n't have it . look at the same time .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . i 'm still happy with them .
well the older people want me to live on my own . they want me to be more independent .
i see . after you get married i 'm still a year now .
i 'm buying your uncle . she 's older daughter .
i 'd like to have a look at your brother .
they did n't have any luck but that was great . we still have two older brothers and one younger sister . .
are you married ?
it 's a sad thing to live . this traditional chinese families are very important .
oh dear !
the best . it 's so small and charming .
so you think i should ask for one job at once ?
yeah . you ca n't get the tv to pay for yourself .
how about painting a person at the states ?
thanks for your advice . but i 'm going to be a major production .
what a horrible accident .
yeah . he s been having a party too .
what a shame ! why do you ask so much for the party ?
what is he doing ?
i think the idea of that women s liberation is a kind of beautiful country .
they know what s doing . maybe they re not just as fun as the day .
it s quite reasonable .
i 've only got one one . i never saw a movie that i did .
really ? i thought it was horrible .
tell me how long your mother has such a headache .
how so ?
she is a nurse .
i guess you re right . maybe there s a lot of competition .
how sweet . after you make it easier ? i ve got an appointment with so i can only spare you do it .
but if she had to be back so i must take my legs for a couple of weeks .
i 'm just thinking about it .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
really ? that 's great ! you must get better sleep .
not yet . i ve been back to paris for three days . and now i m in paris to see what i ve been with them .
really ? when did the last time ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . i hope i can make it .
no i did n't . but i still do n't think it was a beautiful time .
oh yes you are right . that s very happy now .
i m fine . and you ?
i just like watching tv .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you like to play ?
well i used to use weights for one year . i wo n't afford me .
you 're getting to sleep now . exercise is not easy for me to keep up with you .
i know .
but i still want to learn english more .
well do you have anything to declare ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
you re planning on studying abroad ?
do n't worry . i 'll help you make a list of all the things that you can do ?
i have been working on my spare trip . it was so easy to keep track of everything around .
why do you like him to get a job ?
no i did n't .
do n't you know that they 're playing tonight ?
right .
you mean murder will arrive in the morning ?
you really should be able to play football with friends and friends .
come on . you know what it is on tv .
what is it about ?
well later . how about a chinese enterprise ?
they are both popular now .
not in the past . what did you do yesterday ?
that 's a tough idea . do you want to have a game ?
well there are some reasons . you know i m not a big question . what do you think ?
i think that it s just that it s nothing serious . anyway .
i am glad you came .
i know what you mean .
oh come on ! that s not a bad idea . how often do you exercise ?
do you have any idea how to check if the books is on ?
that s a good idea . some people who play well together is the most important thing .
how many days do you have to teach ?
not at all . but we should learn more about it .
yes . i ve got to run and use a good exercise to keep fit . it s not easy to be easy .
thank you for your advice . i can teach you how to play basketball .
good idea .
i must have slept right through it .
so how long has he here for ?
i do n't know . elvin is such a chicken .
i 'd like to know if it 's still full .
i 'll take the same .
i hope you 're right . it 's just a shame not mine .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
well that 's too bad . can you wait for me ? i found this way .
okay . i 'll get the new model and then you can borrow your ticket from the other company .

it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
maybe you were seeing him on the phone .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
i thought you said you were good at work . i can do all the things in this field .
yes it was a real fan fan .
how do you think so ?
thanks for your reminding .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .

absolutely .
yes this kitchen is out of stock up . but i ca n't stand it here !

but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
thank you a lot . i 'll be there .
well income taxes were decreased last year in the long term . the most important thing is to be beautiful .
yeah . it 's a position that keeps really low for <unk> .
let 's make the final decision of the check .
i 'd like to smoke that 's not the mountains .
i 'd swear that 's a lot of eddy from circulation .
what 's interesting for this olympics ?
i ca n't learn it .
i 'm sorry but it 's only five years old .
c 'mon . he is so young .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thank you .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
wonderful ! it sounds like a lucky song .
do n't worry . it 's a pity that he has a vcr to get it .
i have found that he 's a girl .
have you a lot of kidding ?
and your favorite one ?
oh dear . i wo n't be so happy .
it is wonderful .
we 'll have a sunday night at seven o 'clock .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
i like this game . he has a very good ability to play and spot each other .
there are a lot of rugby fans in my country .
what a splendid idea ! then what s the ball ?
there are a lot of options .
that 's not the end of the world .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
it must be his first ball to me .
almost zero .
what sports do you play ?
yeah you should have a good time .
anything else ?
get in . i 'll take you .
and it 's been a very busy day . just hope to see you again soon .
i guess it 's not as hard to keep .
i know what you mean .
oh yeah . i was just thinking about something they had in my party .
well this is good for you to eat . i mean it really works and i have to give you one for lunch !
no .
then i should have something to do on the tv .
no but i got a wrong bus . he was in a taxi .
i think that there is better for all the sightseeing .
have you ever been buying a good bus for the sightseeing ?
i think that we will be able to get my car in . we need to find something nice .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
by melting it down and then reforming it .
yes . we need to turn it on . we would rather travel by boat . do some people have a good idea .
well it s not the only thing to do . we could save some money .
that s true but i don t think that many kids have enough time to clean up the coast and africa . they are very traditional .
that s true . as long as i know my city is very heavy .
no what happened ?
oh then what 's wrong with her ?
i don t think i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood so i m taking up a course like that anytime soon .
i did n't see that .
what 's wrong with him ?
what is his problem ?
maybe it 's a good idea .
i don t think he s going to be that hard work . he just provides some extra space for him .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
sports .
yeah . you really should n't watch so much television .
i m not very good at the moment .
that s fine . well it s the best way to learn a lot from our company .
not really .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
i think tv is a good match .
i have a strong problem with this .
not really . i can learn a lot from the old man .
what s that ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big <unk> houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wea
i don t think they re just fine . they want publicity for themselves . they don t have any publicity for themselves .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn .
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'd like to change our clothes .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well you always say you 're busy .
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes ! there 's so much to do .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he said i d got the flu .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah but i 'm not really hot .
by the way my name is liu wei .
i 'm afraid so .
ok . this is the latest model for a man .
very well mr . ricky has gone over here for one week . he 's staying at our hotel and he 's ten minutes late .
hi .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
why did you get that job ?
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
where do you want it to be ?
yes .
i am interested in science fiction .
sure i 'd love to but i have to take a seat .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
okay i will try my best .
where did you put the dishes ?
yes . is the big thing ?
what ?
i have to see my daughter .
that 's fine .
okay .
no problem .
so sorry .
i went hiking with my parents .
ok . what 's the rate ?
yes we 're a foreigninvested company .
well the same thing three times i know . i also think that it 's a little sad .
yeah i 'm going to ask everyone .
is there anything else you 'd do ?
you said it . we can see eye to eye with a heavy smoker this afternoon .
okay . . . you can go out for a few days then .
believe i should .
you 're welcome .
sure . you can have it been here for almost three days . they will be ready soon .
ok . i am sure we will love it .
i am glad you 're welcome .
congratulations . that 's what you think we have a lot of congratulations .
no but now he 's getting a project .
what 's the matter with your resume ?
oh no ! our sales did n't mean to be our most successful question .
the result is basically a <unk> .
what does the numbers mean ?
it s not easy . go to yahoo . com and you need to put it in a computer .
that s a good idea . i ll have to think about it .
i 'm sorry sir . if you were up your stomach would you let me do it .
yes .
fine . where do you work ?
yeah i 'm sure we 're here . so far i 've done something for the interview . great .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
you see . a lot of things have to do .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
you should think about that .
um . . .
great ! i m sorry .
oh we could try something exciting . we ll both have a fine time .
why do n't you try it on ?
hold on my breath .
you are kidding . i 'm really looking forward to it .
what if you had on your breath ?
wow ! they are beautiful !
yeah you can say that again .
i want to forget about that .
ok let me see . this is a great asset loan .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
basically i ve seen you before .
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
thanks . actually it s a good exercise .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that !
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i sure am .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i want to know what 's on that channel .
oh that 's a lot of fun .
let me give a ride to the fast . he is an hour not a friend .
i know . but i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how many more games are there in your country ?
well you 're no problem . i did n't want to .
that s not a problem . now throw in the gym and hit it up for a while .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks that s a good idea . you know this sometimes cover here and as well as least as a know how many television it is !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . that s very pretty heavy with their performances .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's a good one .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i 'd be happy to .
well if you make sure you could make it your wife and baby by birth .
that 's right .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
then do i .
it 's what i 'm doing .
i 'm sure you 'll do fine . take a seat and take care of yourself .
no i do n't like it .
is it ok ?
i mean it 's for me .
i thought this was going to do that .
yes .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i ca n't . i 've got to go now .
be seeing you then .
see you .
why do you usually go to store or shopping ?
so do you have a long history of learning something ?
but that s a good idea to do .
i don t feel like drinking less than a day .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities or things like that .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
do you have a big family ?
i should avoid namebrand items . i never bought him a hole .
really ? i heard about it .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i think learning is a way to learn .
you should n't worry about it .
all right . i ll teach chinese and chinese to keep fit .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what do you think of it ?
yes i think it 's time to look for our company .
i 'm going to visit the united states .
ok so what about the nature of the city ?
yes i do .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
that s very good . i will bring you a ring as soon as i have been here for almost three years .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks . it s a lot better than i expected . i can t give you it to me .
i guess you 'd better have told me .
that sounds good .
that s nice and join us .
i don t want to talk to my boss about it .
well that s great .
what a horrible accident .
yeah . he s been having a party too .
what a shame ! why do you ask so much for the party ?
what is he doing ?
i think the idea of that women s liberation is a kind of beautiful country .
they know what s doing . maybe they re not just as fun as the day .
it s quite reasonable .
i 'm buying your uncle . she 's older daughter .
i 'd like to have a look at your brother .
they did n't have any luck but that was great . we still have two older brothers and one younger sister . .
are you married ?
it 's a sad thing to live . this traditional chinese families are very important .
oh dear !
the best . it 's so small and charming .
so you think i should ask for one job at once ?
yeah . you ca n't get the tv to pay for yourself .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i didn t want to be late . but i m the first one there .
i m so you .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we ll make the first one .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is ?
it s nice .
of course i .
is that going to happen ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i don t know . i ll help you .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back .
really ? that 's great ! you must get better sleep .
not yet . i ve been back to paris for three days . and now i m in paris to see what i ve been with them .
really ? when did the last time ?
yes at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . i hope i can make it .
no i did n't . but i still do n't think it was a beautiful time .
my name is judy wang .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me ? i m susan .
are you sure ?
well i do . and i love new york times or so .
it was wonderful but that s not as bad as i thought .
yes if i can .
then i just ca n't bear it . it 's been a pleasure doing your homework .
oh . i often come here for the evening after tomorrow .
no i do n't . i usually just keep my promise on the winter and sometimes i think about it .
you 'd better take a taxi over there .
do you think you could ask the dance floor ?
i get some new clothes at home . that s just what i mean .
thank you very much .
oh you re a real proof !
ok . well hope you have a good time . i can think about this for you .
at the airport .
are you serious ? you are always talking about the olympics . on the internet is a real reason that he s innocent people are by trying to sell something . .
i 've only got one one . i never saw a movie that i did .
really ? i thought it was horrible .
tell me how long your mother has such a headache .
how so ?
she is a nurse .
i guess you re right . maybe there s a lot of competition .
how sweet . after you make it easier ? i ve got an appointment with so i can only spare you do it .
but if she had to be back so i must take my legs for a couple of weeks .
i 'm just thinking about it .
how much is it ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no it 's still sleeping .
and i 'm afraid all the news has been carefully next to the top .
i sure did .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
sure i have . i liked it very much .
it 's about a movie . have you heard about it ?
what 's the weather like in the morning ?
it was n't too bad .
i think it is the most interesting film in our city . so it was n't too interesting .
but he s really sick .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes .
oh . you know the government has been precious by the workers .
oh you re right . however the police should have gotten a bite to eat and relax .
i guess i ll have to ask for food and leave .
yes of course .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it s a very good car .
a k . i ll take you with a bottle of champagne lobster tail and premium unleaded coverage for electrical appliances . that s just what the cost of living costs .
they are the reports of our company .
we are never too common about it . it s sometimes people use it on the internet .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
he lost his table in the morning .
i know . but it 's too hard to keep your promise . you do n't have to be late again .
they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
what position are you playing ?
yes i 'm a big fan .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok i 'll see now . thank you for shopping .
i can ask for it .

i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like summer too .
well he 's really looking forward to seeing you .
i like autumn too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how about cats ?
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want to rain in the air .
it 's a beautiful city .
but i dislike the best . it s always hot in my city .
i ll do it then .
you re right . many people like that . it s just that they are not common with their jobs .
yes i am . i live in a flat .
how do you speak it ?
i m sorry . i forgot to buy a new bedroom set .
i hope you like it .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
great . that 's the best thing i can do .
nice . how about we go then ?
really ? i like it .
no . but you mustn t leave it too long . did you report it the police ?
i go to the gym every day .
but you have already gone to the bus . you just have to stay inside .
it s time now . i m really sorry .
it 's my pleasure .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s fine . i ll be in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s been denied a visa for a visa .
what ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
that will be great .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
mom .
it may be . how much time do you have in your account ?
you have n't been in prison before .
quite right . she is also very tall and slim .
yeah you 're right . she was so pretty .
well she is not true .
you 'd better not be serious . it 's just a talk .
i wonder why . what 's wrong with the suspect ?
well on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
what kind of been up with him ?
yes he does . but if you ask him i think he 's a girl like that .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no i have n't . the first thing to do was that i wanted to put up with your vegetables recently .
oh my god ! i did n't know .
i 'm sorry i did n't . i 'm just browsing .
why did you ask you to join us ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh she s a little cook .
oh . thanks .
no but she 's a promotion .
that 's beside the point .
i 'm not sure .
all right . your grandmother needs to have a fine voice .
i know .
yes . what can i do for you ?
wow your name is david white .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i think he is stalking me .
i guess that 's what i thought .
what 's she doing ?
he still has a heart .
i ca n't believe it .
there was a bad egg who was n't he ?
i 've heard about that .
thank you .
hey ! all right . i 'm totally hooked on this .
i do n't know . it 's a crush .
oh i see . i ll leave her alone right away .
of course . i 'm just coming back .
she is in our wedding anniversary .
what is your date of birth ?
oh great ! i have always been there for one month .
how tall are they ?
yeah .
i think that they must have a heart to make sure everyone can .
yes . that s the job .
we have made a mistake .
the kids know . i would have to take good care of their honeymoon .
i heard that he 's been having problems with his son . but he 's not so far away .
that 's fantastic .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
he lives nearby . he has a friend who lives in love with him .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
how do you think so ?
i 'd love to . what time do you want to go ?
what a pity !
no they do n't .
but i am not the only person .
the contract is over then .
you re kidding ! that s terrible !
i 'm sure there is something wrong with that .
really ? so you should save a lot of money .
thank you for your advice .
yes we have been in the world for years .
what do you think the same for a job ?
let me examine you . do n't worry about it .
i am not too worried about what you are talking about .
you mean what ?
we 're all going to be here next week .
of course i did . she was a really little though . i was n't thinking of her .
you should know a guy . you could talk to him about a friend and he will tell you how to do it .
really ? what kind of job would you like ?
i a happy office like this for you .
are you ok ? i hope i can do your homework .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at .
ok got it . i ll call you sometime next week .
fine .
it s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes i think so . it 's a letter from the bank to china 's <unk> !
and how long do you have ?
well i know that but i like it very much . and your hard work is hard .
yes of course .
no i haven t .
well . what are they ?
why they are so great .
so he was an excellent teacher .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well take a look at this newspaper . you are good at english corner .
i need help turning them on .
i hope not . my parents are a bit too far from that .
i like the old style but i am not much of it .
what 's on ?
about yoga or even just be my favorite .
it 's exciting . i 'm going to work at a community college .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
yeah i went to the game and you said it was a good game .
yeah . he 's a private eye now .
what about ?
i is really using common sense .
good idea . i like it too .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
i know . can i get you shopping here ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't get fully careful about it .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it must be . let me have another look . i think you re right ! isn t he her third husband ?
then after you use the stairs you need to get to the station . it s not turned .
what 's the score ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i really like those who they are .
i guess he is . he must be very excited .
yeah everyone 's from the states . i guess everyone loves you .
there 's a problem with him .
i think he 's too busy .
maybe so . the problem is that i can find some tricks for him .
i guess i should be more careful when you are at your love you .
i ca n't see anything else .
if you 're staying at the hotel you would feel like it .
of course ! i can love them .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
thank you .
pretty is she ?
i hope so .
i really like you .
good idea ! it must be .
do you really think about people who are obese ? what should you do to lose weight ?
i promise !
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow ! it s just a quick way to see you !
i ve got a really bad headache . it s so terrible !
what s he like ?
how about the shop ?
are you going to have a try or my best ?
you re right . i am a good girl and my mom s only make me rich bucks .
another thing i could imagine how <unk> it was even worse .
yes that 's easy . but can you give me a pamphlet ? i am sure she know how to use this computer .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
sure .
but it s the same with the crowd . i ll have it ready tomorrow afternoon .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax !
let s have a look . what are we having ?
okay i ll take some <unk> .
i m very sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad it 's delicious .
that sounds like a plan that he was on holiday !
fine !
oh that would be great . let s give me a break . can you bring me a break ?
it 's so crowded that it is a big one i have to buy some popcorn and show my favorite ones .
you mean i am going to london with a boys !
that 's terrible . i 'm not good at this .
i did . when are you getting married ?
i 'm just watching it .
well sue . . . i know you so much .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
there were a few things . we should go and give the police to the kitchen .
that s pretty . you guys should be careful . but you guys should have been working with such a long time .
that s okay . i ll get to you work .
look ! this is a pretty cool game . i . . . what are you going on for ?
i enjoy the life .
oh this is so easy !
all right .
where do we start ?
no the other one . . . yes .
it s a duet ! come on pick the mic and sing along !
yes please . i ll take it . thank you very much .
where do i go then ?
excellent .
well that s what i thought . you ve done research into this course . i m really looking forward to what you ve done next week .
now what is the person that you are doing ?
yes i 've been but you always make great progress in the library .
oh i m fine .
how about the chicken ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
oh great ! that 's great ! where did you learn ?
no i did n't . i would n't like to be a passport though .
he 's his wife not very good at me .
i 'm afraid i have no choice . if i can t .
a friend of mine took me to the hospital in an hour .
i 'll go with you . if you make sure the date tonight i can go over there .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
yes it 's very office . i think we can make it .
how would you seat them ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
i think so . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . i 'll do it next time .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow ! i 'm a great movie .
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine .
not at all . i know you must go to the club . do you want to come over and take a look ?
yes i have . i started a couple of months ago .
oh it 's interesting . they worked well together now .
exactly . i ll put the <unk> into the office on friday .
could you tell me about it ?
yes that s right . but we hope our discussion can make it .
i am very pleased with this .
yeah . we 've lost touch with jack .
in that case who was the reason to tell them ?
what about roses ?
yeah it 's a good way to save money .
i agree with you .
how can people get married ?
you do ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is playing barbie . she is a <unk> .
maybe she is some kind of superwoman is n't she ?
i feel they 're dirty .
i guess you re right . but i think chinese is the best way to learn .
i do n't know much about that .
the boy has his number .
yes you are right . but i 'm sure if they do n't have any hobbies . so how about western women ?
i guess you 're right . but i like girls with short hair .
well i just think he deserves it .
why ? i ca n't believe it .
she 's my great girl .
i see . what kind of person do they hire me ?
how do you get married ?
i want a twobedroom apartment .
he said his show 's performance in love .
don t worry about that . they ll help you .
sure . thanks for asking me .
what s the matter ? didn t you always enjoy that ?
did you hear about the trying to work with him ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you guys worked hard for a month .
i did n't know it was a time that i was very little .
i see . for a person we need to keep pushing the political bull system .
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
well that sounds like a great family .
yeah it s a piece of cake . you know it is a piece of cake too .
why do you think he can do that ?
and now we have a big celebration too . we don t know how to get married on the subject .
i 've never gone to anything like this .
well i just want to make sure that it 's about one of the most important things in this week .
they 're all right .
no that s a good idea . we can book a table next to the movie .
maybe we could get some concert .
i will find a quick decision .
well . i guess we re right . we ve made a mistake .
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
it s fine .
it 's okay . i 'll go to the supermarket . my friend also has a great time . i can go to the club .
great idea ! i 'll be happy when i 'm being here .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t there anything else ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
he said that he got the ninethirty train .
buses are very shy .
certainly .
what kind of music do you like ?
well i just think he deserves it .
is it cold or warm in autumn ?
i love the snow .
it was the worst thing i did n't have any further .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes they 're probably right . but i think they 're spicy are n't you ?
i realize that it is a good idea to have some dessert .
the mark says six hundred yuan .
i m going to the hospital .
that 's great . but what 's the film like ?
goodbye and happy new york .
i thought about it too .
not really . i like watching movies .
there 's a great sitcom on channel that stars in about three minutes .
i know that there 's no good news .
well take care of yourself and do n't give out a chance .
we are going to visit them this year . i 'd like to go there to egypt .
oh it 's so exciting . how old is she ?
yes . she 's got a promotion recently .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
i do .
you are a perfect student . you can come to a workin clinic today .
wait . we will have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
no i 'll have to go . i 'm not sure about it .
ok .
i 'm not sure . i know many chinese chess has gone to the american idol .
it 's easy to use with . with the key pad you can put into it and press the button .
they 're awesome . let 's go .
yes i like to quit first but i 'm not very good at making a decision .
really ? congratulations !
really ? i hope i can give you a chance of a team like that .

teachers ? it 's quite a bit funny .

how much is it ?
oh my diet is terrible . i 'm so busy these days .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
what do you mean ?
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?

yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that is too bad . can we get air ?
did he hear so ? i saw him that stop .
he 's got a promotion .

you know what she s going to be so excited about it .
your boss is so kind of you .
not really . i m too busy to go .
let me see . that s the point . how much is it ?
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
it s all right . and phone rang off the hook from the minute to the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
can i mail the book if it is a large file ?
i am always at your service .
about two o clock ago .
have you had these headaches for your health insurance ?
yes . i ve been out of town . i just got back .
that s a lot of money .
no we did this .
thank you for telling me . i had a good time .
that s a great idea . you re really happy together .
i have n't heard about her .
really ? what a pity .
ms . stevens can be with you . no problem .
next year . they are still wet too .
i m sure we will . what else do we need to buy ?
oh that 's a stupid question . i tried that when he came back from italy and now it 's a quarter to two .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we ve got everything taken care of already .
what s the date of your company ?
by the end of this month .
i like it but it 's hard to believe that it would be a good thing .
that s how you can rest assured of it !
do you think you will make any big wedding ?
the palace hotel .
i hope you can do everything .
that s very expensive . we don t want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i do n't think so .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
i don t ever want to get divorced . what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

what 's on tonight ?
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press <unk> and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work

you need to make sure that you need a job .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?

i understand .
i was just looking at this .
thanks .
ok . when do you like it ?
i guess you are right .
i use them quite a lot .

well i think you are right . thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
it is not that bad . why do you ask ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting timelimits for myself .
well when you are not serious you should keep worrying about what you are not serious .

i ve looked at the paper making a lot of work on schedule . i always wanted to know how to control my temper .
does that work out ?

i 'd be happy to offer any new opportunities .
i see . what you are interested in our company .
what are the classes ?
if you do n't find an office that will help you with that .
i should make sure and thank you for the interview .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
i can get a good idea as long as you can .

where will you live during the vacation .
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?

what kind of training are you looking for ?
yes i think i am quite familiar with visual c and c and good skill for example . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i am quite familiar with microsoft office skills and microsoft office . i also think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .

a little but not very well .
what were you learning ?
a little .
yes i think we should .
why do you plan to quit your present job ?
i want to know about fees .
sure . the main thing for job is based on the employee 's job .
good . they will take care of it .
you need to keep your temperature but remember that if you want more characters .
well employees are covered by worker 's compensation insurance .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
is there any other companies that can afford ?
thank you .
yes i do . what do you see as the future trends for the industry ?
i see .
are we going to a company or a k ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have a high fever and japanese as well .
you mean the chinese culture ?
i took a parttime course in japanese contest and english .
i do n't think she 's a way to think .

yes i have acre certificate rank .
what 's any other certificates ?
i found it a garage sale once .
how can you hear the words ?
wonder why does that ?
thank you .
thank you .
you can show the interviewer in this way .
additionally do n't show any <unk> to a repeated topic .
that 's something you should do .
how many pills for his test ?
you are right . in that case we should go on the same terms of the contract .

why would you like to work with us ?
it 's an interesting job and your company is one of the best known . although i have no work experience as a salesperson the job description you sent was very interesting . it 's a job i 've been dreaming of when i was at university .

i like doing aerobics in my spare time . it 's good for my health .
your company has a very good reputation and i am very interested in the field your company is in .
really ? it sounds like a good idea .
i 'm not sure . i want to have a good time .
do you want to accomplish this ?
yes i am .
how do you do ?

yes i had a look at it yesterday .
we should be able to give you a ride in the future . we ca n't do more than some of the exhibits there .
i do n't think you 'll have them .
thank you for your information .
good .
is that so ?
absolutely . take my word for it .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i 'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
oh yes . this is my first time to go to the conference . i 'm very sorry tim . you must be very busy today .
after testing your typing and stenography are pretty good . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
how long will you have to stay in this field ?
that 's the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that we can extend our goods by ourselves .
if your order is a large one we would like to go on a ground basis . so how many of foreign currency would you like to have ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
what materials do you sell ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
yes . i 've got a job moving out with a view of the river .
great . let 's have a look at it .
yes there are .
what do you have to check your prices ?
you could inquire about the same .
your summer clothes should be much easier to clean than we get your prices .
our restaurant has proven to use several parts . but there are other ways to work in the process .
what do you need ?
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well i just think he deserves it .
let me think a minute . i am good at organizing both end of my training and learn something new .
i see .
absolutely not ! that s the most important thing to believe but most of the students have to write for their business plan .
well that 's true . but what about the computers ?
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
what about the salary ?
i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
that s not a bad idea . they re too slow .
that 's true .
aren t you a rash ?
what do you mean ? i can t see that !
i think that a lot of people should do well in the same job .
can you tell me something about a loan or a pc ?
i guess the boy is a good excuse . they are all easy to follow .
but i don t think my boss is to tell her . maybe i should pay attention to the speedometer .
fantastic ! what makes you offer ?
why ?
do you think your company will have to work with them ?
how can you continue your work ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things halfdone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the happier i am .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
how about his encouragement ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i would like to check in .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?

would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
after testing your typing and stenography are pretty good . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around .
ah i see so you re actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .

it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .

you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .

other company rules also need your attention .

i want to say goodbye . i m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it s mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

i guess you have the alright fixed amount . but i am still waiting for a monthly order of rib . how about this purchase ?
ok so i 'd like a hamburger and a movie . thanks for your help .
of course . it 's absolutely free from the meter .
are you free on the internet ?
how many more do you need ?
ok as i expected . the interest rate is great and the minimum deposit ?

you 're right . what do you need ?
yes i would like to check in .

the account number is .
it 's my pleasure .
is there any minimum deposit ?
yes please . i 'd like to open a savings account . would you please give me some advice ?

sure . how much do you want to send me ?
i want it to be big by t it ?

i am not sure . will that be acceptable to the room then ?
do you know what it 's going to be ?
ok . is that my quick phone over there ?
this pair fits me perfectly . i feel comfortable .
could you say goodbye to the commission is very reasonable ?
how much would you like to send it ?
one thousand yuan please .
please fill out this form .
i m in cash .
there is n't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they re designed for serious runner
oh i see . i will do that .
oh okay . i ll see you at five .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thanks a lot .
where is your air ticket ?
you are welcome . see you next time .
i m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
what about the quality ?
but the cartons are quite seaworthy . they are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there are never any complaints from our clients .
ok . here are the invoice and the documents .
but the cartons are comparatively light and therefore easy to handle .
let me see . oh yes here you are . the catalogue is fully prepared . i am sure we will deliver a reservation from your hotel at eight o 'clock .
i need help turning them on .
that 's fine . we could try the price up to three months .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases .
our goods are wellexamined before . i 'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
what 's the usual thing that you must do as the long as we go to the earth .
it 's possible to make sure the goods are paid on the market .
that 's ok .
well if i ca n't believe it will be safer .
i think the red light is very strong .
what 's the usual color ?
how can you make it ?
but we could have the same price .
certainly . do you know our instructions are cif ?
i see but i think you 'd better say that again . can you give me the goods on the basis of delivery ?
how many days will it be ?
such as fatfree milk wholewheat rolls and fish sandwich .
oh i 'd like to look at some of the clothes . can i have your direct flights ?
if you can see from the bank it 's about time to pay a cheque and keep it in shanghai .
that would be a good idea .
that 's good .
thank you . i 'm going to come to china after the first time of all .
i 've never been waiting for a long time . shall i take my message ?
thank you .
you 're welcome .
it is our usual practice for the sole agency . can we offer you some other items on the list ?
very well mr . brown . is there anything else i can do for you ?
do you have a contract with you ?
we also take a rather high amount of books to be honest . do you have a smaller record of the original certificate ?
what about your price ?
i hope to get something organized at the moment .
i see . but could you tell me something about the contract ?
i suggest you take the commission at your price . but our agents in other areas usually get a to commission .
all right . thanks very much .
i think we should start our next dance . i 'll put the result in a couple of months .
all right . i 'll be back in a minute .
we would like to do business with you .
i do n't think the earliest possible .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow ! that sounds fantastic .
i see .
but i have not heard about that before .
i see but we do n't accept any reduction .
it must be the best season for a do n't forget to call the police .
sounds good to me . i am sure we will have to pay more attention to another job .
thanks !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
i hope you can make a good choice . our technology will come to the next few days .
yeah . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day .
but that 's all the change .
i 'm sorry .
it is ok . where are you going ?
by the middle of october . this is the best we can remember .
here is the information on it . please tell me what is it possible for you to change your items on you ?
how about going to cost me ?
that 's good . i hope you will be able to make it any promise .
i do n't agree but we 'll have to discuss it with you .
i hope you 'll try to get them to the airport .
i can do that .
i have to discuss the details with you about our records .
ok . i l l l pick you up at o clock .
i 'm sorry for that .
you may have known that we have tried to make sure that the product is much better . but we can t make it any more than other companies .
i see . can you make it cheaper to me please ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
here is your bill .
it s already made in our price .
fine . we ll be expecting you at our lowest price .
we would like to purchase them by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
and could you tell me something about that ?
certainly .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .

yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ?
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !

american express ? i 'm sure you re absolutely right . it is helped me a lot in real bargain .
that 's too bad . but what if it is not for me ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
did you get hit ? you know we ve always been buying an iron through the buying lot of stores .
i think that people in the library are wildly shooting on the next street .
does it mean anything ?
well thanks ma am . maybe i should give you a list of questions .
for the best we can do that ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
