i beg your pardon ?
i see . here is the money .
i do n't know . the ones who stole my uncle 's motorcycle were pretty good .
yeah me too .
but you still have to turn it on .
do i have to get in the haunted house ?
my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us !
no . i 'll wait .
you ve had a great time !
it 's all right . anything else ?
all right . we 'll get it .
what does that mean ?
yes i did . i 'm in the mood for it .
i 'll have to put up with it .
she asked me to beef in a restaurant .
wow ! this is the lucky thing we have .
that 's her job .
i 've got a point there . it 's a custom and good manners to play .
no why did n't i ?
cool down harry ! what are you really mad about ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i <unk> upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
. . . i 'm sure you can make it . and anyway what 's the problem ?
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff .
really ?
i promise i 'll be late .
no . it is the first time .
here is the money .
sure . are you sure ?
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes .
that 's just what i wanted .
what about his hair ?
did you ?
yes i will get outside . thanks for calling . bye !
thanks .
who s calling ?
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
ok goodbye .
it 's .
here you are .
i 'm sorry . we do n't have any larger size . would you like a larger size ?
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the saucepan the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . here you are .
thank you .
yes go ahead .
why not ?
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
then what should i do now ?
you are welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
sorry i didn t know .
when is the next meeting ?
you know what things get .
boy you know i know .
but what are they ?
right . there will be a traffic jam .
it 's my pleasure .
my roommate always wants me to give her a speech .
why ?
it 's a little small .
i do n't know . why did you ask that ?
two people were injured .
that 's great . give me the landscape of the triumphal for the background .
i do n't know .
what 's wrong with it ?
they re incredibly selfish . they re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
yes sir . where are you going ?
may i suggest a limo ? it 's nice to pamper yourself .
all right . got it .
we have a selection of dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
i 'm in a hurry .
thank you .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
thank you !
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the officelicense to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we can do that on the way home so we don t have to wait to carry it the whole time .

what 's the matter ?
the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
why not ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i 'm sorry .
it says smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
well there s nothing else .
i do n't know what to say .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
no i would n't think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on a diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
your mom please .
what 's the fare please ?
ok i ll show you where i am .
i recommend we meat .
all right .
okay . wait a minute please .
sure what 's up ?
by the way do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable .
ah yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's right .
ah that 's right .
what about the numbers ?
that s okay .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
are you chubby ?
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
what happened ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .

it 's a long way to go .

yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number .

they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
it 's very exciting .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .

mom do n't worry about it !
hi rita i m just looking for a pair of shoes . i won t be here for long .
why not ? when i go shoe shopping i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
that s my problem . i don t have a lot of options .
so how much do you want to pay ?
what do you want it for ?
how can you repair them ?
well first of all i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
you re in the right store . if they don t have it no one will .
in that case i will take it .
no i m not sure . i think about mph right ?
you 're not sure ? you were going in miles per hour ! that 's mph over the legal speed limit ! have you been drinking ?
no not at all .
then how can you explain your behavior ?
well i guess i just wasn t paying attention to the speedometer .
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
um because i was busy talking to my friend .
on a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and eating some food i had too many distractions .
that s definitely true . i m going to have to give you a ticket . please remember to drive more carefully next time .
i ll look in the paper .
a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop .
here s an interesting ad for rent . twobedroom unfurnished house <unk> yard onecar garage . pets ok .
for what ?
the rent is each month .
when is the place available ?
it s available now and it s got a very good location . you won t be far from work .
oh you didn t know that apartments here are considered valuable even if they are small and crowded ?
of course i had heard about that but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here .
i don t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
yeah but so what ! i m proud to live in the world s most exciting city . and the salaries here are the highest in the nation too .
sure . walk along this road and turn left at the second intersection .
what are you going to need ?
i 'd like to withdraw some money from my bank account .
what can i do for you ?
what 's your major ?
how long will it take me to get there ?
it only takes about half an hour .
that 's a good idea . let 's go .
the only problem is that i am going to miss you .
we would like to live in the suburbs .
does it close at first ?
now that s a plus !
.
and how much would you like to change ?
what about the kitchen ?
you can get cheap carpets easily .
how much is it ?
but thank you very much all the same .
how many children do they take ?
i 'm clipping coupons .
wo n't that be expensive ?
yes i would like to try something new .
could you drive me to the airport ?
no thanks .
i want to have a try later .
i hope you 'll like it .
so what 's the problem ?
it 's so much better than mine .
where should i be located ?
is it a young car ?
since you 're a high season we have n't had a high model .
are you sure ?
right . that old one ?
hold on . i think it s a nice view .
do you mean a maximum discount ?
okay . the main thing is that there anything else i can do for you .
is there any minimum deposit ?
about half an hour .
do you like coffee ?
what happened to her ?
yes i wish i could .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
everything seems to be here .
oh shut up . please be quiet .
i was hoping to get a expensive apartment .
it 's on the first floor in front of you .

so what does this plan include ?
well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .

what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything .
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
yes sir . but this is n't my first time .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got strappy sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes <unk> .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an <unk> shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a closedtoe shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i find slingbacks very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
what size are you looking for ?
size .
here we are . how does it fit ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my insoles . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they just don t make shoes like they ?
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then !
i ll tell you what i can get you some <unk> and we ll take it from there .
yay !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then <unk> pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a <unk> .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !
no thank you i am not interested .
please ma am if you could spare five minutes of your time i am sure we could find something that interests you !

i know where it is . where are you going ?

i will .
i think you 'll need to provide these days .
are you serious ?
do you want the most expensive suite ?
i like it but there is one problem .
well thank you very much .
i think it is something wrong with it .
what 's the problem ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?

are you serious ?
how much is it ?
i m happy to hear that .
i know he s going to be the next president .
the rent is each month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
you spend a lot of money .

my exam .
then let s go and see .
how much more ?
i 've got one here . it 's a month .
ok mr . horn see you tomorrow at .
i had a home inspection before .
i had no idea .
can you understand what the cost of the home inspection is ?
the owner said it was horrible !
the owners might not be aware of everything .
i can t get it .
if the owners are going to be happy to give you a call .
what 's that ?
a home inspection is a very outdated kitchen . is there anything else i can do for you ?
at . . on friday morning .
will that be all ?
are you serious ?
i really want to paint the walls but i really want to paint the walls .
alright . we will take it .
and if the furniture is still available ?
that will be fine .
and i need to think about it . where can i find something ?
i would like to make an appointment for o clock .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
that s better . now what ?
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the driveway .
i got it . don t worry .
remember no <unk> this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
here is the fare and keep the change please .
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal !
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy some souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
well first i 'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
i 'm sorry sir this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .

they look delicious .
it 's a deal .
did you bring that money ?
i really feel bad about it .
you 're good !
wow ! you are so lucky !
i am just thinking about getting up .
that 's because you cheated .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara is just a friend .

it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it 's too salty .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no she has big enough eyes .
i know what she would <unk> whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all ?
that will be all .

let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?

what would you do without me ?
what else ?
i want to have a haircut .

what about that one over there ?
do you like this color ?
if you 're not . but i think it 's much better than the old one .
oh tom . he looks very nice .
sure . it 's not a formal shirt .
what size would you like ?
i like the bamboo ones .
here 's the ninedragon screen .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
yeah that 's the only thing we can do .

i thought this was the right stop .
yeah you are right ! thank you !

thank you . please take a look at your passport and sign it .
yeah you 're so thoughtful .
you know i 'm feeling much better . i 'm just relaxing . i think i 'm in shape .
what are you talking about ? are you all out of school ?
i do n't want to .
you never know what really drives me like ?
thank you very much .
is there anything else i can do ?
a training course ?
he 's going to london .
what about school ?
i m twice a week now .
could you tell me how to play football ?
that 's not a problem . seeing you then .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
do you have some special events in your country ?
my goodness ! what if something happened ?
i like them .
well if you have any more questions just ask me .
thanks a lot .
that 's great . thank you .
that 's a good idea . let me see .
who are you going to stay with ?
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i had a wonderful time .
me too .
i took a bachelor 's degree in economics .
did you feel any young ?
to be honest i like all of them except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young he seems like an old person . he 's so boring .
i think so too . i do n't like him either . well who do you like best ?
she speaks english very well .
i feel she has a good ability .
she 's in the hospital with my dad .
what does she want to do there ?
you are absolutely right . she was a psycho .
you are right . she said she d be very <unk> .
yes she has a lot of homework .
that 's great !
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what are you talking about ? you re making me out ! what are you talking about ?
thanks .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
no i already did .
hey look at her . it 's all my fault ! is there anything i can do for you ?
i did .
oh did n't you tell me something about your teacher ?
she was a beautiful girl .
oh that 's a great time .
i got a character part in the overall department .
what 's the difference ?
would you like to go with me on the phone ?
you are right i 'll change it .
yes i have .
in a few months i 'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . .
of course . you can have her own eyes .
do you think so ?
not really . but anyway we have to get married once we get married .
well . you can get something to drink later .
i 'm trying to find her something .
did you go to a school or something ?
not as long as i can .
that sounds like fun .
which one do you like best ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
how long have you been married ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
that 's right . anything else ?
do you like it ?
in private schools .
are there any schools where my parents are located ?
oh in america .
are there any other advantages ?
we did n't actually teach in the public schools .
did you go to a public school or a private school ?
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it s cheap and easy to use .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i would like to return this book .
anything else ?
i sure do .
all right . now you can take your case away .
i 'm sorry .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
what would you like for a drink ?
it 's going to be .
how much do i owe ?
why not ?
i won t do that .
i need to take a few classes .
may i have your name please ?
i have it right here .
what s the problem ?
i don t want to .
ok it 's a date then !
then what do i do ?
would you like any cash back ?
that s it ?
i 'm sorry sir this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
thank you .
i would like to transfer money .
you will need to apply for one .
ok . i need to see some id .
you can do it right now .
i d like to do that .
how much would you like ?
do you have an application form with you ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
when will my passport be ready ?
about half an hour .
i think you will like it . by the way when can i get it back to my hotel ?
do you need a spot here or off campus ?
i m not sure .
thanks a lot .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the night ?
i park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .
yikes ! temple city .
what curb colors ?
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
it 's on the fourth floor .
i should have it done now .
i needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .
all right . here you go .
here 's your receipt . have a nice day .

no but i 'll make sure someone helps me out the paperwork .
i 'm going to do that . have you ever been there before ?
thank you very much .

sure .
mr . robson i 'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
me too . when do you leave ?
sure . what are you going to do ?
at what time ?
i forgot about it .
sure what else can i help you ?
yes that 's right .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
great ! would you like something to drink ?
remember that you are in college now not high school .

it 's very kind of you to say so .
i see .
i really appreciate it .
how much time do you have ?
sure . you 're doing a very good job .
this is the first thing i want .
do you have any other questions ?
i do n't know what to tell .
have you made a good choice ?
there are several things you need to consider . i 'll do everything you need to take care of . i hope you can do it well .
excellent . can i have your name and phone number ?
yes . and it 's a very simple one . you can also find parttime job too .
i 'm completely lost . let 's go !
yes i 'm going to europe on business and i need to purchase some traveller 's cheques .

i feel the same way .
well in the case maybe you can be more understanding .
anything wrong with it ?
yes . i know that . but can you give him a rough idea ?
could you wait a moment ?
why not ?
oh my god !
i can understand that .
i bet he is . he domed his own life .
what 's that ?
what does he want to do ?
that 's funny . i did n't know it .
yeah that 's not true . let 's go .
what is good for you ?
really ? i am glad to hear that . when will he do anything then ?
yes . he does . his wife is a great older than he does .
but he is a senator now .
yes . you can t be serious .
are you crazy ?
how old is he now ?
and he was in prison right ?
well that 's enough .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
oh yeah . you must have heard her .
i am free tomorrow . can you make it tomorrow ?
did you get home ?
i had a bad day yesterday .

i also have the same feeling .

what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .

mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that 's alright . it was n't my fault .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i 'd like to enrich my knowledge and the air in the summer .
it sure is .
what ?
that is nice .
yes . you are a heavy smoker .
thank you very much .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid fingerpointing when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
you need to print your name on this list .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much .
you 're right . we need to do something too .
i heard her boyfriend 's married .
what does she like to do with her ?
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks honey . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and get it done !
is this your first year in the company ?
are you kidding ?
that s right .
of course it is .
ok .
no . but i am here .
when did you say goodbye ?
i m sorry to hear that .
are you kidding me ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
who knows !
mary i 'll be glad to hear that .
what did you say to him ?
thanks i think so . i must be shy .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take <unk> during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
thank you for your love .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
it is at the north of forbidden city on the central axis of beijing .
what is that ?
i hope so . i 'm looking for some material for a paper i 'm writing and i 'm not quite sure where to look .
what 's it for ?
pardon ?
he does n't like to see his face .
i bought it a couple days ago .
how long do you plan to go ?
here you are .
i am sorry sir . you bought it weeks ago and you can only refund it in one week .
ca n't you give me a discount ?
what were you reading ?
i know what you mean .
i 'd be glad to .
where did you learn ?
and what are you going to do ?
yes . then i must lose weight .
what 's wrong ?
what would you like to do ?
well i ca n't tell you . why do n't you say that ?
how nice ! what are you doing ?
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some languageexchange program ?
what is it ?
it s for a job . it looks perfect for you .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool . what time ?
what 's the brand ?
no problem .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
well you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and made me disappointed .
oh cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do n't you like to know just now ?
yes i remember .
it 's very quiet and peaceful .
me too . let 's go dutch .
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
yes i like .
what is it ?
oh thank you .
why do n't you have any money for the bus ?
no problem . i am still in a hurry . could you wait a minute ?
about a private vehicle ?
really ?
yes . you can say that again .
yeah i saw that .
which one is it ?
that 's good .
hmm . . .
but i heard it 's a great movie . what did you want to see ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
can you use my computer ?
that sounds like a good idea .
everybody is buying them .
wish me luck here .
i see . then what about you ?
we are having dinner with my friends .
so what are you thinking of doing ?
thank you . i 'll take one .
ok no problem . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i 'll try it . what would you like ?
how would you like your steak done ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides you can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
it 's just we 've been planning to go the beach for a while and we decided we could both make it this weekend . then out of nowhere she called me up said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip .
that sounds pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some afterdinner wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in <unk> . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
what 's the occasion ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
that 's what i want . thanks .
cheers .
i am . what about you ?
i am going to the airport .
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
yes ?
no not a problem .
what 's the problem ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
how many members are you talking about ?
how can i go there to have a taste ?
and he is trying to hide in his life .
did you hear him ok ?
that 's terrible . he ll be all right .
he did n't say anything .
what did you think of it ?
what ?
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
to in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what happened ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i do n't think i refused it .
how did you notice the gift ?
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that . i think it 's worse .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i am afraid it 's supposed to rain .
i guess i 'll have to call it now .
sorry about that .
are you sure ?
i can tell you the truth . it 's not like i was wondering if you 'd like .
can you wait a few minutes ?
well they 're probably going to have to cut the vegetables but they do n't have any meat .
okay . i 'll have a try .
have you brought your coat yet ?
oh she didn t know you were a student in school .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light <unk> conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
i 've bought a lot of tickets and i do n't know how to play the games .
yes it 's still open .
i think the cause is terrible . i do n't want to watch a cold .
ok i m really going to make it .
are you sure ?
yes it 's a bit early in the morning .
well not probably . that 's why we have n't lived in a motel .
the y . h . a . mun . the youth hostel 's association .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
then i do n't know !
it was exciting .
go ahead .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
it 's huge .

i 'll do that too .
hi bob . what 's up ?
i do n't think so . michael .
oh no .
what ?
yeah . i know .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
oh my god !
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
what about his hair ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and lie around and his situation .
i think my kitchen will be fine .
my pleasure . how about you ?
what are you going to get ?
i 'd like to go alone .
i 'm very busy these days . it seems i can never finish my work .

i have no idea .

i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
not really .
oh do you see them ?
yes i have .
it 's a great opportunity .
what do you think of his taste ?
when did you hear it ?
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
of course . here it is .
are you sure ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
is there anything else ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
you are so thoughtful .
i 'm sure you will .
i will !
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
what happened ?
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light <unk> conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
what are they ?
as long as you can get it fixed .
great idea !
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking .
really ?
it 's affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
i guess .
no . he didn t .
i think so too .
do you want me to go shopping ?
i grew up in africa so i learned quite a few different languages .
here you are .
after a while <unk> .
ok . bye .
we go to the cafeteria .
the attendants fill the tank clean the windscreen and add some air to the tires .
it 's fun .

what does it look like ?
well here is the money .
can i help with everything ?
i m going to the hospital .
what kind of music do you like ?
no it 's just online .
do n't you like it ?
and i can make enough money .
are you serious ?
really ? i have no idea of it .
generally speaking cantonese food is rather light shanghai food is heavy and spicy .
and i would like to book a table for six at this evening .
of course .
and i 'll make beef very good .
yes i like collecting things .
well i just need to sleep .
i do n't know . i think it 's much better than mine .
i see .
i ca n't stand to any more .
what do you mean ?
i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there 's anything she needs to make it easier ?
it 's such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
really ? that 's great !
but i . . .
yes . i know what you mean .
great . let 's go .
of course . it 's a popular game among young girls .
what about your major ?
yes they have . i can watch them now .
sure .
well you have to . i do n't know what you 're talking about .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
let 's see .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
it 's a great opportunity .
i 'm not sure . he did n't know what his problem is .
what does he look like ?
we can leave him a message and give him a call .
will that work out ?
forget it .
really ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
how about this one ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
but i do n't blame you for working days .
i know but some people say that they ca n't .
well maybe you can ask her to go alone .
i beg your pardon ?
what a pity ! i hope you 'll do well .
i know but you must feel much better now .
that 's all right .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
well thanks .
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include <unk> that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
but i 'm not working very hard .
she 's pretty serious .
look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that 's why that car stops .
yes and i love the gift .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
which is it ?
this job provides full medical dental and disability .
great !
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
that 's great . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well but i 'm a little bit slow in the process of digital products .
really ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
that 's interesting . for example it 's so popular that a lot of fat .
really ?
i like painting sailing watching football and talking to you .
it 's a good idea . you will be swimming next week .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
how about at the subway station ?
when did you say ?
me too .
ok . bye !
i think it 's a good idea . where is the villa ?
i see . well in that case we can get the apartment better . but first you should n't need to worry about it .
whatever you say . i 've really had enough money .
maybe you 're right . but what 's the point of it ?
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
oh gosh ! i have to admit that it 's fantastic .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm doing fine thanks .
lin is a common chinese last name .
i 'm glad to meet you .
yes . is it easy to get around ?
what section did you work in ?
ok i will .

i see . what was it about ?
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
you 're kidding . the story and acting were outstanding .
maybe .
but i heard the box office rose up to million in the first week .
is this a long ride ?
do n't worry . i 'm much better now .
are you sure you do n't like it ?
i appreciate it very much .
no wonder you are named shopaholic .

at least half an hour .
yes sunday sounds fine .

sure . what time do you want to go ?
sure . where shall we meet ?
that 's all right .

i do n't know .

great . thank you . anything else ?
what do you think we should do ?
don t you re right .
is it cold in winter ?
what 's the weather like in your country ?
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
hey darling i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
are they sweet ?
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .

that 's an interesting job ! what is it ?
that 's not the same . i never paid for hotel souvenirs .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
really ? what 's he doing ?
he is in his late thirties .
what makes you like to drink ?
i like wearing shorts in summer .
i ca n't believe it . this city is quite warm and warm .
have you ever had a motorcycle ?
i think so . last time i saw it on tv .
what would you do with them ?
yeah . something like that ?
i m sure it will .
what is the biggest product ?
sports .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
you are right .
i like taking photos .
what is your favorite sport ?
yes but i like it very much .

not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like taking photos .
what kind of people do you like ?
light music and classic music .
how about samba ?
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
sometimes i 'm not used to playing games .
yes . but it only costs money .
i like to play computer games read books go shopping and play .
that 's great . we are going to have a walk .
it s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you mary . you look so nice .
what a shame !
where ?
that sounds like fun .
let me tell you the story . in patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
i think you should do this thing .
whatever am i .
yes .
i guess i 'll take a cold .
what the matter ?
to be honest i do n't even know when i was a child .
did you play musical ?
it 's not all that bad . i 'll try it on .
i 'm going to the hospital .
yeah it 's nice but its so red because of air pollution .
the car will never take long .
what a beautiful place !
it 's a little far from here .
oh i see .
i know . thank you .

i did n't know that .
i may have a try .
ok go ahead .
why ?
are you sure ?
it 's just how you want it ?
oh great ! did you feel like basketball ?
yes .
i really do n't want to see you there .
that 's how you did n't get hurt .
have a good rest .
very good . i 'm not ready .
i will hold you for a moment .
wow ! this thing is great ! i love it .
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
that 's too bad .
his sister had a car accident last week .
what happened ?
he was alone .
i do wish i could lose weight .
that s right .
oh that 's all ?
what happened ?
i beg your pardon ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
oh . i just got back .
did he see his face ?
so what did he do ?
what 's the matter ?
it did n't happen again .
well as we say the rest is history . . .
then he is really lucky .
it must be one of those .
oops . well i am just not sure he wants us to do something .
i know !
i was too scared when i saw the gun .
just fine and you ?
are you kidding ? why did you say so ?
no i 'm still single .
i have some friends who might be able to help you find a job .
yeah . it 's amazing .
that sounds like a good idea .
yes we do .
that sounds like a good idea .
to be honest i have n't really heard of that . what 's the matter with that ?
you have to pay for it ?
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
why ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
do n't worry about it .
what 's the matter ?
that 's right . anything else ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
you are a good friend .
i ca n't figure out which dress to wear .

but thank you very much all the same .
thanks for letting me know .
yes .
me too . what did you want me to do ?
it 's all right .

yes . i think so .
are you sure ?
what is it ?
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s <unk> just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the <unk> so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in malaysia .

thank you .
you re welcome .
great .
what time is it ?

absolutely .
great idea .
thanks . and you ?
i went to the kennedy center .
i 'm not sure . i 've bought it for several months .
how old is he ?
i remember now . it 's nice to see you again .
i 'm not disciplined enough i guess .
she is absolutely wonderful .
ok .
how about this one ?
i know that .
i see .
oh . . .
what color ?
she has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
i ca n't bear it . it 's just a regular diet .
thanks for saying that . you are one of the expert .
you 're welcome .
thanks .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
nothing . but he is in a bad mood today .
so what 's on ?
yes . i am .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
well what kind of stuff do you want ?
i have no idea . what about you ?
all right .
how about ?
ok .
thank you .
not at all .
goodbye .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
thank you . please call us again if you can promise me .
goodbye and have a good time .
do n't worry about it .
goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun .
how about milan ?
i have no idea .
i do n't think so .
i have n't eaten anything in my room .
thanks ! these are beautiful . you should n't have !
thank you . same to you .
not yet . i have n't decided yet .
have you ever been there ?
the same to you !
the same to you !
you are welcome .

he is in his late thirties .
i forgot it .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
have you figured out who you re going to vote for ?
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
they 're blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect the anyway to be true anyway .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
i 've already voted .
really ? that 's excellent . i 'll also take it .
yuan please .
that seems to have everything done for you . i 'll take the insurance and get back to you later . thanks for your help .

very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in haitian district where there are lot of universities .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thank you . how are you ?
not so well . i 've been very busy lately .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it .

i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light <unk> conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
ok .
i 'm not sure .
uh . . . i can help .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
oh i see . thank you .
i hope that it does n't rain .
poor fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the st april april april fool 's day .
you forgot all about it did n't you ?

th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
how long will it take ?
what about ?
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was exciting .
what was it about ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes . it 's wonderful .
of course . i didn t .
are you kidding me ?
i guess i was stunned for a moment then i quickly ran away to get help .
i 've got it . how 's john going on ?
yes . it was wonderful . thank you for all the time .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
for me the times of the times you use .
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
really ? why ?
ok let s go .
they are . there are so many excellent candidates out there .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
what did you buy ?
that 's easy .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan huan huan huan huan .
but i love them very much .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
it s a lot harder than i imagined .
the weather is wonderful here .
yes but there are many cities where it is .
i can see it from london .
there are many seats in the rear mezzanine .
yeah you 're right .
they are .
not much the clever thing .
really ?
that 's right .
i bought you one last year . it 's a good one . is n't it ?
i like them very much . i think they 're a good movie .
no it 's the first time i 've been here .
why is that ?
perfect !
i m glad to hear that . would you like to join me ?
no . but i hear a lot .
yeah . i 've still got a few there .
oh did you play table tennis ?
oh great . it was a great game .
yes i do .
well . we ve invested in a lot of money before .

yeah i had a skydiving accident over the weekend .
what s wrong with it ?
have you had anything to drink ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do ?
rise and shine sleepyhead .
but i have nothing to do .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your <unk> opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
i have to file a report at the police station .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped <unk> .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
okay .
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .

it s for a book .
oh that s a nice idea . well it s fine if you take our picture .

i know you have a tight schedule so i wo n't take up more of your time . have a good evening .
yes it looks interesting .
you 're right . i love it very much .
it must be old .
at least more than years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?
frightened ? you must be joking .

i hope she ll understand .

thanks . it 's very kind of you .
a glass of white wine .

thank you .
we really love this position .
i thought you were right .
hi jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working a lot of overtime lately .
how about tomorrow night ?
oh that sounds great !
no you are not going to have you mr . white ?
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .

ok . bye .
bye .
i am glad you could come mr . liu .
thanks .
i 'm glad you like it .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i ll just be glad to .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
what do you teach ?
what s the problem ?
may i know what you do ?
oh ! i 'd love to .
yes why ?
will you be staying at
of course . well let me know if you need any more help .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
thank you for your hospitality .
this friday evening ?
it s no problem . what about next time ?
as soon as possible .
no problem . see you later .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'm trying to find a job in sound engineering .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is <unk> chan ?
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i m never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi peter . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard .
sure . join my class next week .
hey ! it 's a nasty treat . you do n't have to work !
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
what s your proposal now ?
what 's that ?
can you tell me what the requirements are ?
what 's the trouble ?
are you going to continue with the scholarship ?
used to . but now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . but kobe is the upcoming superstar now .
well to begin with i was born and raised in america .
i ca n't figure it out . here 's my card .
what are you talking about ?
maybe . will you find something else ?
that 's no problem . i 'm sure you 'll have a credit card .
i think that by doing something like that we should be thinking about it when we are active .
but will you lose any trouble ?
yes i 'm sorry . i 've gone through the phone for the last half hour .
you must have had something to do with her .
really ? are you sure ?
i know what you 're going to do now . but i feel better now .
what are you worried about ?
well why don t you use a local sim card ?
what are you talking about ?
that 's the purpose of the meeting .
what about these people ? they are much better !
not much .
coming .
sounds like fun ! when will it be ?
well you know it 's a time to get together with all your family .
you 're right . but i saw a ghost ?
as a matter of fact we are a dependable people .
then i 'll have to work on the internet .
are they safe ?
that 's right .
i do n't like this one .
i did n't know that before .
well i grew up in africa so i learned quite a few different languages .
i have n't decided yet .
so what are you going to do ?
no not really . why do you like it ?
yes it 's going to be fun .
where are you from ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
you don t think so ? i m going to live with you !

.
are there any other seats ?
i don t think it s expensive .
o . k . i 'll get it done right now .
i ll get them for you at once . and could i file the report for you ?

thank you mr . johnson . you ve made a guaranteed reservation at the guangzhou xx hotel from april th to th for nights . if you can t arrive as schedule please inform us before p . m . hank you for calling and we look forward to serving you
no problem . it s nothing .
it s a good idea . what s it like ?
i did n't know . i 'm so touched .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
well have you ever tried then ?
it 's important to know .
yes . it 's one of the best .
it 's famous for its arts and crafts .
it 's amazing !
how so ?
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share .
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards in the east they would even read tea leaves !
i 'm not sure .
i 've been working here too .
alright . will you make it ?
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light <unk> conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
what are the difference ?
i do n't know what to say . .
what are the charges going on ?
of course i do . i 'm pretty excited about it .
you need to keep it at .
well in that case i guess maybe you should be more understanding .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming .
remember my sister ?
nice to see you too .
thank you very much . i ve had a lot of fun .
what did you get ?
you ve had to give me a chance .
a bar of soap ! are you serious ?
it s a special ingredients . i can put a lot of things in it .
really ? how much is it ?
yes . it s so nice .
it 's a oneyear lease .
and how about your spanish ?
right . that s fantastic .
yeah i like that too .
yes it is .
what room does the bedroom have ?
i thought it would be a bit difficult .
next week .
have you talk to her about it ?
when will you give me a raise ?
do you really think so ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
i do n't like it . but i ca n't wait to try it .
oh you didn t have to . .
i bet you 're right .
thank you for saying so .
how about some korean food ? do you like it ?
what am i supposed to do ?
sorry i can t .
nice !
i 'm still hungry .
may i try it then ?
is n't that great ?
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
he must be very happy .
that will make it fun .
i thought so .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
it does n't matter . i 'm sure you 'll like this . it 's easy and it does n't play too much time .
it 's my pleasure .
we provide free training every month .
excellent . we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let 's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let 's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
it 's free of charge .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
maybe it is right . i 'll find my shadow too .
yes i like collecting things .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
fine thanks . how are you ?
do n't worry . it 's my treat .
i 'm impressed . i thought you 'd be a good time .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i know ! but mrs . smith said she was the best teacher .
can n't be better .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
fine thank you .
that 's great . let me have a look .
boy you 're got such a crush on her do n't you ?
when is it ?
you said it . that 's my fault !
i like playing cards .
yeah i told you that it 's been a long time .
i 'm not keen on talking about michael milliken the bond king .
why ?
bingo !
it 's hard to say .
the holiday i love it .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
the sky is clear the sun outside . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there s a nice cool breeze so it s not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
thank you ! how long does it take to be ?
i m surprised to hear that . i thought both of them were good .
maybe . i can teach them how to use them .
great !
oh it was terrific . i had my favorite book last week .
perhaps you should also get a computer program to play .
not at all . but there are too many jobs in the university .
well i 've decided to give it a try .
okay i know .
you 're right . thank you for your help .
no problem .
uh . see you later .
of course not . but he was really young .
i wish i could . one moment please .
i hope to study english literature . but my major is english .
thank you for your compliment .
you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
what 's your favorite writer ?
what else do i need to do ?
it deserves its name .
oh . i 'm impressed .
let 's make it a secret .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and it 's huge .
what 's it about ?
ok tell me about it .
not sure . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look .
i see . it must be very interesting . do you want it ?
i 'd like to buy one .
you 're lucky .
oh i see . when do you think i 'll be able to exercise ?
yes . i know something about school .
what is there ?
what 's your problem ?
here 's my visa credit card .
they 're almost ready .
ok . here it is .
what else have you got ?
what do you think about the internet ?
can you tell me how to use the computer ?
we can take it from there .
the food there is actually pretty good .
i see . you 're done .
they do a good job .
ok i will wrap them for you .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
who s that ?
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
i know . maybe i do n't like milk .
you like the food there ?
yes i do .
what s wrong with that ?
no ! i haven t ! what are you thinking of ?
yeah . you can find hundreds of animals here .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
oh he 's and in the past few months he 's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he 's running around with the wrong crowd .
what kinds of sports do you like ?
like this one ?
that is great ! do you know our company is <unk> ?
yes .
i know !
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i know . but how can you do that ?
yes . there is also a western mountain guide .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
would you like to go by car ?
well what 's the problem ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me ?
no problem .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all kinds of movies .
well do n't get a lot of watch .
well there 's nothing special you can think of .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
maybe you are right .
really ?
what are you going to do now ?
you 're telling me .
bingo !
look at that big tree over there .
oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right there .
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but you made me a decision .
smile i can t believe this for it s been years since we got married .
what type of movie is that ?
but i am not sure .
by the way what 's your favorite program ?
that 's great .
i have the same idea .
what 's your favorite kind of food do you like ?
yeah . it s amazing .
no problem . good luck .
really ? that 's a good idea .
the <unk> is a little better .
sure . what are you thinking about ?
well what time ?
there 's a library right inside .
ok .
who was it ?
really ? but she s not a fine movie .
i am not a big fan of her .
really ? that 's wonderful !
it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
is n't this a good player ?
what did you think of the film ?
absolutely .
oh i like him very much .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that scans all <unk> so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of spamunwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star s private live in recent years .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
<unk> really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said .
thanks a lot . i ll do my best .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your first book
thanks a lot .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here .
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about or places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an <unk> program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several <unk> the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i don t often use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it s harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
you re right . i love being in my city but i hate being so far .
people can have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
it 's true .
of course . i m a teacher .
i have no idea .
do you need to take a holiday ?
well . perhaps three months later .
well if there s nothing else i think we ve settled everything .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
and it 'll have to be done .
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
i ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his <unk> ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . . .
how about this . when you finish the book .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
well this is the thing i wanted to do .
what a pity !
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
yes you are right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
that 's great . thank you .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
why not ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath please . do you smoke mr . smith ?
our cousin pete ! she has a <unk> nose sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he has also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will <unk>
all right ! what about you fred ?
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
all right . and here are the basic rules that you can see from the nurse at the back !
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be <unk> grateful . i bet you it will even <unk> mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it sure does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? i m going there .
ok kids here sa beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is this ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
where are the vegetables ?
is that so ?
where are the doctor ?
she is a famous actress .
are you talking about me ? i think i m ready for a minute !
yes . four ?
are we all going to have to choose one of our own table ?
all right bill . here s your daily exercise schedule . you are to jog before breakfast .
all right . anything else ?
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
well i m leaving tomorrow so i think we should sign up for it .
i heard that you might need some more help .
so it s a formal one ?
relax it was just a goat !

i m so sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad you like it .
that s great !
thanks a lot !
can i try that now ?
i 've been buying this place for several months and i love them .
you 're right ! i 'm going to ask !
that 's funny .
i suppose you re right .
i 'm just watching some television .
i know . i m really sorry .
what happened ?
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we ca n't very well run a light <unk> conference without any light bulbs can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
then walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
cheers !
i ve been working so hard lately .
what s he doing ?
ok .
are you going to have to wear those big shoes ?
hmm . . .
give me another chance .

what else can we do ?
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i have a good attitude my application was accepted .
congratulations !
well what are you going to do now ?

what kind of sports do you like ?
i have enough time . i just want to look at myself .
you 've got plenty of time to sleep .
i know .
but i exercise a lot .
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . .
what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
are you sure ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
i 've already been thinking about this for several months .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? what did it happen ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
what happened ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i said no i was his wife .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
yeah he should be there . anything else ?
yeah . we should be sure . anything else ?
you are kidding .
i think that it s all about me . one of the more that s all for me .
of course . i have tickets to london .
teachers ?
yeah why not ?
great ! do you know any spaces on campus ?
that s a good idea . but how can you stand working here ?
i know your parents do a good job .
not really . but i still need to learn a lot from it .
no i don t have any attention to . it s easy to keep fit .
i enjoy dancing and dancing .
nothing really .
hmm . . . i do n't know what you mean . that could be a better action movie .
good news . i 'm glad to hear that .
it 's a twobedroom one .
what are you talking about ?
if you are feeling better soon maybe i 'll stay in bed for a few days . it 's about o 'clock .
i wish it was a favorite movie .
what do they mean ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type .
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but we can change our working condition .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like avoiding <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no he did n't . it was his fault .
have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among him ?
well they had no reason for arresting me .
that seems right . do you think the deposit on this project ?
thank you .
it s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
well it was . .
really ?
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
great . you can reach me at .
you 're so kind .
ok .
your usual shirt and shoes .
it 's small but it 's rather plain . would you like to try it on ?
i know . would you like to go with me ?
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
it 's ok .
so what were you calling me about ?
did you ?
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i agree with you .
okay then i 'll pass it for you .
you 're a light weight .
i 'll take it .
oh i know ! if i don t want to !
i am not sure about it .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
what about taking a walk in the neighborhood ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
you are so thoughtful .
i had my first cigarette when i was .
thanks . that 's a excellent idea . you know i already knew i 'd go .
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
i do n't know . but . .
supervisor . open the door .
thank you very much .
would you rather stay home ?
no problem .
did you buy something else ?
why not ?
i would n't mind a burger .
i 'm fine .
no . that 's not a good idea . i feel terrible . what are you going to do ?
oh right !
yes it is .
you did ? but don t you know how young people are !
really ? he 's so handsome .
no he won t .
i thought you were good at shooting !
but you should think about it .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm ready .
i have no idea .
what application materials would you like to wear ?
oh i forgot about it .
i see . could i have your name and phone number again ?
you said it .
i like spring . the days are long and the nights are short . the flowers in blew . we go on picnics
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . after the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
but that 's friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening are you ?
maybe i should ask my mother .
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
they did .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by to at the end of the first half .
wonderful !
anne ! how have you been ?
just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
i went on a business trip in beijing .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
i see . by the way when can i get a hand ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
two blocks down the street . it 's not far from here .
what 's the cost ?
no you do n't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then i 'll buy a watch .
what should i bring with me ?
at please .
ok i 'll bring you the message over there .
a party of .
are you traveling alone ?
er . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no . please feel free .
oh is it ?
you are welcome .
well he s a bit on the th . i ll be on the th floor .
i just lost my job .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of that . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
got it .
nice to meet you too .
ok . i 'll see you then .
ok . let s go .
oh yeah i worked there for two years .

and a storm blew our roof away .
emm . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having ?
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i had to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah . . . you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did .

oh yes . i often eat enough .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my manager is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . can you tell me what the interest rate is now ?
i feel a little tired .
can you fill it out ?
no he did n't .
never mind .
i was there for about three years .
all right .
it 'll be ok .
well suffer then . if i have to go to the dentist i have to go to the dentist .
i 'm afraid not .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
it sure does .
yeah i do n't mind it .
yeah . it won t be much but at least .
is there anything else ?
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they would have none of them .
that was an odd change of subject .
so what 's it about ?

my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
what 's in the winter ?
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
it would be a beautiful city .
wow !
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
okay now .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
cloudy in the morning overcast in the afternoon .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
hey look outside ! it 's started to drizzle !
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
not yet . why ?
what are you doing ?
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
how old is he today ?
it 's his th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .

sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do n't think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
classic .
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like to play the piano .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i think there 's a waste of television .
that s great . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to pay for their tv programs . besides the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence .
did you enjoy the movie ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
yes but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from germany .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where are you from ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm doing fine thanks .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i guess education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using money responsibly .
it was a nightmare .
oh no .
i have n't eaten anything all day .
. see you .
ok . see you later .
to tell you the truth i do n't have to worry about it .
yes . the cartons are very low .
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
i do n't know . it 's only a discount .
thank you so much .
i think they have enough harvests for the baby .
i agree . the government has banned price hikes in my country !

are you kidding me ?
is there anything else you can do ?
i 'll buy the boxes for you .

good question . i have to think about it .
i 'll pay for it .
i don t think so .
ok . by the way what can i do now ?
what about this one ?
that 's no problem . is there anything else i can do for you ?
where is the peeler ?
well do you want to play poker ?

could n't be better .
i could n't help you .
there are four people .
how many years have you lived there ?

that 's true . but the competition is very bad .
that 's an executive !
i think families are often more independent than dogs .
i hope your cat finds its way .

then what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
that 's great . thank you .
whose house is it ?
i do n't know you have a taste . hey do you like this ?

how 's your family ?
what 's your favorite movie ?
my dad will freak out if i tell you .
you 're really a light weight .
thanks a lot . goodbye .
well i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
see you .
let s go !
yes i do .
ok . let me see . he looks through the cds .
i 'm actually out of the internet so i do n't like shopping malls .
that 's a good idea . which charities will you learn ?
me too . i want to know more about you eg what 's your real name and what do you look like . .
that 's great .
i like to play the piano .
oh no !
when will you find out ?
that 's true . but what should i do ?
i don t know . i ll be late for the train .
where should i go then ?
i 'm not feeling well .
i wonder what happened .
it 's a job at an advertisement company .
there is a job right now .
yes i 've got a wrong number .
when we go ahead what kind of place are you looking for ?
thanks for letting me know !
i hope so too .
you 're welcome . bye .
i have many hobbies . i like almost all kinds of sports and i also like to listen to classical music .
there 's a good movie called summer in beijing .
how much do you want to spend ?
i like all kinds of movies .
i like it . well it 's a bit too scary .
oh i see .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
it 's a beautiful city .
i go to the movies .
yeah what s in your apartment ?
oh yes . what s up ?
you 'll have a try .
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
i ca n't wait to see them .
sure . if you need anything else i can help you let me know .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me ?
no problem .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all genres except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . let 's see it .
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of <unk> friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and bawling whole <unk> of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> you .
i got you . next time .
really ? where did you hear that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a kissass . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about rumba ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hiphop or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i know it 's painful .
what 's the weather like in spring ?
i guess so .
how can i turn them on ?
where are they ?
i see . let 's see .
i want to go abroad .
where are you from ?
i m great . what s more his wife is .
i will need it for three days .
really ?
i did n't think it was too cold .
would you like me to walk there ?
the one that stole a small plane in scotland .
that 's over there .
yes i did .
how long have you been ?
no .
what time are you going ?
i do n't know .
so what ?
i 'm afraid he did n't .
i can help you with that . you can take a wrong bus .
yes .
that 's true .
he has a yellow dress on and red shirt .
i would n't like to look at his face .
maybe .
oh yes .
no .
no the most important thing is that you should wear almost every year .
you 're right . i 'll get it .
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
it 's just a waste of cash !
then how about a salesman ?
i could not agree with you more . for us there are so many unhappy things and i am so bored however i got lots of fun from him .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space shuttles are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet humankind will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
is that right ?
france ? are you crazy ?
what s the difference ?
what do you mean ?
oh i see . thanks for your help .
yeah .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for .
here it is .
no i can t give it to you let you have it for . how about ?
. ?
here is the money .
i like ferris wheel more .
ok . let 's go . are you through now ?
i was just taking a break from work and it s broken . .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate .
when did you say ?
ok so here s the plan when we land run to gate !
fantastic ! thank you very much !
i work in a publishing house . how about you ?
what date will you need ?
it s a very cool job .
what are you going to do ?
i work at the polling place .
yes of course .
what 's the price ?
may i help you with something ?
read me the index number !
in my opinion it was very good for me .
what do you mean ?
well i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
do you ever get lonely living alone ?
i hope my make it a deal .
i think it 's time to get used to it .
my hair looks hideous .
i know . i 've lost some weight .
i was married for about three years .
then why do you say so ?
i have one now .
i remember now that they fell in love with each other and fight to divorce .
i 'm not sure .
you said it .
i have been married for three years .
can you speak any other languages ?
i 'm not sure he did n't say but he 's never listened to me .
thanks .
there are four people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical ?
we are identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete <unk> when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ?
i don t know much about him . he died when i was a baby .
sounds like it was meant to be .
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
i sure did . what 's it like ?
what were you writing ?
what 's that ?
sure . here it is .
not bad . he seems to be such a thing .
well they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration they decided to have a big feast for the natives giving thanks the land and everyone for the foods healthy and new lives .
i think he will come as well .
he 's tall and slim fairhaired .
ok . i 'll see what he 's . .
he was wearing a mask .
i can understand that .
he 's going to canada and to live with his son .
i was born in ohio but i spent most of my childhood in london .
what did you learn ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
they did . i lived there for a long time .
yes they do .
yeah .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
what school did you get ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
how much ?
yes . but i 'll let you know if i 've gone .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
i got a start .
that 's great ! congratulations !
yes i am . what about you ?
i see .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . what about you ?
i do n't know what they want to say .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
do you have many children ?
yes i do . i 'm already in a hurry . you know what ?
well that may be true . but how many people are there ?
that 's true . but as a woman i 'm glad that even though i don t want any children i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand i can t imagine what china would be like if there weren t a onechild policy !
i know what you mean . i have n't had one for a while now . if you do n't mind my wife would be a pet .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that 's great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
thanks for flattering me . you do n't have to quit my job . i 'm fine .
thanks for helping me . you are so kind .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
what about his hair ?
that s it ! that s the one i was thinking of !
you 've been promoted ?
i 'm not sure but probably about years . how about in your country ?
about five years . the more than that i was born in .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
congratulations .
he 's been doing fine .
he ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
i had mine when i was . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you re right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
is there a big generation gap between parents and their children ?
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you want to children ?
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
you re right . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
what kind of people do you prefer ?
i agree . you re absolutely right .
but i still need to get my license .
how so ?
you are right .
i guess you are right . maybe it s just hard to believe what i am worried about .
what do you think the designers are ?
well there are different kinds of people . we do n't have many differences .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill . i saw bill .
how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle of wine .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
how terrible !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest bedroom .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and <unk> them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it online if it online . you don t like buying things online do you ?
ok . i see .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
wait a minute . i need your name .
you too .

sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful <unk> for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
do n't worry . the flight is supposed to be delayed .
ok . let me repeat that back to you . that 's zero double seven eight seven three six seven three six seven three six double eight .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
that s okay .
no problem .
that would be great . there is more stop lights on that street .
i see . so what s the rent ?
sorry sir we do n't have a swimming pool but we do have swim stations .
what are you going to do ?
it s . . .
you can cook it . what s that ?
no . i have no idea .
do you want to send someone to fix it ?
oh thank you !
i see .
yes and they are all new .
and do i have to pay extra money ?
what shall we do then ?
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads on the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
i ll get them for you at once . and could i file the report for you ?
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?

hi i 'd like to book a table for this evening please .
how long will you be staying ?
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
thank you very much .
certainly .
that 's a reasonable price .
that 's fine . i 'll take it .
you re welcome . goodbye .
sure . it 's .
yes here you go .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
thank you very much .
i hope so .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm going to canada .
what are you going to do ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?

and may i suggest chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
normally i would take you up on that suggestion .
you 're welcome .
that 's fine .
how much do i need ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .

great ! how much is the copy ?

well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work well under pressure . i m patient .
what do you think about your salary ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the <unk> mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
it is a pleasure for me to work with you .
of course . but how can you prove it that way ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's a good idea .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
please let us know when to go to the dinner table . would you mind having dinner with us ?
why are you <unk> ?
well i ca n't believe it .
then what ?
because i am sorry to tell you the truth .
you can count on it .
that 's great !
what were your salary expectations ?
thank you . i will .
yes speaking .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh that 's just what i 'm doing .
i must think this is something that you want to do .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
where is that ?
i 'll be here to pick you up at .
ok . i 'll wait for you .
it 's my pleasure . hope you will recover soon .
goodbye .

yeah that 's really nice . but it 's so nice to see you again .
what happened ?
i know i deserve it . but what can i do ?
no really .
after a week i did n't know how to use it .
so you can have more room for development .
tell me what you want me to do .
good morning mr . li .
it 's already .
is it close now ?
go to sleep then but only five more minutes .
yes i was . i could n't fall asleep .
why are you interested in chinese ?
is that right ?
well todd that 's a great movie .
i 'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
ok . i 'm glad it 's been a pleasure .
to provide you with standby letter of credit should be called by bank of china .
give me a raise .
i would like that .
it 's very quiet and peaceful .
where is that ?
but you must stay calm . do you want me to give you a lift ?
may i have your name please ?
would you like a copy of the manual ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
thank you very much .
retail price is . per unit . we take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price .
that 's not bad . how long have you been in pr ?
how many times shall i stay with you ?
that 's great .
yes . sometimes they do n't have anything to declare .
but we 'd better give them money to pay for it .
that 's right .
oh great . thank you very much .
on the fourth thursday of november .
how much does it cost ?
would you like to attend the meeting ?
i 'll let her know what she 's learning .
anything else ?
yes please . i 'd like a table by the window .
how long have you been there ?
i 'm glad too .
anything you say honey ?
well i have made a specific proposal so i will say it 's no problem .
how much is the programs concerning packing ?
to be frank the most important thing is to be frank .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a commission will not leave us much .
i really appreciate all your help .
good just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . good luck !
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . however as an encouragement for businesses we will allow you a commission .

that 's true . i 'm going to have to join the news .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
yeah !
as a rule we do n't allow any commission . our agents in other areas usually get a pay .
may i have the bill now ?
thank you . by the way when shall we sign the agreement ?
it 's very nice .
thank you . i was really surprised .
thank you . i appreciate it .
it 's so nice !
do n't mention it .
no i have n't . i can speak chinese .
thanks for understanding .
i do wish i could lose weight .
ok .
i see . could you sign the contract please ?
well let me know when i get them back .
that would be fine . i can wait .
the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
i 'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
no problem .
i think the inspection bureau at your end when effecting inspection only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly most probably escaped their attention . as the amount of the whole shipment i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
later we decided to opt for the prior outline version .
when can i find one of those ?
there you are so many baggage . where are you going ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i am .
do you like traveling ?
my colleagues help me with my work .
sure .
it s on the th floor .
may i have a look at it please ?
where should we go eat today ?
sure . you have the wrong number . it 's nice to meet you .
tell me what you 're talking about .
thanks for saying so .
i 'm glad to hear that .
ok . by the way what kind of passport do you want ?
what do you mean by late ?
i 'm sorry . that 's the lowest price i 've ever had .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to rewrite it . it 's so depressing .
and a storm blew our roof away .
i should first pay attention to the second months in the past two months .
how about a training course ?
you are very kind to say so . thank you .
sure we will .
do n't worry about it .
thank you !
a taxi it 's us .
yes you are right .
i 'm fine thanks . just a little tired .
yes . we offer several kinds of tools such as online sales manager .
i 'm not sure what i have to do .
of course it will be ready .
what can i do now ?
that 's fine . thank you .
would you like anything to drink ?
no problem .
yes i do . i have never seen one of them .
what about your garden ?
i was hoping you could bring me the name of the company .
excellent .
blue .
why do you say so ?
yes we will have one .
yes speaking . can i help you ?
i am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow .
what do you think i can do for you ?
it 's on the floor .
yes what can i do for you ?
i am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch .
thank you mr . jackson .
the address is facing the second floor .
i 'm sorry mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
but could you tell me when he will be back ?
i don t know where to call .
this is nathaniel brown .
that 's all right .
do n't mention it .
no problem . what kind of training will it be ?
i hope so .
it 's my pleasure .
how about this afternoon at ?
ok no problem .
em as i have said i 'm diligent and industrious . on the other hand sometimes i 'm too hardworking and i put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
my stomach was bothering me .
you do n't need to worry about it .
certainly .
that 's easy . would you please write a letter of recommendation ?
do you want me to help you ?
what did it say ?
ah i remember i saw that in the tv station .
but thank you very much all the same .
and what 's your salary ?
i see .
what do you like about sports ?
how old is he now ?
i think that 's enough .
then put your name on the top of each page .
yes i know that .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
great i 'll have a try .
yes one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
how are you doing ?
jim . i 'm here to ask her .
yes . what can i do for you ?
this is the room we asked for the room service an hour ago .
all right . thank you very much .
thank you very much . my name is lin .
well as you can . i have a few questions about this next week .
and what is it ?
starting salary is a weekplus commissions of course .
how much is the salary ?
bye !
i 'm amy . what 's up ?
you 're welcome .
yes it 's quite reasonable .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
i get it .
of course . they will take it .
i like playing cards .
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .
sounds reasonable . when can i start working ?
here is the fare and keep the change please .
yes i do .
this can be used for years .
oh dear . it wo n't get there for new year 's day if i send it by surface mail . how much will it cost if i send it by air ?
but thank you very much all the same .
ok .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to work in the banking industry .
why do you want to teach our company ?
i 'll do my utmost if i am hired .
it 'll be ready for a call now .
thank you . i 'm really happy .
i couldn t believe it .
i hope so .
ok . i 'll call you back sometime tonight .
oh i see . so how can i do that ?
you are welcome goodbye .
my name is dunlin and i live in beijing . i was born in . i will graduate from peking university this july . i have majored in accounting .
what courses have you completed ?
i worked as a personnel manager in a stateowned company and then i transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the exile market in china .

mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
nice to meet you mrs . smith .

this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back please ?
ok i 'll tell him .
good morning . i have a reservation for a single room with a bath here .
okay here 's your receipt .

i 'll make sure he gets the message .
i 'd be glad to .
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
but let me see if there 's anything i can do for you ?
of course i can .
what 's the problem ?
yes i do .
tomorrow afternoon .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . .
oh that 's too bad . was it stolen ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
i was robbed this morning .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
may i take a message ?
oh okay . i 'll wait here .
i 'm afraid not . he is away from the office .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i am sorry sir . he has gone out of town on business . may i take a message ?
i have a business appointment with him at ten o 'clock tomorrow morning but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it .
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
what are you assigned to do ?
mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ?
everything is going very well .
finally !
i have no idea . could you give me a pamphlet ?
what are you talking about ?
no problem .
cheer up i 'll tell you what .
thanks for your help . well i believe you are one of the main character . it is not important to me .
i have to write you a letter of credit at the beginning of each month . we are hoping to see what the problem is .
in a case you should prepare your attention to your reply .
you 're welcome .
that would be very helpful .
i can teach you if you like .
what should we do ?
by all means .
i will try my best . that 's what i am going to do .
i 'm not sure . but the reds are a terrible team .
thank you . can you help me with the <unk> ?
i know it is a really good idea to solve the problem .
if so we find it difficult for us to go on with you .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
for what ?
your unit price is dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
well i 'll have to discuss it with our manager . how about yours ?
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok . i 'll take it .
all right . that 's a deal . what 's the price ?
would you like to order a bottle of champagne ?
i want to buy some fruit .
how long will the shipment be ?
what 's this setting made of ?
your price is rather high . can you explain the price ?
that 's very considerate of you mrs . wang .
if that 's the case there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
i know what you mean but if i call me tonight i 'll always have a try .
how much does it cost ?
what 's the price of the sample ?
well they are hard to say . but i 'm not familiar with the heavy industry .
of course . we can have a kinds of samples if you like .
i 'd like to go abroad .
how about some zongzi ?
what 's the special price ?
we provide uptodate training as part of the top equipment .
here 's the latest model .
how many copies do you need ?
here is our price list .
here 's the bath . i do n't care .
that 's fine . thank you very much .
he was in a bit of a hurry .
what about the kitchen ?
what do you do ?
how ay years have you been working with him ?
i m looking forward to it .
but i still do n't think so .
that 's great .
it 's our pleasure . we 'll discuss the matter again with you .
thanks a lot . goodbye .
when can i get a discount ?
have you received any honorable title personally ?
really ? thank you so much .
i 'm glad to hear that . by the way could you tell me something about your responsibilities ?
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
the job is best for everybody .
what kind of people do you enjoy yourself ?
that 's quite a lot . do you have any suggestions ?
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
here is the fare and keep the change please .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
sure . our company is located in beijing .
what is the problem ?
i won t be able to give you back your deposit .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
that 's right . when can i get them ?
well let me check . may i have your name and room number ?
yes .
i see .
i want to work in a restaurant .
can you help me with that ?
can i help you ?
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it .
i am not good at it by any means .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness <unk> . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set <unk> . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more .
well first of all i would like to get a good stereo .
me too .
of course .
where did you learn it ?
it will be hard at first but i think i can do it .
cool ! anything else ?
yes . but you 'll have to believe it .
thank you for your consideration . i am sure you will do well .
this is it ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
i get a bachelor 's degree . i get a bachelor 's degree in english literature .
one thousand units per month .
why is it so expensive ?
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
of course .
i want to know about fees .
sure . what kind of salary do you have in mind ?
thank you .
you can start next week .
when can i get a raise ?
okay mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
it seems that i will do the job well .
sure . what about you ?
are you a problem ?
here is your permit enjoy the next semester .
what did you find ?
how much would you like ?
let 's see it this afternoon .
no .
your flight takes off at
i will send it right now .
i know what you mean .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
would you like to have a look at your room ?
pardon ?
nice to meet you mrs . smith .
that 's great ! i almost forgot !
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
why ? i don t think i m ready for a call now .
you are right .
i see . you ve still got a lot of work in the company . the only thing i would like to do is a good deal with .
i see . is there anything else that can be done ?
my pleasure !
i had no idea .
yes i m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set it up for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i should check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired .
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
can you see the difference ?
that s a great idea . i ll take it .

it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the <unk> centre of the <unk> faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

now that 's not a problem . i do n't know what 's the matter .

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of <unk> and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
how many kids do they need ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they choose a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
anything else ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce <unk> . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
