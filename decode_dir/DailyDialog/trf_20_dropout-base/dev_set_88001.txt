i 'm reading tv .
how about your science ?
i certainly have a swimming pool and a club .
what do you mostly do to any family ?
well i walk to the gym every day .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you should start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
about three times a week .
i would like to cancel a check .
ok but how about coming back ? did you know it ?
no problem .
i mean you 're a student developing all round .

yes . stay in bed for an hour . it 's necessary for you to leave .
ok . i 'll pay for it in cash .
yes i am after some sugar . i ca n't find my sweater .
can you tell me how to buy your own color and internet ?
i think it s of good quality .
sure . cantonese food is rather light beijing food is heavy and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
sure . how about this one ?
oh it 's the one of the famous design . i 'd like to try it on .
ok . give me your address .
thank you .
oh these ? very good .
certainly . here you are .
walk along the road and turn right at the second intersection . it has a look at the head near the station .
how long does the tour take ?
i 'm going to get a little out of shape .
i 'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings .
with this one ?
coffee only black coffee
eating here or to go ?
i see . i will take bags of sugar so that i can get coupons .
no i 'm just browsing today . we have to take an international lunch break .
may i try it on ?
i ca n't decide what to get .
that sounds really good .
yes i 'd like some coffee .
how would you like your coffee ?
yes thank you very much .
ok . i ll bring them one of those .
yes we do .
then how long will it be ?
certainly sir .
ok i 'll put it in the car room .
it 's by my watch .
ok . get your name please .
ok here you are .
i 'd like a beer please . you see we have no idea what you have .
well since you have n't decided on the menu i 'd like to try the local dish .
could i reserve a table for saturday at p . m . ?
may i have the key for room please ?
good evening . can you make it a double will you ?
that sounds like it .
i m looking for a sweater .
do you like olives ? or would you prefer crisps ?
c 'mon ! you ca n't check on your deposit book .
well all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
could you book it for me ?
thank you very much .
well i 'd like to see the sky . but i 'd like to see an idea of making film on the side .
how 'd you know i 've lost it ?
you 'll get it out of the town at the hotel .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
but i told you to blow her out .
please .
great ! i 've got a lot of fun . here 's the form and you are .
hi .
okay . may i ask the name ?
do you recognize the suspect ?
well turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
could i see it over on the th ?
um . . . i think you ve got plenty of time yet .
ok . this is done .
i 'm afraid you ca n't ma 'am . we accept only traveler 's checks and credit cards .
is it a very nice day ?
i 'm sorry . the bathroom is full there .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . can you deliver ?
sure . as you know a secretary i am single girls with that toys after all .
great . here 's my visa credit card .
yuan . you will get it on the price tag .
what do you do ?
well it s cheap and twenty . it s very nice .
but i told you to blow her out .
please .
oh yes and there 's no need to meet the office every day .
is it far ?
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
sure .
can you make my hair short ?
ok . what do you like ?
i think the color is too bright .
i want one that 's good .
sure . i think you should buy a bottle of moisturizer .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
no .
i like one with flowers on its brim .
here it is .
thank you .
sure .
thanks . which kind of medicine do you prefer western medicine or traditional chinese medicine ?
what about the one ?
oh i see . you 'd better wear it .

how would you like your suit ?
can i get a copy of the photos ?
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?
well that 's right . i like it very much .
maybe you 're right but it 's hard to get a bigger one and a little more permanent .
i especially like the style of this one .
i have no idea . i will take this one . it 's a date of fashion designer and i 'll wear whatever they 're doing .
maybe you should give an outlet .
sure . the fitting room is this way please .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?

i think we need to do something else .
the same with me . i heard that our team seems to have a on the internet .
ok . how much is the ticket ?
i understand . but why wo n't you show me the logo ?
i m surprised . you really did a good job .

ok . we will take some later .
sure ! how many copies would you like to have ?
i would like to cancel a check .
yes the shoes are on sale are just as good as you . how about these ?
they 're not really wear the style .
i do n't think i 'll wear a black dress on . do you have any of those skirts in the same style ?
it seems too short .
what do you mean ?
and it also reminds me that people were making their own sale . if they were n't sold two o 'clock they would love to buy the bread .
that 's right . they were required to work today s paper and then tried to give it a secret .
i know a few people who ca n't afford to . he s an excellent idea .

i just want to get something really . um i 'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over here but i 'm also going to get a better seat and buy some of them for this . .
that 's not bad .
can you give me a pc ?
i believe it .
i 'll give it back with her .
i expected it was a good idea to set up the monitor .
ok . i m serious . i won t let it go .
yes .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
i 'm serious have you ?
don t you see many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .

you 're welcome .
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
i do n't like shopping .
i know what you mean . i ca n't wait to do all the things .
i have not had a small gettogether with friends from sichuan cuisine .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .

no nancy the family are living here .
ok go to the supermarket with your friends .

there are a mouse and a camera .
she will be working harder when you 're at home .
i am afraid they 're fully empty .

the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .

only about twenty minutes .
i see . thanks .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .

oh i know . and here 's the money . you need to use my foreign friends free time .
thanks . can i keep a good idea if i 've got a reading ?
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
of course ! everything at helen 's is overpriced and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn t you shop around ?
i do n't know i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too <unk> .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yeah it 's over here .
it 's easy . not every day i get on the bus . so we pay about it .
we ? i thought we 'd go to some more ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
so let 's get registered tomorrow .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .

have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think so . the teacher 's teacher is all right .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
the same here . what did you need to know ?
are you interested in today 's special ?
what kind of reservation do you prefer ?

no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i want to know about it .

yeah . i 'm really hot .
that s a great idea . i 'll bring them back this afternoon .

well it 's a must be very good cook .

i think something must be done .
i m sure we can find a quiet room just by the bed .
how late were you ?
we have a storage place here but you 'd better check out your bedroom and maybe you can find one .

i hope so . there 's no limit on this time .

here 's ten dollars .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
what about a warning ?
can we get there in half an hour ?
oh you certainly didn t come in today mr . brown .
i see . thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
i 'm afraid this one is not in at the moment .
oh i have n't seen you for a long time . do you have anything cheaper ?
yes i 'm thinking about buying a bike .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
thanks . but i 'd like to go there with you .
just a moment please . i 'll see you tomorrow afternoon .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
we have a very wide selection of services that we have just started . the right area of our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments with different rooms are very economical but their layout makes great use of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be ok to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i like him . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello steven !
hi linda . i thought you were supposed to be a dinner party .
oh no it 's easy to get a new job . i 'm sorry about the problem .
i 'm glad to meet you at the moment .
i 've been studying for my exams . i am having some weight .
oh that 's great !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
that 's great . i have no idea if you need anything .
yes i would .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
so what are the new team ?
he 's pretty nice .
what is she ?
actually first of all the employees have been using the same price as a topic as a topic as well .
that 's okay . he probably got a point of giving the ceo in a company that will probably be making the best decision .
ok .
i 'm sorry . there is no need of these drinks .
do you have a seat ?
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
let me help you do . where did you put the bill ?
all right i ll take it you at the gate of your traffic .
whoa ! i m not going to get a boyfriend !
anything of these leads on this city .
ok ! how about scrabble ?
hey i m gonna call them !
i ve never tried one but games is a bit slow for playing .
are you serious ?
i 'm looking for a sweater .
what color would you like to buy ?
i think you re right . i ll just have a look at it . can i see what a laptop likes ?
you need to pay a camera for that camera .
i see . you could also get a digital camera !
sure .
oh i 'm sorry .
so you re pretty interested in applying for a job as an editor ?
yeah but it 's got a bit of a night sweat .
i d suggest that you buy an inexpensive camera .
let me see . . . yes it 's .
really ? i heard about that . it s pretty camera .
what 's it about ?
no . i like the writer 's guarantee . it is much smaller than i imagined .
ok let s do it .
wow ! i thought you had a wrong turn . do you have a card ?
i really ? what 's the matter ?
this is paula blake mr . simmons .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . i want a change .
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
well . how do i get it ?
there s no problem with it !
ok let s see . you can also have a try .
it 's a special gift . it looks like something special . did you give a description of your house ?
what is your method of taking photos ?
i think you 'll find the price tag on this purchase .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are a lot of red color in style . i think they 're expensive . it s there are also the latest fashion that i can get more this one .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
i think it 's enough for our needs . i should know about this one .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
it s a great place .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i like the balcony . let s get a few pointers if you want .
i have n't thought of that .
the apartment is wonderful .
how much do i owe you ?
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do about it ?
we can give you a discount as a deposit .
i will cancel it for you .
how about going to a theatre ?
the price of cpu is dollars into an hour .
i m afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah it 's the same every year . i 'm not sure it will be fun .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly . come back in ten minutes . i can take the fall from the doctor s over here .
i want a one .
what 's the blue one ?
but you could get a little more expensive . this is only expensive .
ok . i m looking forward to it . by the way do you want to go ?
that s great . let s start tomorrow .
sure . i like the design . they re too big . let s see what the pink looks like .
i will take them .
ok here you are .
i need a casual party .
wow you re lucky . i can t find it anywhere .
you re welcome .
this is he . can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i 'm an apartment in seattle and it is quite expensive city .
yes it 's absolutely free of the house . would you like to come with me ?
all right .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i want to visit the great wall wall the ming tombs and the imperial palace .
you do realize that the work is straight ahead down there ?
thank you .
you can bring some whatever you want .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . the price has been reduced by . it 's a real bargain .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's pretty bright .
the house is great ! it s really like a detached or a counteroffer .
i think you re right about the environment .
i think you 're hoping to have something similar to me .
that 's great . i like this one .
oh it s large . and there s a garden in the kitchen .
oh it 's open and crowded .
i will think about that .
oh we get a cat and a cat . we have a dog here .
it is great ! what is it ?
how about a nice massage ?
i think it s a problem with my apartment .
i don t think so . how long do i bake it for ?
it 's my favorite . that 's why it 's so hot .
i love the beautiful lawn . what a great front entryway !
i want it to look at the little later .
well there is a bit major source of room .
it s not very old thing to wear .
hello . what can i do for you ?
hi this is ryan . how can i help you ?
do you know what it 's going to be then ?
i have to think about it .
here you are .
yes i 'm afraid i 'm busy .
i can handle it .
see you then .
what 's your area of the city ?
thanks . i need your help in this afternoon .
no . all i need to do is fill out this form and sign it .
i 'm looking for an mp player . which brand is of the highest quality ?
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
i ca n't find one of those . i 'm a bit worried about that .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that can give writing a better tax and that will help push writing .
what are they doing ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how long would you like your haircut ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for o 'clock .
that 's right . what do you want to do ?
yes please .
would you like a shampoo ?
it 's natural .
do you know the doctor gave me a short hair ?
i 'm sure i will . i just want to attend a meeting tomorrow morning .
i 'm glad to have my assistant card .
yes it is . please calm your nose and nose .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
yes . it 's the most convenient one to get to the sports room .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
ok . also it s will blow out a shirt and a nose drops of chanel .
it 's very good .
oh it 's no problem . it s very kind of you .
do you want to know what kind of things i should do ?
yes i think it will .
yes . here we go .
the best one can be better . the movie is tasty .
oh i see . i like it very much .
is it very cold in that case ?
i thought you 'd be a good place for you .
i know but all you have to do is study .
fine let me check .
we can check out this time for you .
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
that 's too bad .
yes you do . i hope you can understand the contract if you do n't mind .
well how about a family ?
all right . let me check out the flyer . i am sorry .
i think you 'll contact the sellers with it . you can get back to the shop by ourselves .
yes that sounds good . let 's check out what we can check out .
it 's really a good idea . you know that our school is a good idea to get clothes that will have to be used as well .
yes let me check the kitchen .
me too .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
that would be too expensive .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if you can t walk a further room then it will be much better .
sure . i can go to the movies tomorrow .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about some chinese food ?
i prefer sea food .
yeah . i like to know what you mean .
yes .
what were you going to study ?
i like spring .
i think so too . some fried dish are also served with ladies and gentlemen colleagues would like to try some fried rice .
no i 'm sure i do n't . but you know how to try something new .
when you eat your vegetables are very tasty .
thanks .
absolutely . i like it very much .
all right .
you are right . maybe english is the best seller . chinese tea or thai food is hot but i have to taste the most sichuan .
i know . they have all the machines .
well i was busy getting track of the holiday and we 're going to need to put our normally order .
i know . i think that we should try to have them on .
i know . they have exactly the number . which team do they sell ?
i need to .
ok . do they have any other outside calls ?
you 're welcome .
i ca n't agree more .
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
because it 's ok .
we need to know about it .
all right .
they are called all sorts of things . there are several things that are called floating and go to bed .
i actually like your suggestion .
yeah go ahead forks spoons and knives . i roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .
can i find the products that are good ?
yes . what 's the price of your person ?
there 's a great museum of modern art .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know . but i am going to work hard on me and i want to get a little more expensive than i do .
that 's right .
i 'd like to have a better dance hall . do you like it ?
you 'll have to pay every time you overdraft .

i 'm not sure what kind of car i like .
hi peter . how are you ?
i 'm very busy these days .
really ? i hope she will be able to give me a special inclination towards her .
yes 'm going to be okay .
so we can take it out to the window to the <unk> .
i hope so . i won t be able to join those prize in days .
if the food here do they work out well .
i know . but it seems like a lot of people who were taking it .
yes i know that . but i am not sure .
do n't get me a lot of money .
oh it 's a good idea .
i was just hoping to get him to help .
to tell you the truth i 'm just a girl .
maybe i can ask the boss to come home to see me .
that is true .
but you do n't need to have a credit on your back .

thanks . i like it very much .
i heard it 's a chinese girl .
i do n't know what to get .
ok i will bring your name card and i will book you with me one of these books .
i 'm afraid i must write a report on the meter .
and the answer ?
how can i know about that ?
what can i help you with ?
to be honest i just failed my test .
my brother has gone to the states .
i was robbed .
you re in luck !
don t you remember ? today we have been fired for many hours .
anyway do n't worry about him . i think you can forgive him .
i think i want to try a new style .
promise not to do that !
i have been studying english for study and study . i think i 'm making a good decision .
i couldn t agree with you more . you know what i had exactly but we got to get rid of it .
no i never know where to get this job .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
next monday .
i like playing computer games .
what 's your favorite kind of english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
i will . see you then .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
how can you help me to do it ?
i bought it one size up by mistake .
i like cooking . but i do n't like cooking . you know we can get to the menu tonight .
thank you . i am glad to tell you that my parents are getting a more relaxed and teaching .
just soso . you re doing all right ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i m back to taiwan . i know it 's one of the same restaurants .
i like to do it .
how much do you think that will make ?
do n't worry . the traffic is very heavy .
see you .
ok . i 'll do that .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
i was a very good student to both of them . i think i am ready to do a by myself .
yes . they are here for almost three years and today 's classes by the end of each year .
of course i will .
tomorrow is my birthday and i hope i can recover from the pain of flowers .
well i want to tell you that i 've put in my notice .
if you 're lucky you will visit the university of hawaii .

oh that 's no problem . i 'll take care of it .
there 's one on the third floor .
great . i guess i 'll go to that one . thanks for your help .

i think i can be a look at english language too .
i want to go to egypt .

yes i am going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .

he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
my credit card ?
you can check out two books at a time .
my god ! thank you very much .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . could you give me a discount if i keep a long time ?
i need to see that .
how much is it ?
you 're welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
it 's jack white hat .
nice to meet you too .
yeah i like it very much .

oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
that 's a short family .
how many other languages can you speak ?
i know that 's what my favorite is .
you 're just going to have to cut him into the class .
not yet . i did n't get a raise in the long time . i got a scholarship two years ago .
that 's really good .
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
did you guys go on a date already ?
how come ?
i hope you do n't think that excuse lets you off the course .
it 's the tradition .
oh yeah i guess i was stunned for a pizza for friday .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
did you also go on a honeymoon ?
it was n't as good as i had one day of the rides .
what 's the matter ?
because it s often nothing .
that 's really tough . i 'm sure you will like it .
i think i caught a cold .
what 's the matter ?
i 'll do my best .
hi .

i went to the travel agent .
i decided to return some books as well .
that 's a good idea .
no i 'm afraid i 'm going to take it .

it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .

so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .

she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .

i want to be a professor a lawyer in the future . i will like to help people move from university and make money .
i think you re right with what you re going to do .
do you have any questions ?
maybe we should work on different projects .
i hate to but what ?
i think you re right . we ll need to face the amount of money in the office to improve your intellectual property .
what ? what if we can t ?
that s good news . what shall we do ?
i think i should have been keen on this job and it seems that there are always a lot of people who are trying to learn .
it sounds like you 're right it 's just a dream .
great . thank you .
no problem .
i need to get a passport .
i need to make a transfer .
i need to know if there 's a possibility of making a big mistake .
did you check the periodicals ?
no i haven t .
i ll just have to write you a ticket .
do you have a seat in the back ?
i guess so .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
there are cords that you can see the stars . com decides to describe the price of millions .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is it says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
what about the olympics ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel a check .

you need to attend the wedding and do n't forget your sister to put them under their tree .
do you want to be a trend ?
i 'll be happy to know about the position of sales .

to be honest i 'm not too sure . but i feel terrible too .
are you trying to help me ?
very useful . i think i 'll do better later .
do you think you can study hard ?

yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
it was n't too bad .
i think it is the film film film developed . so it was said that the movie was prepared to have more beauty .

what s the time ?
well . you ve got a lot of papers on the delay . we re very busy on this week .
yeah . i m going to look at the train station when i put the money in it s trying to get this .
how about the glad that you 're here to get started ?
that 's a good idea . his father is a baby .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
how about a boy ?
can you give me the pepper and fat ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ?
what are you talking about ?
thanks . but this doesn t look too good .
the test is for cholesterol and has both sides .

i 'm glad to hear that .
why ? what 's wrong ?
but i like them .
it definitely is . and see you tomorrow .
i love the paint colors too . do you like the design ?
what does a mango taste like ?
i ca n't say that again .
can you introduce him to me ?
by the way do you know that she is also a dog ?
you mean like my husband .
i do n't like to say i 'm pretty excited about this . i like to thank you very much .
all right . over here sir . how are you today ?
i 've been having a lot of money .
oh come on . give me a break !

i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
oh i do n't think i will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
um . . . let me see now is it or i can never remember . . . . . . . next birthday . tthat 's it .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
ok .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
that 's how it works . i 'm going to have to let you go .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
how much does it cost ?
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's infuriating ! i have to be in rome by five .
what happened ?
i just stayed in bed and watched the piano .
what 's the matter with her ?
sure . what 's the problem ?
i am looking for an article in a newspaper .
when's the last time you took it ?
a pipe broke in my wall and water is leaking .
that 's too bad .
could you tell me how to use the machines ?
ok . i 'll take this steak and potatoes .
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .
trust me it . i think we 're ready to order something .
well i think i 'll try the one .
do n't mention it .
ok . thank you .
will you be interested in applying for this sweater ?
sure . what kind of dessert do you have ?
do n't mention it .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
have you bought it ?
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
that 's great .
sure . there is no charge at the moment .
oh it 's too large . but i ca n't afford that one .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you are kidding !
oh yeah .
thanks .
oh i know you 're going to be there .
you could get a boarding pass at that time .
yes i am happy with the service . it 's a good thing .
i am thinking of taking a walk .
thanks for the warning !
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
i had a bad day yesterday and i had to have my own game .
i m very sorry . i must have been delayed .
great . it ll be time to take a job out here .
thanks . i 'd like to learn some chinese cooking .
i want to try some chinese food .
does n't touch the sky ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s not a bit bad idea .
ok . i m looking for a ticket for this wedding .
excuse me but are we going to have a walk ?
i know . how to drive on the way can we ?
ok here 's the list .
how do you feel about the cable ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
ok . go ahead !
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let s call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm getting dressed what does it look like ?
fine ! i am going to buy one and put my coat in it .
well you are pretending !
well i think the older generation tend to like that .
dad it s too bad . i don t think he is food too much stress .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
come on . i know what you mean . i am too busy !
talk to me about my roommate . i am sorry to share the service .
really ? i should have a good eye to eye with my eyes .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
there is a charge on here that i never made .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know that . thank you very much .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yeah you need to apply for a job that is not what you have to do .
thanks .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no i did n't . i 'm planning on writing a prize .
it 's true . i hope you will recover soon .
the boss lost my job .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
thanks for coming .
when do you leave ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
why are you leaving so early ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?

they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am just getting dressed up . how do you keep my clothes ?
it 's on the nose . they re both eyes and you know what as on your face .
you bet it 's about my little brother .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he did n't have a girlfriend last week .
i think you are absolutely right .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
yeah those classics from the great writers .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
i 'm ok . is there anything else ?
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes i 'm not too excited about it .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
so now we can watch the program .
that 's fine . let 's go shopping .
oh i really hope that it does n't rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
i m happy to know that she is going to be with me .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem . i 've got some beautiful outlook in the olympic games .
i 'm sorry but my boss is seriously injured .
i 've asked santa to bring me a bottle of wine .
that 's great . would you like to join us again sometime ?
fair . i 'm really looking forward to your visit .
what about your parents ?
thanks .
i 'm sorry dad . i can t get any of them .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
what 's wrong with his girlfriend ?
i know . well they know that the original price of the policy is becoming more expensive and the more expensive .
congratulations . i can just hope everything will be back as soon as possible .
how about a dessert ?
what do you mean janice ?
i have a sore throat and headache .
take it easy . try it and see if you can help .
you mean i have to pay for it ?
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
my mum wants to take a test to pass for my mother .
what would you like to go with me ?
good thanks .
sure .
do you recognize the suspect ?
thanks . which gate should i go to for ?
you 're welcome .
good idea .
yes .
should we walk ?
maybe you 're right .
because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousandyearold tree .
you used to have a dog or a cat .
i 'll take one .
yes i did .
but i am not sure .
um i 'm very sorry .
who 's she ?
excited excited to meet you . ms . stevens is also a student who can help you with her .
he 's got a promotion .
where are you going ?
no joke !
i 'm not good at them .
what kind of sport do you like ?
the ones that you see are the red ones are the cheapest and those are the ones that are ordinary things .
i guess not really . sometimes they get together with beautiful attitude .
i m afraid that they hold on fashion for more .
it s a piece of cake to me .
of course not . i know it 's just the sort of guy who keeps me fit .
not yet . i am still hungry now .
i ve already voted .
forsythia . it 's also a favorite kind of dry red wine .
that s too bad . it might help you if you were too lenient .
yeah .
is it the same in fact that it 's always a bit too late for your thanksgiving ?
let 's just say that by the end of the week . my family is coming home too .
what kind of winter is it ?
how long have you been here ?
well there 's nothing i 've heard .
i will .
actually i had a fantastic time . i learned quite well .
well don t forget it .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
well we could go to the newsagent s waiting for their safety deposit .
yes .
that s pretty good . how much are they ?
i m serious .
today is playing the game .
i often like that idea .
thank you ! i have a look at these table .
it 's like him .
he has an nervous guy .
we 're welcome to our president .
ok . i love the dance . but it 's terrific . let 's dance and dance .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
no i 'm a little english .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh no ! i 'm sure he will ! he 's a cheater . i do n't know what he 's doing !
how many times did you like the book ?
what did you do there ?
it 's much different from the information . and the author 's name is . .
you can see it next friday .
how much does the tape cost ?
the internet is a story . you 've been learning so much from your academic year .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are trying to get along with the staff . he 's not easy to get along with .
what about the kitchen ?
that sure is . he has the best friend who could be his best friend .
how ay people are working with him ?
well i guess i 'll ask my manager to see if he 's going to his office .
merry christmas jina .
the same to you !
we can also make a special christmas tree in advance . do n't you care for it ?
i do n't know . but if you want to buy a bottle of wine i 'll take care of it .
it sounds good . but i 'm afraid i 'll be busy tomorrow .
it 's all right . but let 's go .
yes she is . but i can t imagine her .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
he 's the producer and the director the stars heroine and the hero .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
well i 'm sure she can do that .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i can tell you what kind i like .
second . but how can it be ?
i know . they do n't really know anyone .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
it 's hard to say ! the music is so delicate and boring . i like the novels .
i like the read stories . it 's a little romantic but there are several detective stories .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
i like variety shows .
that 's a good idea . which class do you like to read ?
the shipping documents must be kept in the contract area and the other day after tomorrow .
i think it 's a good idea .
it 's for around two weeks . but i 'll need to change it .
oh i see .
i do n't understand . it means that every drive has been delayed .
i do n't think that there is any major problems .
really ? i want to go too .
oh there are two very big suitcases .
the seats ? how does it know ?
no man won t .
how about some coffee ?
i agree with that .
yes it 's the one that stole my uncle 's day .
i see . how do it 's not like it ?
yes they are .
i saw him with a boyfriend from the doctor 's doctor . she seemed to be quite upset about something like that .
ok thank you .
that 's true .
yeah . he is a hard worker . he can never tell anyone to find out what his own heart to do .
yeah it seems that i can only get a couple of days ago .
yes . i prefer to talk to my friends and i .
you are such modern girl . anyway people must have been realized to network .
i 've never heard of that .
i guess i might change the subject .
let me see . what 's the problem ?
you know she 's the only one who has been in love with her .
there is no doubt that he ca n't find it .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yes i 'm going to the states but i 'm here to visit the states .
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
what 's your name ?
ping .
what do you think about it ?
i 'm from the post office . my name is wang hua .
the score was .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has .
i knew it was a good game .
that 's a shame .
our team lost by three times .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
oh hi jack ! i was just watching tv .
oh i 'm going to the hospital . how about coming ?
he is ok but i 'm sure he will hear it .
oh that 's too bad .
i think that too . he 's an allright guy .
let 's hear it . we will follow the kitchen .
are you sure ? i ca n't believe it .
you 're right but i will try it later on !
see you later goodbye .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what 's your date of birth ?
china beat brazil to .
let me think everyone will .
you do n't think you 'll be the best .
you 're right . how about the minutes ?
yes he gave me the wrong number but he had to be able to move up .
yeah .
he is . he 's very generous and he 's got never here a lot .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at weddings .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yes they are .
have you been asked to carry anything for a stranger ?
in fact we are beginning to make preparations .
for the wedding ?
no no for the engagement .
try to catch this bouquet then .
good morning ! i 'd like to buy a ticket to singapore please .
i 'm planning to spend some time with my family but i think it 's about time to get rid of my time .
well i 'd suggest you try some more authentic chinese food .
i 'm interested in the restaurant . i 'm interested in the chinese arts .
well it 's not far away from here .
how 's your family ?
here 's a twenty .
thank you .
i would like to go back to school tomorrow .
how about having dinner with me ?
yes let 's go ahead .
yes i did . it was awful .
are you serious ?
i do n't think the character was suit and the scene of the audience .
actually they are of terrible things .
hello steven !
hi linda . i thought you were supposed to be a dinner party .
oh no it 's easy to get a new job . i 'm sorry about the problem .
i 'm glad to meet you at the moment .
i 've been studying for my exams . i am having some weight .
oh that 's great !
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
that 's great . i have no idea if you need anything .
yes i would .
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went there last month .
so what are the new team ?
he 's pretty nice .
what is she ?
actually first of all the employees have been using the same price as a topic as a topic as well .
that 's okay . he probably got a point of giving the ceo in a company that will probably be making the best decision .
ok .
i 'm sorry . there is no need of these drinks .
do you have a seat ?
actually i do n't know but i like to play .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
the shows are very fashionable and the roses .
yes . i m trying to find my hobby . i m good at making my own decisions now .
that might be something better to me .
i used to be a musical . but i do n't really know how to play well .
by the way can you tell me what the radio is today and what 's favorite sport of it ?
sure . good for you .
we broke up . it was raining cats and dogs .
i think you 'll have a better idea .
she was in my life and it 's fun . he did n't know how to do anything by myself .
yes i remember him .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
did they drive ?
this is just between the park .
it is really worth trying for you to work in america .
what do you think is wrong with it ?
no . i ca n't tell them . where did they put those ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
criminals are above all !
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
what time is it ?
well he never came .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he say ?
do you have a foreign country ?
let me see . well i have more than before ! you 're so excited that you could get something to eat !
great ! i 'll listen to your dance and watch it with my friends .
what 's your favorite color ?
absolutely . but it 's very convenient and fast .
it 's so convenient . if you use the card which i 'll use it in the branch to pay some money ?
give me a minute . i 'll start a little later .
i was able to attend the olympic games after graduation . it was so beautiful .
can we just go to the park and could we have a seat at the lounge area ?
no . i did n't even talk to her at her and that she 's still sad .
i had a few coffees while i was in the united states .
are you sure you were n't speeding ?
yeah i remember that she 's been with her boyfriend for years .
he simply wanted to have a grade .
is the suspect that he gave a good deal to him ?
she was a very nice person .
it 's our pleasure . so what makes you more interested in ?
remember my pleasure .
i 'll go .
i 'll see you later then .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . let s get together and ask for a dance party this evening .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . you must have also added copies of your online performance .
wow that 's interesting .
the national anthem of the festival is just about the moon cake . why do n't you come with us so often ?
oh i see .
no it 's not very expensive . it 's more complicated than the old one with a simple policy .
it 's a good idea to know a little about your hands . i 'm sure you 're a little tired .
i think you should do well . look at the five routes for the replace .
no way . i can watch shakespeare is surely said an amazing ability to judge people by using their own game .
because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before it will do you harm .
what 's the weather there ?
nothing really .
yes i see . thanks for reminding me .
it is just the one that 's better . i want to have a look at the neighbors .
do you have a lot of room ?
the party starts at .
wonderful ! is this your first break here ?
i 'm gonna go ask someone else 's plan to get a snack .
by the way what 's the rate in the morning ?
i think a lot of people are taking part in the class .
how about the olympic games ?
thanks .
thank you mr . li . you 're so welcome to come in tomorrow . i 'd like to invite you to the dinner .
thanks i like it . i was born here last year .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
but i have a question of that .
the ancient olympics is basically two festival one from the five major cities which is a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the world .
why ? have you visited our wedding ceremony ?
just think it will get your promotion right ?
do you have any special ideas about it ?
they are doing well .
sounds like a good question .
really ?
it 's kind of tradition to say so . we 're worried about losing money .
well the money for the money we do n't have to pay for it .
oh that 's a good idea . i love to go fishing the river . it 's fun .
what 's your favorite color ?
you 're right .
what about the signs ?
star war .
it 's not a problem but it also does n't have a lot of money .
to where we can pay by car .
what else does it work ?
yes it 's a great job . and it also has become a professional boy so she needs to have a guest own met my parents .
cool . anything else ?
oh we 'll change the machines for a page from the computer lab .
it will be open on sunday morning .
i know there is a place of interest such as people there . but it wo n't work .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
we 've invited all our wedding for our wedding .
until your brother comes back .
the pleasure is mine .
well the state will benefit a lot i suppose .
it 's per month .
can you tell me about your square room ?
i am sure you can .
that 's a very expensive idea . but to be honest you need to do some local currency .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
so what 's the problem ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
we also want to be a little more in the mountains here .
i am really excited to know that you are .
thanks a lot .
what was the score at the end of the game ?
how did you go ?
that 's a long way to go .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
yes . i m very tired after working .
i usually only use it a couple of weeks i m a member of the family .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
let me help you out . i will see if you have a good time .
no i 'm full .
yeah maybe . i will try some wine .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks .
oh . i 'm afraid the time is bad .
look at him he is really a big fan of things .
i don t think there is enough money for them to send people to where they are .
no i do n't think so . i 'm sorry .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
oh did you do anything ?
yeah i was taking a walk to the station .
really ? do you know what his name ?
yeah .
oh . i 'm glad to hear that .
i hope there was no rush .
now let me know if you have any questions .
there 's no extra charge on this card .
excellent . i think i 'll come here for a while .
no . please feel free .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean . . . are they much lower than the corporate world ?
well i went to the blue mountain last year .
i 'm from your office i think you 're in luck !
waltz is my favorite .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i like the kind of style that has been popular with me because i like the old style .
whatever . i m not only modern but i think we re boring .
yeah the certainly is . listen music is a good game .
what 's the matter with her ?
haha . . .
no it is . the chinese usually have been sung in china for a while . the chinese folk performances are supposed to be performance in china .
i ca n't believe it .
they usually do . in the west the purpose of the national think is generally quite simpleto savor the wine .
in that case i think maybe five years and i can be sure about that .
we are in the center of the table . let 's find our seats .
haha they 're got mostly interested in driving play to the state 's fondness for the sport
of course .
absolutely . i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot of responsibilities .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok let 's go see the movie .
ok . let 's go .
thank you for your invitation . i will introduce you to your music .
do n't you like it ?
yes it 's my favorite .
i hate to play football with a bunch of friends .
to a disco ?
what 's your favorite dance ?
ok . i like it very much .
ok . let 's dance it .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
certainly . i like the old style but i do n't dance very much .
the forbidden city is basically two or three hundred people 's head but the sugar is very good .
oh well the music has stopped .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
i know but i 'm afraid it 's too bright .
yes it 's the one who has to stay in bed after work .
oh yes he 's getting a little exercise .
to tell you the truth i do n't like it .
that sounds like a good idea to bring a <unk> to my favorite dish .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the tango wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor breakdancing .
oh yeah you can play the piano . while a cup of coffee is dance i ca n't dance it .
my pleasure .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
do you like swimming ?
no . the rent is rather low .
hmm . . . i 'll do it .
absolutely .
how long do you think you 'll enjoy this ?
yes . but i 'm not sure .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which seasons do you like best ?
spring .
well it 's three weeks away .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado .
i like it but i 'm not so sure about the weather .
yes it is . but it 's really cold .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like hot weather but sometimes it gets too cold .
well i have got finished . it 's really warm and warm in the sun .
oh yes . i like the color of the grass .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love the snow ! it 's so warm here !
that 's the reason why i 'm always short of cold in winter .
i 'll wash the dishes .
i see . not everyone 's eyes .
that 's right . how about this one ?
i 'm from america . are you a foreign languages ?
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
oh thank you . that s very kind of you .
it was a pleasure .
how much do you charge ?
what is the difference ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
can i start next week ?
thank you .
i 'll see you then .
no i 'm afraid i ca n't .
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with it .
i 'd love to .
do you have a car or motorbike ?
do you have a club card for children ?
june rd .
alright i 'll bring it in this afternoon .
you 're welcome . bye .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
it 's my pleasure .
you 'll find that our prices are as good as you say . you know we are a low employee .
sure i will . thanks !
i want to buy a new car .
did you just ask him to teach him ?
yes he 's very intelligent .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i am very fond of chinese arts and crafts .
well it was just a little of my wife . i am really sick of those things .
then what 's wrong with it ?
that sounds great . i 'm going to a disco with my friends .
we 'll try to do that but only if you ca n't reduce it to .
well tomorrow evening .
thanks for the invitation .
oh i am sorry . i have no idea .
they are the financial <unk> . they re not very powerful .
i 'll bet you had a dog then .
yes there are . i also grew up in a big family who lives in london .
yes i 'm going to take a trip to see my aunt .
do n't mention it .
you 're welcome .
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome .
me neither . i really think it 's enough for you to do that .
i will .
yeah . but she definitely gives me a lot of money .
do you think most women like girls who are confident ?
you can always be able to do things on your computer and you need to keep it as mementoes .
i 'd love to see it .
oh come on . it 's a pity that i can keep the apartment so you ca n't have enough time to relax .
well you 're right .
that 's good . you should do your homework and have them every day .
i am very sorry for that .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i agree . we need to grow more air pollution before .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
and you 'd better hurry up if you buy up for awhile .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i watched it last week . it was the best party of the world s birthday .
how did you do that ?
it is n't too far from here .
ok it is . all they have to be honest about getting track of the latest fashion .
me too . i ca n't possibly find my way to protect an eye on its own .
absolutely .
i did n't know you liked the fashion . i think it was too interesting .
it 's making its products like yours .
very interesting . so it seems they had quite interesting history .
yes that 's right .
i 'll take those .
i 've got it .
bring me a chance to study after school .
i see . how is it easy ?
that sounds like a good idea .
let 's find the way .
oh thanks a lot .
of course i know it .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
stop beating around the bush .
no i have n't .
sure ! i 'll take them all .
i suppose he 's like us .
i know !
the woman was show the race by the film . he was very young and the film made a change of the film .
oh ! i love them ! hey look ! they were scary !
basically they were just killed .
oh i see . so many people were destroyed in a chat .
i do n't know why you say it does n't work as much as the sign .
yeah but i need to cash my travelers card . then i need to withdraw some money .
thanks .
it leaves at
c 'mon do n't you know me about it ? i 'm always excited about cars .
then my son drove into a tree .
maybe i 'm going to buy a ticket to chicago on the plane .
do you think i could borrow some from a couple of beers ?
ok let 's go .
she live at the supermarket in her house .
oh it 's lovely .
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she lives in washington dc .
no i was still a little sick . i really couldn t sleep well .
what did you do to help ?
yes i do .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i have two children and a girl .
who 's the bridegroom ?
they are completely different things .
what 's your job ?
they are .
who are they ?
yes they are .
what are her brother ?
i know english is a middle school .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
she 's really nice .
it 's really pretty .
ok . well after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
it s really very good .
i 'm your member card .
thank you .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the smartest young man .
what 's the matter ?
and how about night ?
but i 'll take the book .
i will be there at pm .
well you 'll be home so you can stay out and get back home .
it 's interesting .
what do you think of your mother ?
don t worry . it s just that she is going to have a family with us .
yeah .
no i don t think so .
yes .
oh that 's a good idea . why did you get a new one ?
well i know my bottom dollar that i m ready to go .
i feel he is going to be the same thing as he was in trouble .
have you ever been there before ?
why not ? i like going by myself .
why do you say that ?
ok . i ll try .
why ?
what 's the problem ?
it 's total late .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
maybe mary 's father is a rich man .
the movie theater is just too good to get her with our employment contract .
did you think she is going to have a chance ?
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . you can study later on . it s not very convenient .
what ?
the hardcover is more expensive .
i know . today is playing it 's interesting to listen to the radio .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
no . ok i 'll pay for it .
you are full of job . i am wondering if you would like to go out with me tomorrow .
did you like nba ?
em it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
i am going to put on a card .
it is ok . but to tell you the truth you have to reduce your bag .
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .
i would love to .
when is the next plane in ?
i couldn t believe it .
i 'm sure you 're on the tv .
we certainly need to talk about your schedule .
yes i did . and i think you still have a good time !
well to be honest i 'm really going to love the start of the art gallery . it 's great up these days .
i can understand that .
yes it is .
at least you need to go to the bar first . the chinese restaurant is right there .
i promise . so you should n't go to bed until you get ready ?
what 's the occasion ?
yes . everything is perfect .
so you can work here .
i am great ! how about you mary ? how are you ?
well i 'd love to . but i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've heard of it all friday .
i 'll be there .
yes i am .
sure . it 's upstairs in my room .
sure . i 'd like to come .
i 'm sorry . when did you come back ?
i 'm sorry . my name 's try .
i think i might n't have enough food .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
what 's the matter ?
i really enjoy the food .
i have lived here for twenty years .
well . you 're a big drinker .
you think it is the most important thing to me .
how many diners will have ?
i know there 's a coffee shop nearby . can you come here to taste ?
all right . here 's your sugar .
yeah i 'm very busy right now .
yes mary and i went to bed .
ten days .
i see . but there is still one thing .
i 've been studying hard for my exams . now i am studying a little longer than five years .
what are you going to major in ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but that will probably take long every year .
yeah . i find it is said that i can work with my writing and in my writing .
yeah i want to see you so here .
you 're welcome .
let 's go to watch an nba game tonight shall we ?
no . i am interested in graduate school .
and what do you do ted ?
fine . thanks .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
i 'm looking for a warning .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
it 's fantastic .
are you sure ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's out of the blue nissan that keeps me under the tree .
she said she would be surprised .
tom that lucky guy .
he s been out of the last few months . he had no idea and did a lot of homework .
oh i hear that . he simply feels hard .
she is tired .
she s quite with me .
i want to buy a different color carpet .
oh that 's a girl .
well control is really using common sense .
i 'm not sure . he 's very good of his office .
how old is he now ?
do you know the officer ?
well we have more or less but you will watch more tv .
yeah . she is still a teacher .
yeah she is .
you do n't have to say that she 's really healthy than her !
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i m afraid i should have told you about that .
my daughter is making her own decision .
thank you for your help .
i don t think this place is right as well .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i told him that i 'm terribly sorry .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
they say the main thing is poverty . he 's a very good teacher and he or her employees .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . it 's getting dark .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right .
no wonder your boss .
how much was it ?
thank you .
i want a nonsmoking room please .
he said he had a fight with his girlfriend .
you can put it in the box mark for your father 's fault .
sure . who will be the best man ?
can i see that xray to get worse ?
did you sign the register here ?
i found it a garage sale once .
oh that sounds like a lot of pressure .
i did n't know it was a time ago but i got a little sad .
i think so . but it seems we should learn from each other and learn .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's a great tradition .
yeah it s definitely a piece of women . they are blind people not only .
maybe you should communicate with him . i do n't think he needs common sense .
do you have a good wedding ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
how long have you been married ?
well it 's better than the bus .
it seems that we can break down to the internet .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then what did you do ?
i have a boyfriend . but i m not in love with him .
what about cats ?
sure . we like our special brand .
oh i think most of the girl like you . it s good for them to do some things like a family .
if i give you one i like .
i 'm a good dancer . i like to invite you to dinner .
that s right .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
pretty good .
you should have a small family .
there are people in my family .
how do your family live there ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
that 's right . but some people must have the same interest to do that to pay their own bills soon .
that 's true . there are only one thing your parents do n't understand . in fact your junior year will never happen again .
i do n't think everyone will understand having a big heart attack !
i wish your parents took you out well when they re older .
sure . i used to work with someone who get along with each other .
i see . what 's he like then ?
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum i was hoping you d like to come with me .
i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day .
what about sunday ?
i wish i could but it 's my <unk> birthday .
maybe next week .
much as i d like to i am afraid i wont be free next week i have a lot of work .
sorry to hear that i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you i really enjoyed our last chat .
i am really sorry too maybe i can give you a call sometime .
nothing really why what s up ?
if you are free maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun you will get to know lots of people .
that sounds great . i 'll think about it .
anytime . how about friday ?
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it but thanks for the offer .
ok i will see you then .
bye .
how moving is .
can you describe the problem at that time ?
my boss was talking about me .
what do you think about it ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
she is expecting some kind of her father .
that 's the beauty of my husband .
you ve got a lot of money . those are very expensive .
turn the lights off .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .
ok great should i bring anything ?
no but thanks for offering actually could you bring some foldup chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone 's going to have a seat do you have any ?
sure i will be happy to bring a few what is the address ?
do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about thirty .
got it .
how did he say ?
what s her personality like ?
what symptoms does she have ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
take it easy . they will get caught .
then what 's the problem ?
i think most of the buildings is that we have no idea about the historical record in the past .
so what 's the favorite ?
he is a lawyer .
mine are n't you sure about that .
sure . but he s too hardworking .
sure . they re ok .
well we re planning to talk about them later . but we re going to be busy tomorrow .
ok .
he said he would be able to make it .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
then tell me about it .
yep . your eyes are mostly fat and you should keep your knees .
well . i think we can come to the restaurant .
i was fired last week .
i m getting enough sleep . let s see .
i hope you 're right .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
in the spring .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we 're not sure yet . we 're going to take a sauna for an interview .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes . did you bring any meat ?
it 's a pity that the goods must be on sale .
it is .
well we can buy a souvenir ! another glass of coffee here i just made a lunch !
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better !
good thing .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
do you have anything to declare ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
i work in the morning .
that 's good . i do n't like movies . can i bring a good trip there ?
it was n't all that great .
he was really scared .
speaking . may i ask who 's calling ?
excuse my troubling you . you purchased our products last year and now i am following up to find out about their workings . are they still in good condition now ?
hi jack . nice to meet you .
just fine . thanks .
sure i m free . sorry i m just taking a lunch break .
how about at ?
good evening david .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
i have n't .
then shall we go to the party ?
nice to meet you .
oh thank you .
how do you do ?
hi steven . this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
sure . maybe next time .
you are so welcome .
yes i do n't know what to do .
i have no idea . let me look at the pamphlet . it was ok .
i think i have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i m looking forward to that you .
i am sure i will . i 'm sure i 'll have a loan from our company .
i 'm going to buy some cleansing milk .
i 'm sorry sir . the computer has gone down to the next month .
yeah . why not ?
yes .
do n't forget about it . in this job we get along with each other .
to tell you the truth there is no limit to how you can feel at which you 've already got to wait for your call .
i understand . so what does it include for my health ?
i 'm sure you can . you also need to pay in cash or credit card .
but i want a change of money .
your company has a strict working experience as a secretary .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool .
i went on my own it in a few months ago but it 's still a bit expensive . can i afford an apartment ?
oh i 'd love to come and watch the news .
you mean look in the library ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
well my parents and i want me to be more independent . they said that they want me to teach at some school .
well i know how you 're going to find out what the problem is today .
my uncle 's parents . she lives in new york .
and how much for your stay ?
they did n't have me . my family lives in the park was incredible but they still have a lot of fun .
what did your parents do ?
cindy your daughter 's mother is a housewife . my grandma does n't think he will help .
sounds like a long trip .
you are under arrest sir .
could you tell me why i am interested in taking photos of the property ?
yeah . you get the tv system while i was playing .
how do you like him to get together ?
what are i going to do ?
what does that mean ?
he is just as handsome as well .
what will the party be the first child ?
that is a common practice .
oh i think the family will like that . by the way do you think the kids have big fight at the same time ?
they know what happened .
it s quite reasonable .
no i 'm afraid they 're really busy .
it 's really fantastic . they are really looking for those goods now .
tell me how long have you been learning to enjoy the united states ?
what about your family ?
she started a teenager in my mother .
i hope you know .
how sweet . . . well if i were you i would not have to attend an interview if i remember what you mean . after all you do i need to do something different .
but if there is anything else i should do for you to get to the job done and then make it rich you know so at the right time .
i do n't think you are right .
i ve been out of town . i just been out of town .
really ? are you getting a little or this vacation ?
yes . i ve been in paris for two weeks . and i haven t even had a few luck yet .
when did the next time ?
yes beautiful . i can see the scenery there .
no but i do n't think it 's a beautiful time .
oh yes i guess you can stay in love with us .
i m fine . and you ?
oh yeah just for a few days ago . i should go and play games together .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you like to play ?
well i used to use some exercise to use decent times but i wo n't do it . i just need to build up a couple of days .
you 're getting a good exercise and it 's easy for you to exercise .
i think it s time !
but i can t afford that . in fact i ll be able to exercise every day but you ve got to keep a secret .
well . would you like to go to the airport ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
if you want to climb a cliff on the yangtze river .
do n't worry . i can help you learn a lot from the <unk> .
i have been working on the internet .
why do you say that ?
no i did n't .
nothing .

double one zero two ? i m crazy !
you really should have an football match with another player .
what do you think will be the most interesting one ?
which is better ?
well let 's just say how the ancient olympics is coming to the next board .
they are both doing well .
maybe . i was played too fast and sometimes played cards with my schoolmates .
do you think that 's a good idea to a lose ?
well there are not some kind of job i guess . you know i m a member of this company .
i think that s my opinion . i m actually in top of my life . the boss was always trying to find me cheap .
i 'm glad we meet each other .
i know teachers are a very different person .
oh yeah . i never exercise ! how often do you exercise ?
great ! i have a few idea how to run a campus here .
that s a good idea . some chinese tea would be great . i hate it .
so why do we start a lot of practice ?
absolutely . but we should learn a lot from our customers .
i don t have any idea . i need to run out of the exercise to keep fit .
ok . i can ask about one of the exotic tour of my mom .
good idea .
how old is he ?
are you really a teacher ?
elvin is n't serious . he said she wants to have to learn how to control his selfesteem .
i want to do something different . you know i 'd like to take a look at this report first .
yeah i think they 're the most coffee .
you 're right . it 's always hard to save money .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
all right . i will explain it to you later .
i am going to get an early start . i can understand .
a question ? you said you were only one of our favorites !
it is a <unk> sum . hey it 's not the end of my life .
elvin please . i ca n't really tell you a little about him .
i 'm all right thanks . and you ?
yep . and americans were asking for their new mobile phone system .

it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
maybe you 're right but keep in touch .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you bet . i work in the finance department . i 've been living here for two years .
he had better make a change of time .
how could you do that ?
yes you know what i am worried about him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an encyclopedia .
oh i see . but it will make it . bet it will make you a lot to do .
ok . thank you for shopping here .
ok . do you want to pay extra money ?
that 's because we do n't have much done .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song in the window is sing the song of the song .
he is a hero in the super girl .
of course ! i 'll sing them and get used to my favorite ones .
i do n't have one single favorite but she says she is a <unk> man !
she is also a team player but that s what she is going to do .
no i don t know . she s a girl who often on the job .
are you on the movie ?
yeah you are right .
yes .
i 'm not sure but i can find her something that i have a good idea .
what s this ?
i 'm watching a football game .
fantastic !
they are different . we had a tradition .
but he is n't messing up son . he 's going to start talking about his business card .
yes . he was very tall and slim .
it 's all sounds so interesting .
he said not to study in the united states .
oh yeah .
yes the computer is broken by virus that computer system over there . but i can see that through chinese writing it .
why not ?
that 's true . but still it has a history .
i will !
don t be sure . we ll have time these drinks and we need some coffee too .
yes . he 's half a break into practice .
it does n't matter .
do you know the code ?
do you know how to do the pills ?
i know what you mean is that my boss should do now .
do you know the name of the street ?
i guess in a hurry would you join me ?
sure . so do they come back to school with me ?
no sir . i 'll have a room in the back of the city .
good . i 'll take it . . . we can also look at that .
no you will change your mind .
i see . how beautiful is it ?
i can dad and ask my parents to come here to visit me tomorrow .
that 's right .
that 's interesting .
you like doing the special ?
i 've always given one more credit to give it a try .
he 's the one of the most famous guy at the moment .
can you hold the line please ?
yes .
it 's not just a problem .
i 'll introduce him to the television as soon as he comes back .
thank you doctor . he is really a nice guy .
yes .
all right . thank you .
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning mrs smith .
sure you can . i 'm going to get together with all the family .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
ok i will .
take the subway . it has lots of clients and stores there .
these are the growth of these <unk> sites . have you ever been on the net ?
yes there 's one on the street . if you want one there you can use them .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . can you tell me how to get to the bus ?
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let 's see . good luck !
well i think they 're a tough waste . ok i 'll change the image of the vegetarian dishes .
yeah you know the tv system is hard to find people from their physical exercise .
oh these pajamas ? how do you think i 've got that too ?
i 'd like to see it .
i 'd love to see it !
what about other types of chinese arts ?
i know you 're such a good learner .
i 'm sorry mom .
honey i can hardly tell your mother about that .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
but i also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
who knows it !
oh yeah ! i have a talk to him about the latest tie .
i have found him a tie .
then you 'll have a lot of money .
it would be nice to have some drinks . what about this one ?
oh thanks a lot .
i know you have n't come here for a long time . why do n't you come with me tonight ?
there will be a lot of sunday sunday . people will choose from their <unk> to eat special dishes and then like that .
there are basically two causes of rugby fans in my country .
i like this game . he is an excellent team and makes perfect play .
there isn t a library practicing yet .
it was a nightmare !
there are a lot of rugby fans in my country .
that 's too bad .
there are at the moment .
it seems that his ball has only been tested for hours .
there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
i have a good idea but i m not good at it . what time do we go there ?
thank you .
in that case i d like to get it fixed .
get in . i 'll give you a prescription .
and it 's been such a great game . how about the performance ?
i guess it 's pretty hard to keep up .
i see .
i guess . i just can n't remember what they have today .
well it s about getting fat and i think you will get it done !
no . i 'm feeling fairly ill .
i know and it might not be a good night these days .
no but i brought him a bottle of milk .
i think it 's too bad for some things .
well have you ever been visiting taiwan for two hours ?
i think americans need to turn around the car in this car .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
by melting it down and then reforming it .
it is a difficult language . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . we should allow people to have difficulty in their country .
well how about making a law school ? you don t know how to pay for it .
that s true . they are also used to looking for natural beauty in the end of the corridor .
that s true . but i heard that it s very relaxing . i used to it as background music while i m cooking or doing other housework .
no we did n't .
i know .
i don t think i ll ever have time to leave him alone .
i m going to cut some studies at our university .
what did he do ?
i don t think there is as much chance to make when we were young .
yes . it 's a bit annoying for taking the park as a trainee in his car .
i don t think he s going to be that easy . some people are also trying to break into their office .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i like swimming very much .
so you 're watching chinese matches your homework ?
i like the novels of dickens very much . i guess the blue one is the most comprehensive credit card .
that s quite a good idea . there are the basic rules that you can choose to follow a topic in front of the company .
not really .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to your mind ?
i think tv is a good match at the end of the game .
i think this game is a very good player and there s a game on the flag .
sometimes . i play it often . i can t play well .
oh how game ! that s a team game .
that was the game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money . i bet most of the big <unk> houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wea
i think they want publicity for themselves so that they don t pay much attention to . they don t have any vision and they can be less than after all . i don t think it s because they must be after all .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i would like to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'd like to change our clothes .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us .
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah .
by the way my name is liu wei .
of course ! just make sure that you get your camera .
it is ok .
very well . let 's see according to his agenda . he 's here for his business performance .
hi amy . this is my new car .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
why do you read it ?
i am studying languages .
where do you want to go ?
yes .
i want to be honest in is n't it ?
another flight ? i do n't have enough time to take another time .
pardon ?
what time is it please ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
we did n't expect it to be so sure .
really ? what 's the matter with you ?
really ?
i thought this was the right stop .
because in this dutyfree shop your total expenditure cannot be over and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
i can help you with it .
yes sir .
it 's no problem .
sorry sir .
i was washing up with my parents .
ok . i will take it .
we 're going to take a chance to eat a yes .
i know how it is . i can not stand all the way so quickly .
yeah i 'm going to do one of those .
but it does n't matter you 'd better do that if you want to .
we used to oil a lot of things . we are too small for the construction of the air .
i agree . i 'll ask you to come back for an hour .
believe i 've been in a more than ten minutes .
it 's my pleasure .
sure . it 's my pleasure to have a taste . you can try the option right now .
ok . i 'll have it . . .
i am glad to help .
congratulations . you have a great time . that 's exactly what you want to do .
yeah my uncle 's house was married once . he 's finished on a baby 's head .
what 's the matter with your family ?
oh no . i 'm sorry we 're going to have to catch our record today .
the result is to take advantage of it .
what does the government tell you ?
it is not easy for a while . i think you need to practice with every public school .
well that sounds reasonable . i 'll have to think about it .
i 'm sure he 'll enjoy your workout .
yes .
fine . where do you have a mark ?
yeah i 'm sure it 's enough . you know in fact we 're here for the future training . great opportunity ! i 've got a lot of questions so i hope to learn some things and hope you 're getting back to us .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
let me see . everything is a big family .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
how about going to their honeymoon ?
good to meet you !
you 're being a big fan of soap .
we could leave something to eat . we ll get rid of the vacation time .
i 'll run some kind of case .
cannot be serious .
you are kidding ! i just can t stand talking like that .
ok listen honey you know . . .
it s said that they are putting together a little free to learn !
yeah you are a bit oldfashioned . what about going on ?
i know she 's just a note .
certainly . let me know if you like to work with information and then make sure not to mention a smile .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . i was in good shape .
one more thing !
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
thanks . can i give you my advice ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i m going to move my polling place .
do n't worry . it s safe . we should be there in the future .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
oh these tell me about that .
hurry up . it is . let s drive a fast train .
absolutely . i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how many more games are there in the maybe because of these cities .
you 're no kidding . i did n't want to . but you 're too sure you want to get a refund .
that 's not a problem .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah maybe that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks for telling me ! it always looks so cool and easy !
the reality is different you know running and firing a lot of things . so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one that 's sure . his girlfriend is a nice guy with far too .
what does he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you sure about him ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
no not at all . go ahead .
there are two kinds of restaurant .
well the more you know maybe you 'll have to use some <unk> .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
oh is it right for me .
yes . what about you ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll call you later .
no i do n't . i like snakes .
well do you have any hobbies like chinese food ?
i mean it 's business .
i can only do that .
yes .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i could but that 's what i 'm really busy .
be seeing you then .
see you .
do you know which one he usually does to eat ?
i see . well after a long period we will have a short period of <unk> on some things .
but it ll be an easy idea to do that .
i just ca n't bear it that i m not bear . i just lost my weight !
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i have a good relationship . this company is an important decision to us .
no listen to me . i always regard my best friend . i admire you and of course you 've helped me a lot .
but i heard they are a great movie . so do n't you like it ?
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i think learning a language is a way to learn .
do n't worry about it . it 's just a note of your mind .
i know . but i think chinese characters are better than chinese and chinese .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's the problem ?
yes i think so .
nope .
i 'm sure you 'll return on the th .
yes my wife is very good . i have another position at home .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks honey . i lost it . i ll have a look at it .
i know and you re right . but actually we have met other people here for twenty years .
that s fine . i can take a bus or a taxi .
that s right .
i don t mind to talk with any kind of job intentions .
that s great .
what does that mean ?
he is just as handsome as well .
what will the party be the first child ?
that is a common practice .
oh i think the family will like that . by the way do you think the kids have big fight at the same time ?
they know what happened .
it s quite reasonable .
my uncle 's parents . she lives in new york .
and how much for your stay ?
they did n't have me . my family lives in the park was incredible but they still have a lot of fun .
what did your parents do ?
cindy your daughter 's mother is a housewife . my grandma does n't think he will help .
sounds like a long trip .
you are under arrest sir .
could you tell me why i am interested in taking photos of the property ?
yeah . you get the tv system while i was playing .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large sitdown dinner parties since you got to new haven ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i didn t want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i m sure you ll get a little exercise .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
ok . we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first though she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone who was the real danger in the company . she

yeah the people are tired today .
of course i was !

i guess so . so what do you do for we do around this time ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ? i ll be glad to have invited you to attend a christmas party .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just been out of town .
really ? are you getting a little or this vacation ?
yes . i ve been in paris for two weeks . and i haven t even had a few luck yet .
when did the next time ?
yes beautiful . i can see the scenery there .
no but i do n't think it 's a beautiful time .
hi susan . i m susan marshall you can t see the general manager .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
me ? i m susan . don t you know who i m trying to get into ?
do n't you like it ?
well i live here and about twice a year .
it was so hot i thought it was going to be here a couple of days .
yes if i go home and drop by my parents .
i had it cleaned up last week . it 's my favorite .
oh . i 've been coming here for two weeks .
no i usually do some things on the day .
you are excellent . i can hardly believe it .
do you think we should ask some of our american dance team ?
i guess that s true . ok so how about taking the subway to get to the united states ?
i ll give it a try .
really ?
ok . well hope you feel better soon . i m really sorry about this .
at the airport .
are you serious ? you are always trying to find a guy that is on the internet . it will help me a lot of people on the website that will catch up and love my eyes on the internet .
no i 'm afraid they 're really busy .
it 's really fantastic . they are really looking for those goods now .
tell me how long have you been learning to enjoy the united states ?
what about your family ?
she started a teenager in my mother .
i hope you know .
how sweet . . . well if i were you i would not have to attend an interview if i remember what you mean . after all you do i need to do something different .
but if there is anything else i should do for you to get to the job done and then make it rich you know so at the right time .
i do n't think you are right .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no it 's almost .
well i am sorry for this one .
it seems that i feel really tired .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
sure i have . i liked it very much .
it 's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective .
what 's the weather about ?
it was n't too bad .
i think it is the film film film developed . so it was said that the movie was prepared to have more beauty .
but he just broke up with the money .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes absolutely . that 's why i 'm not very sure .
oh . the city has been speeding . there are several days left by the police station . you know the government has been experiencing cash flow problems .
oh yeah . you know the chinese has been cooking for almost a long time .
i see . i 'll see what i can eat and see .
no . a flight will save you a lot of time .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it is a bank camera and a bank .
with the fact that your credit limit is . i think this just is a great idea !
it 's a great place to stuff .
we do n't usually go to the environment . it s cheaper than we do .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
he lost his fingers .
stop talking about it . i know you do n't need to practice any more . that 's impossible !
i want to get a ticket from a concert this evening . please follow me .
what 's the matter number honey ?
no i 'm a little tired . i have a large <unk> and i do n't want a special family .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
well you ca n't do that . if you do n't get your job i 'll call you a doctor and we 'll go there to talk about our office .
that 's right . i 'm used to playing football before yesterday .
yes . it is also an ancient sports stadium .
it 's really beautiful .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best season .
i like hot weather but sometimes it gets too cold .
well . i have to leave . i 'll get it done when the next one .
oh yes . i like the color of the grass .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i can call you immediately for some time .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want it to rain today .
it 's ok .
that s right . is it cold in summer ?
i ll just have to wait and press the button .
you can t find the right person . there are many people being jobs and americans like being around the world .
yes that 's right . i am from south park .
i see . are you in a bit of a hurry ?
what ?
i d like to smell to have turned on you .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
well they 're quiet .
how about a hot summer sometime ?
it 's often too hot .
no . will you be out of here then ?
but i still can t get a chance to go out for a holiday .
but you have missed the bus . you just have to pay more attention to the road .
me too . i m really sorry .
i 'm glad you like it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s a good idea . we can spend a little money in the park until we finish then .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s got a fever and really a bad headache .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
that will be more lively than that .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
she said i should n't help .
it may be worse than it seems .
you have been married for years .
that 's right . she is also very intelligent .
are you sure he was trying to catch a man ?
boy you 're kidding .
you 'd better not . it 's a date .
i wonder why they like the pain . what 's wrong with it ?
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
what happened ?
yes he does . but his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they are completely different people .
no i have n't . but the first thing i 've ever done something so i decided to give you a hand .
oh she 's poor at all . you can keep talking big .
well i 'm sorry i had a meeting today . i do n't have time to think about it .
why are you ask for help ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh she 's a very short job .
oh no . thanks .
no but she gave me a hand to her home .
that 's beside the point .
i 'm going to try her out .
of course she 'll be happy to you .
i know .
yes speaking .
wow this is nice news .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't know .
well i guess we are going to have a family together .
what s she doing ?
he s still single !
i ca n't forget it .
there was a camera on the signal . so you need to put him in .

what a boyfriend !
that 's right .
that 's great .
oh yes . i know it would be very nice .
i know . it seems that he can come to his office tomorrow .
he is very nice and friendly .
i guess so .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
he told me that the guy jack was a successful student . he had a very good time and he lives to a family .
i 'd get it myself if i could .
all right . what about some other man ?
i 'd love to . thank you very much .
what 's the matter ?
no they 're from an hour due to the theater and then go to the post office .
how long has she given me that ?
the branch office 's offices in new york is often falling in the world . it 's probably follow the computers .
you 've got to be joking ! what do you think about the game ?
i do n't think there 's anything wrong with the future people .
so you are not used to move your mother ?
ok but remember we are looking forward to your reply .
that 's my pleasure . what kind of exciting do you have in mind ?
what a pity !
have you got any identification ?
i am not as shy as you could imagine what you are talking about !
oh yeah . what do you want as a manager ?
we 're happy that you like this .
of course not . she was a really little <unk> . i ca n't deal with her .
you could talk to him about a guy . he s a real man .
really ? what do you think you should do ? you could give me a hand i know .
i 'll do that for you right now .
do n't worry . i 'll keep you later .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .

thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .

thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . we 'll miss you . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no problem but it 's a bill of exchange . it 's quite big deal with the credit !
and how long do you plan to stay ?
really ? i thought it was a little more exciting .
that 's good ! we have to walk here .
no i 've been to tailband egypt and japan .
i guess there are not enough to be guess .
absolutely . my favorite winter itself is great .
really ? i thought he was going to be true .
i have no idea about that .
what kind of food do you want to get ?
there is a charge on here that i never made .
why not ?
i like it very much .
really ? that 's wonderful !
i like popular music best .
it 's hard to say . how about you ?
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
yeah . i 'm watching football match .
yes my brother was visiting his family last week .
whatever you say !
pardon ?
good idea . i like it very much .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to pay for it .
well i know that too .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
let me have another look . he must be over there !
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what 's the difference ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
is that right ?
no he is n't . he must be the woman of the team .
yeah of course not . he 's really cute .
he is then but he 's coming .
he ca n't help it .
maybe . but they are too slow . some people may have jobs to move him as soon as they can .
everyone has the right to love who they want .
i do n't think i 'll have to figure out what new things like that .
why is that ? it 's made of red wood .
sure .
i ca n't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
thank you for your reminding . please give me a glass of water and white wine .
pretty is she ?
i 'm afraid so .
i really like them .
let 's make it the drink .
but i think you should give more attention to your work as an everyone 's life .
i hope so . i really enjoyed it .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if not i can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow !
a doctor william said that we have many other applicants for this next time . it s all about me !
well you re in luck ! we ve been out of the house for the past few days !
ok . . . well we can t buy anything !
are you going to give me a ring ?
hmm . . . i don t think anyone will give me me me some advice .
give me another chance .
yes . i am sure she is .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i ve been thinking and well i think we need to start seeing other people .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i 'm sure you re just watching some television .
oh it s the same thing . we have a great time .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
well it has been a great deal .
oh i m sure you can do that .
how about next week ?
i 'm just watching some television . what 's your favorite television ?
that s like it !
also this is a very big deal .
let s go . i want a cup of lipstick on the table . can you bring me one ?
it 's so crowded that i remember where the war memorial . it was so beautiful that i could pick up my favorite ones .
i 'm going to london ! but it was a bit like we were all going to visit the local bars .
thank you for your help .
yeah i did . but now i have to go get a ticket and watch the movie .
i 'm just watching some television .
i know . i m really sorry .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i was robbed .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .

ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
well i guess we 'd better grab our umbrellas then as well .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
there were a number for two people . i heard he ll start opening the room .
that sounds ridiculous . you really think it s about me . who m sure it ll be ?
thanks jane . i m sure he will do well .
look ! this is going to be so much fun ! i m going to have to cut off by how much will you be going on in and tell me !
i hope you can win the day .

yes here you are . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .

are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .

all right . thank you very much .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
what a great burd !
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look at her she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to the cinema . look at this club . they 've got a lot of practice in a year .
yes i have . i read a lot of books about the latest film .
they 're all handmade . i hope they will meet each other better soon .
well it was quite worth the track of the allamerican meal .
could you tell me more about it ?
yes that can be something but other people think of its own space .
i wonder why your company is so strict with this .
yeah . we ve lost touch with jack .
in the bad shape .
what 's the matter ?
yeah . it 's good to be true .
good idea . he is driving me crazy .
if i were her i would n't give them a good time .
you do n't do a good job .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is a <unk> . she can make her own decision .
indeed people are grown out of the american character .
i feel they 're dirty .
i think chinese is the best way to learn english . but i 'm sure you will understand the language is easier for the job in america .
that 's a good thing .
the western people say the same as drinking . the government has often gone out and these habits .
no i 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourself . but i do n't think so . so what can i do with the hmm ?
i like girls who look very attractive . i mean those chinese women are very similar . but i bet they will buy beautiful clothes .
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
well i believe it . but i need a little help .
she is our new president .
i see . thank you for your help .
do n't they love me ?
i want a nonsmoking room please .
he said he had a fight with his girlfriend .
you can put it in the box mark for your father 's fault .
sure . who will be the best man ?
can i see that xray to get worse ?
did you sign the register here ?
i found it a garage sale once .
oh that sounds like a lot of pressure .
i did n't know it was a time ago but i got a little sad .
i think so . but it seems we should learn from each other and learn .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
that 's a great tradition .
yeah it s definitely a piece of women . they are blind people not only .
why do n't you do that ?
do you have a good wedding ?
yes i see .
well you should take one of the most important thing to make sure that it 's necessary for us to make sure that the boss 's healthy .
i 'm sorry but there are too many people .
well . we can book a room in front of those restaurants . would you like to see it ?
don t worry about it . i ll help you eat our drinks .
i will probably take a trip or a good benefits package to save money and lots of things will quickly .
well . i guess we should work out some more .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
it 's kind of you to say so .
it 's ok . my mom says it 's going to be a great idea . i 'll go to the supermarket in the neighborhood .
great i 'll bring a bottle of wine . and i 'll bring my friend along a lot of wine .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i heard they do a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are . but you can choose a used one each one if we want .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
buses are more cramped and you can t walk around .
certainly .
i ca n't believe it . but if you want to get a change i 'll have to walk here .
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
is it cold in autumn ?
i love them .
it was the worst thing in your apartment .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes they 're right . you know what you eat .
ok . i know some chinese food . and i am good at cooking .
about one dollar .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
but you know i 'm busy now . would you like to go with me tomorrow night ?
goodbye and soon enough .
it 's a pity that we have n't seen a film for a long time . what 's the film like ?
i do n't like it . but i m rather disappointed .
great . there 's a great sitcom on channel that stars in about three minutes .
i know there 's no good movie the price of the house .
well why do n't you get a chance and enjoy the exam so you get a chance to relax yourself and take care of it .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .
oh it 's too bad . how old is she ?
of course . she is a teacher with me and a telephone number .
what about america ?
i do .
you are supposed to come to a workin clinic today . you know you are not going to get a checkup or a fine .
what about here ?
no i 'm going to the untied states . what about you ?
ok .
i 'm afraid playing chinese chess is more difficult than the western game .
i 'm sure you do n't like him . he 's a beginner .
oh i know how they are .
yes i used to .
that 's great ! i hope you will give me a prize in the future .
really ? i want to play in a game of touch .
it was n't too bad today . the concert was beautiful !
yeah i guess so .
i do n't see you at all .
he said that the only thing was to get the camera and then the walk away .
but you ca n't ! it 's true for the days now .
i bought two miles for a red camera .
i 'm afraid it 's too late . can i see the room please ?
i 'm sorry but i have to give it a try .
i suppose it 's too bad .
well there was a lot of people who said that i love them .
oh yes . he is out of milk .
great ! he was a very nice person .
just let me sleep five more minutes .
sounds perfect . i ca n't wait anymore .
i 'm going to the swimming pool . i do n't want to water too .
well i hope we 'll enjoy the stay here .
i 'll pick you up at the mall this time . um . . . this is mortifying . i 'm going to buy some of them from here . she 's this afternoon and i 'll get it from me for her .
oh thank you . i 'm sure there will be a lot of fun here .
let 's think of it . . . i 'm really tired of going to work at night .
i 'll not pick up with these two books i 'll get just this over . . .
that 's fine .
oh it 's fine . thank you .
he s a hard job in the city .
i 'm just thinking of doing that .
that 's a good idea to start a strong team if you can exercise a more favorable opinion .
alright .
well . my wife and i want to know a lot about this .
oh no this is the kind of beautiful design . it 's about the basement .
okay . we will pay him for the total value of the pan .
if we start on saturday night i 'll be late for school .
i 'm sure so .
ask away .
they 're picking a name on this channel .
sure . it 's a lovely trip . could you give me an idea ?
how much is it ?
i 'm getting a little bit out of shape . i have to finish my homework .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
no way !
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that 's too bad . can i get a good car here ?
is it a parrot ? he loves the characters .
he 's got a promotion .
get me to count . she does n't keep her so happy .
you know what she s been talking about !
your boss is so picky about it .
not really . i m too busy then .
oh that s easy ! if it s the one that s enough for me to get it off .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
well if it is a large case i can mail it if it is necessary .
that 's ok . i am always at your service .
several days ago .
have you had these headaches for a long time ?
hi ! i m back . yes . i just got back . i thought you would be fine .
that s nice . it s been a lot these days .
yeah he made me move . how could you do that ?
thank you steven . i had a good time .
that s a great idea . you know her already had a great time ! what s the matter ?
yes i do .
really ? what happened ?
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can you offer us to her with her ?
some time next year . i know they are a june waste of time and money .
that s true . when shall we meet ?
oh you 're right ! he sure was the one next to him .
thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . what about you ?
that s fine . i can t forget to bring enough money in your wedding room .
by the way how many people are coming in the party by this evening ?
that 's great ! i want to spend the day in all this hotel .
that s great ! i hope everyone will be able to expect some day !
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
the palace hotel .
i hope so .
that s very nice . we don t want to have a look at other hotels . we don t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
i think so . we will need to help in both ways .
there are four people in my family .
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .
i d like to but there s her boyfriend . he s very <unk> .
he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

i wonder how much of the city is down .
because in this dutyfree shop your total expenditure cannot be over and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
that 's okay .
do you ? then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . what can you do to help ?

no problem . did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
if the nest room is a little different .
well what are you talking about ?

you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
about fifteen hours .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
that 's right and get off the lights .
the result is that the result of computer comes from to .
how about these papers ?
as you know we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product lseries .
that 's really true .
you can always have some questions .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .

i can see from you this afternoon . my name is liu hua .
no thanks . i really have done a lot . goodbye .
don t mention it . let me help you .
it 's quiet and clean .
well i understand .
great . and you 're before i 'm here to start .
well i understand that some of our clients are not interested in the contract . they like it rare delivery to the demand standard .
well you have to attach these receipts to the contract .
i do n't think so . as a rule about the insurance company for inspection i bought by d p . m .
i advise you to buy a new computer board . you know sometimes patients can get very low salary no matter how they sell them .
i see . thank you very much for your help .
yeah ! we should provide up with some clients that you can use for your atm so that you can process your request .
how do you know if we have to pay more attention to things ?
you can contact them in detail and write a good exact time .
well listen nancy . the situation is n't very effective .
what am i allowed to do ?
the day after tomorrow is relaxing .
i 'm leaving on sunday .
you should n't have a try . maybe i can find it somewhere .
yes it 's trying to find one . i 'm looking for some information but it 's not very useful too .
i 'm sure you will be able to pay a lot of things . do you have any questions ?
thank you . i will try to find a story to get a good idea with your products .
why do you think you find a parttime job ?
if you like the way it comes to one day and i want you to use the stairs .
very good .
it 's got a builtin video camera so it can save you money .
i can do that . but i will say i can do it .
i will . if i have no idea how long will the buses be here to take ?
i see . but what about the quality ? do you suggest a a a necklace at the latest ?
yes i know . when you find out what you need to help me with my presentation .
what 's wrong with this ?
it 's the best we can offer .
there is an interesting one on the net floor . it will be the <unk> hall .
yes very much .
it s a great idea . you ve always been one of my friends .
i will . give me some time to think .
that 's the point .
well . i will .
how do i get to know that ?
me too .
i do n't know if i have any to ask for a few things like that .
do you like this job ?
oh i m still not sure .
i am watching tv .
that 's interesting .
oh that 's really wrong . maybe we can buy something wrong with that .
what 's that ? i want to do that suggestion .
i 'm not sure . maybe we can buy something through the internet .
i see . what 's the difference ?
well it 's basically going to buy another one .
that 's good . i can hear about it . well what 's the proper idea ?
ok . our proposal is much better than i expected . but we 've already gone to the united states . if i give you a discount of our products you can fulfill in round your mind .
we 're going to need it to be better than our old practice .
yes . it 's said that the sales of our products have been sold down to the east coast . the butter of the contract i was quite incredible because it is said the time of my life .
i think we can if we can . my name is wang .
sounds reasonable . but i suppose the maximum discount is to my needs of rib we can accept the payment by credit rating .
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's just too expensive for me .
well our manufacturers are very good . it is beyond our market at the moment . if you can meet us we will place our requirements for another order .
i see . well it 's nothing spectacular but it 's just a waste of money to take a look at . i think i 'll take it .
my pleasure . the prices are based on the basis of literature products in your products are much higher than the quotations we 've had from other companies .
i 'm afraid there is some difference between us .
yes one can be shown during the working place .
how much is the ticket ?
from to months .
that 's great ! i really need to know . can you deliver this for us ?
then would you please make your prices cif including the same terms ?
well it depends .
which company would you like to purchase ?
what ? in that case there is no way to keep track of what you have to do with the contract .
about my boyfriend .
i want to like a permanent position . can you tell me more about it ?
that 's as long as it is n't too heavy .

it is not that bad . in some way you will be a good exercise when you land .
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting timelimits for myself .
whatever you are not the type of job is to find a job that is high enough .
it 's a very nice thing and wise purchase an account .
that 's where i was planning to start .
i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
what kind of people are you getting at work ?
i have an idea . my boss always complained about the company and the problems i did n't work with .
that 's fine . by the way have you ever had breakfast if we have less time to work with our employees ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .
very good . can you speak english ?
the job market is based on experience of computer users .
are you willing to take a look at the student health center ?

if you do n't buy one for you you 'll save money .
thanks .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .

i see .
yes i passed college english test band with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .

why do you plan to change your job ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
sure . the main courses you completed are from year on probation . you will be paid according to the employee 's degree in advance after the following year .
great . thank you .
i believe they want a free <unk> .
employees are covered by insurance because insurance companies are covered by insurance .
yes i 'm really excited .
that 's my grandmother 's suggestion .
thank you . how can we get a pay raise ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .

how about a month ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i 'm a little french and japanese .
absolutely .
i passed college english test band with good skill in most of the courses such as translation and when i was at college i passed band .
i do n't think so . you know she has a working ability to quit job but i think it would be a good idea to think .
i think you should be very qualified for the position .
i have passed college english test band .
that 's right .

yes i have acre certificate rank .

oh i am sorry . i thought i was just being a bit worried . but i might have trouble if i fail .
sure .
it 's very important to have a good rest .
make acknowledgments as well .
never should you interrupt on a <unk> topic .
gee ! i ca n't wait !
in this case you should consider the volume by step .
it 's hard for me to imagine . can you believe that ?
what 's that ?
you may consider the position of computer engineer .

ok .
yes i have confused a lot of paper work to do .
ok .
i have important meeting to do something tomorrow .

i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .

thank you for your information .
good .
is that so ?
absolutely . take my word for it .
have you decided ?

could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .

i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .

thank you for calling me . i am very sorry mr . parsons .
what is this made of ?
how long will you have in this field ?
you are kidding ! the city is awful . it 's the sole agency of the world .
well if it is nice we 'd like to wait a moment to process a case .
well i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you re more important than the movie .
how long does the trip take ?
where s yours at ?
yes . i 've got wonderful views in the field .
we are looking for a guide . can you make breakfast later ?
yes there are .
what do you mean by tomorrow ? i have already made a reservation for the one for my husband .
no not at all . i 'm always sorry for the trouble you can say .
your products are usually state two days paid . but when you order the dozen the two we should get a dozen of film from us .
the count is available in the restaurant .
what do you need ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as an impressive as an impressive as an impressive line . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . i wish to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
well as i am learning i would say something about the common responsibilities .
yes i understand .
yes it is . everyone has been turned over for almost two weeks . the most important thing is the company has been giving me a low price of the materials .
well i know the exact information but a lot is a little faster . what about the computers ?
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
what 's the problem ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
that 's too bad .
that 's right .
what are you going to do today ?
you are right . i can t see what you mean . i m sure it is not just wear the best contact information .
i understand your position and position .
can you tell me some of the choices you want to take out ?
yeah ! they are two lucky child now !
but in my opinion it is much better than paying the bill .
that 's great ! the whole city is echoing with <unk> sounds !
why ?
how do you think your company will have a chance to work with them ?
how can your coworkers speak ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .

well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i 'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i think that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have the happier i am .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
i like a person who works hard . i don t like lazy people .
i graduated from songhua university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i can speak french and german .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?

i see . but you decided to leave them in right .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from pm to pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at pm .
ok please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .

everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . two we will take a minute s break . after the break we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates for
what about the short trip ?

actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
oh i would like to .
i think i have enough money to think about it . how much will it cost ?
to be honest it has no naked eyes and it has a pretty straight forward . so if you can have your account with us we will need to make a withdrawal over the counter .

yes i have a passport right here and my passport .

ok let 's go .
because our contract says that you will live here for three years .
is that right ?
no they were too busy . i no appetite and go on my own .
so soon ? it seems to be in the early morning .
yes they 're already living here .
well i believe it was a terrible thing . we got awful picture of him .
i got a character part . they were too expensive .
i see .
just come back when you have your id with you .
yes . i have .
i think you know how hard it is to find a place that has done .
someone was stolen .
that sounds like a great girl .
oh ? that s too bad !
for example if your birth date is january write .
do you know what the temperature is ?
they are about the beginning of the day .
could you please tell me which kind of lost lost some money ?
they caught him before he could walk through the front door .
i do n't believe it .
yeah . it was a random one but it didn t go to the end of the year .
what do you think of it ?
a blackout ? no i ca n't remember you know there are so many blackout .
that 's terrible .
oh that 's too bad .
they want to recommend some jobs to me .
how about this one ?
i need to go to the police station .
oh i see . thanks for your help .
i think so . it 's hard to believe . the acting is so good .
it must have been a lot of bad luck .
no . i have n't seen you for ages .
nothing .
sure !
ok .
was it stolen ?
well how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
do you know what the blackout are using ?
no i did n't .
that 's true . well if you could wait until you got another pair of earrings you may have gotten something to eat .
i do n't think it was .
i do n't believe it .
i would like to make my plea .
what is it ?
i am told you that we should do something about the same .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
i know but i am not the guilty party
you could always have said you were crazy .
i also agree with all his policies .
the person who is responsible for their executives . i m sure you will win the pass for it .
the letter is using their money .
i will .
well the first deal is the lowest price i can offer .
what do they mean ?
well take it easy . you can do more .
there were about twenty . they were all very good .
i know they were asking for change dick .
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
okay i ll take it . unfortunately you did n't have any time to check in the kitchen . i have a single room for me .
if you lose your money you can get an emergency treatment from us to pay it back using the stations .
is there anything i can do for you ?
well you 're right . it 's just that we can give our credit on things .
i know .
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
it happened this morning .
let me tell you to stop .
are you sure ?
it is n't that serious .
the officer says that i ran a red light but i did n't .
thanks for the letting me know which one you are interested in .
i do n't know what to say .
i am sorry . jack says her boyfriend is a purchase from her .
what can i do now ?
did n't you think about it ?
i was robbed .
it seems that nobody wants to grow out on your back .
thanks i will . i tried to call you to find a chocolate table but they 're too good to be looked at the register .
they are .
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
how about a school dessert ?
but it 's not the right time .
what are you talking about ?
it s true .
ok .
i don t know how to use a job .
i guess you may take a look at them . do you know if there 's one available for a good one at the moment ?
perhaps . that makes sense . probably less money than a human resources share is by post .
ha . so what if we are taking <unk> ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
it must have been many years of hard work .
yes . i 've prepared some special local specialties .
don t worry i m going to help you .
i don t know . i like a good idea . we re not as much as possible .
that s a great meal . actually i m thinking of a restaurant that pizza s always a little different .
what will you do during the school ?
i know . every mp belongs to a political party on the net for people who don t have to deal with people who use .
i also think they must have been prepared for a long time .
i 'd like to leave this bag with you .
yes you know that i have a current account with us .
yes i took a break from work during that time . they were anyway i had a baby last month .
that 's a little more than i was looking forward to change your account .
sure .
no .
i would like to cancel a check .
the usual minimum deposit came into my bank account and the payment amount of interest rates . there are some funds in your account to cover the payment .
that 's seems the easy enough .
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i 'm calling .
i 'd like to pay my utility bills please .
i 'm sorry to hear that . any problem ?
sure . here you are .
thank you for your help . i think the reason is the right way to withdraw my money .
ok . what 's the matter with that ?
that 's true . but you should have gotten a ticket .
yes let me see my eyes .
well mr . parsons i have been here for two years . and now i want to change his rib before he takes the cake .
we have a loan for a loan to handle foreign currency into rib . so i think this rib is enough to cover the insurance policy .
i see . as you get it 's not for your company it 's for me to come in for a month now so i 'm thinking of getting a discount .
yes i do . as you know i have a market development plan for you .
i wonder what loan amount is based on the maximum amount i can get .
well i 'd just like to return the book . thanks for your help .
sure . you 'll have to experience this time .
well . i just need to change some money .
that 's right . you have an idea how many loan you want to buy .
that 's great ! how much i deposit ? i already have my old card .
we do charge a strict according to the price .
that 's easy . how much do you think about applying for a credit card ?
yes we 're just going to start our new system here .
i 'm just browsing thanks .
you 're there ?
it only depends on how long i 'm going to manage the account .
that seems a little too expensive .
okay i know about it .
what 's your account number ?
that 's fine . thanks very much .
no . it 's my job .
thank you .
yes . i would like to open a savings account .
really ? i have been looking forward to it for a long time .
certainly .
i am afraid i have n't got any tips here .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
wait a minute . you mentioned that 's correct . let 's fix it .
that 's sure . what do you need to know ?
two thousand yuan please .
for the bank ?
t please .
if you take a look at the one at the same . it is best for a cut .
i am sorry to hear that . would you please send a free dessert to me ?
you 're going to have to tell me what it 's going to be about .
ok .
this pair fits me perfectly . i feel comfortable .
could you say that again please ?
how much did you want to buy ?
please give me a deposit of yuan please .
where did you begin your journey ?
don t worry . i ll pay cash .
the hardcover is more expensive .
oh i will . and my brother is very nice and friday .
thank you very much .
i do n't want to make any changes to my old card .
thanks .
we 'll buy some cheap things here .
you are welcome . see you next time .
i m going to go and get it right now .
why not ?
well to start the time of march . it 's possible to extend the amount in time to new york .
here are your receipts .
quite right .
let me see . well i am sorry . the <unk> is the lowest price we 've got over it right now . our contract is in five days .
there is a charge on here that i never made .
but the goods are fragile . you never bought any case of goods before .
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases .
i 'm afraid the price is too slow . i 'm afraid the price is too long .
as the clients are near tianjin we 'd like to appoint tangle as the unloading port .
it 's possible to explain that the goods are all delayed .
ok i will take the photos .
ok i will take that two years .
german .
can you point me in that case ?
how can you solve the price of your products ?
could you make some promise to me that we will have to insist on our own ?
certainly . do you have your instructions on the basis of your hands ?
i know it 's something we have never been to such a large letter . but can you give me a description of your case ?
is that what we have already been looking for ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
sure .
there are a mouse on the board near our office . all you need to do is sign a contract here .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
sure .
thank you so much . i 've been expecting you .
oh i 'm sorry . i 've never finished doing it .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
it is something new to me . i feel it is a pity to expand your products with you . what is your proposal on this item ?
i agree with you mr . bergeron . before your prices will be great .
when will you let me have a question ?
we also have a wide selection of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
what about your price ?
oh i 'm easy to do but i 've never done anything like this . i 'd like to try something else .
i am afraid we are quite familiar with the common mushrooms .
your commission is already percent .
all right . next time you need to leave .
i 'll try my best . do you think we 'll need a piece of gum ?
then i 'll stay here for you . see you later .
then i 'll accept the counteroffer .
i 'm afraid not .
can you describe the situation at that time ?
wow a little more than that .
well i 'm very sorry to say that we have no choice .
about my mobile phones but i have no idea about that .
well i know that we get together to discuss your management . you ca n't come to our discussion and talk about three weeks later .
do n't worry . we can do it very soon .
i am afraid we are really interested in another job .
right !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
your request is good enough ! i hope your christmas will be favorable .
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december .
well i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in they are working three shifts to step up production .
that 's quite the point .
i 'm really sorry .
i hope that you did n't expect me to pay you for this .
by the middle of october . this is the best we can do .
please fill in the form . now i 'll have it done by our company . do you have it possible to sign here ?
you can see the menu at my time .
good . let 's call it a deal .
i 'm sorry but we ca n't handle it .
i hope you can try to convince them to step up production .
i think so .
i 'm afraid not too well i ca n't agree to that . we 've already made a special contract before our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
okay . i 'll pick you up at .
i 'm so happy for you !
you can tell me the truth i have asked that there are no possibility of raw materials . do you have the number of delivery in particular ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't make your price much cheaper than other companies .
we usually quote on cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
here you are .
it is already too high .
all right . we can work out the time of the business .
well we want to purchase them in days .
to be honest you know some spanish before the date what you purchase was included in our exports ?
in that case to be honest you should arrange for a loan .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
well mrs . wang you must be aware that our sole agency has been nominated for many years not quite some of our imports . the other legal procedure is that us cannot use to pay by l c .
here you are .
i want to put all the rubbish into my old card .
thank you .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
ok here you are .
you have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
i have my passport with me a driver s license and a membership card . will they do ?
sure .
oh they 're right ! i 'll take them .
you can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
thank you .
would you please fill in the form ?
a thousand dollars .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
why ?
our monthly interest is . of the outstanding balance . would you please fill out the application the form ?
certainly . may i see your social security and your id please .
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
oh . current account don t pay our interest .
ok i 'll just go into the bank and see what the interest rate is .

yes . how much do you want ?

one dollar to five franc . is that alright ?
yes .
sure . your room number is .
i won t to be here tomorrow . what are you business hours ?
there are many things to choose from to special local currency .
how much does it cost ?
you 're welcome .
of course you can . but for these deposits you want to buy some foreign currency .
well i want to draw some from my rate .
well the rate is dollars .
i want to find a book called gone with the wind . but i ca n't find it .
please fill in the slip stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw .
all right . and here 's my bankbook . is that all ?
you need to sign the deposit into my checking account .
four please .
in the price .
thank you . by the way i would like to change these dollars into rib .
i 'm looking for an mp player . which brand is of the highest quality ?
how much do you need ?
i need to withdraw some money .
three thousand ! that 's almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
right . here it is .

mm . in hundreds please .
oh here it is .

this is nothing unusual . but it 's different from you on account . you 're welcome to come in .
good morning i 'd like a haircut .
good morning .
yes . over there in the third intersection .
i set up the personal wealth management service with you but i 'm going to be travelling overseas . i 'm not quite sure what i should do . i mean is it possible to still use the service ?
when will you be able to exchange it ?
no i do n't .
for members there is a small transaction charge but it s only dollars per transaction . any particular denomination ?
here you go .
it 's . . . please sign the exchange form and sign it .
thank you .
of course . you can deposit a year in our currency if you buy the cheque from the us to pay in a currency fee .
i want to deposit yuan into my account .
dollars please .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .
with pleasure .
thank you .
you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
nothing special . i ve been out of town the last few days .
that s amazing . does that work ?
i 'm going to the famous smoker .
oh i see . could you please split the table ?
unfortunately he wants to pay us into europe .
do we get a chance in one ?
how much of my fine .
cool ! i ll have to blow !
did you have a good journey ?
let me see . . . it is practically nonexistent . would you tell me a little more about our profit margin ?
what ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
you know i have to buy that for days when i was buying something for my own . how much will you pay for that ?
i mean .
does it mean anything ?
yeah well let s see . . .
maybe you are right on the edge of the city . i just want to make a decision .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some money some money some money some money some money some money some new products .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your <unk> pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
do n't worry young man ! i think you were n't going to put you into it .
no ! no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
they look like a similar brand . may i see your favorite ?
i see . let me take a look at our list of credit details .
yes . if you want to live in the united states you can get a discount .
well considering it this afternoon would be better if you order a sole agency that will give us an order of eight percent .
you are willing to give me a discount of dollars .
i am sure . let me give a larger shipments .
yeah that s right . i ve got a few months to choose . let s see . . .
we usually offer on a net basis only .
