will it take me straight there ?
you 're welcome . bye .
thanks .
i 'll have to write you a ticket .
yes you can .
how long will it take to get there ?
well you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic is n't too heavy .
how much is it ?
sure . i will .
i bought it when i got a taxi .
oh i see it now .

of course .
oh thank you .
yes . you can the fitting room is right over there .

this one is better .
it 's yuan .
here is yuan . the charge is for you .
yes i am thinking about buying a secondhand car .
what size do you see ?
perfect !
it 's a brandnew seiko wrist watch .
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
there 's no charge for mileage . and fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included .
i do n't know .
i mean in the library or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for parttime positions .
that 's too bad .
well it 's a private one .
that 's true .
i 'm afraid not .
? no i 'm not really interested in this place . it is n't big enough . it is n't near enough to my office .
exercise is easy for you to make .
what a beautiful car !
it 's a month . it 's the biggest we 've got in this area .
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
is that your new bicycle ?

maybe you are right !
come on !

that sounds good . please bring it yourself .
yes i 'm excited to hear about your new product .

one moment please .
that s a good idea . are you sure ?
i have an idea .

i think that i can purchase that here . it is thanks for your help .
there are chapters in total .

do you have any idea about it ?
what did you mean ?
what 's the matter ?

oh here comes a bus !
no you can take the whole bus to the opposite direction .
thanks a lot !
yes but you ca n't get off at the next stop .
that 's too bad . thanks a lot .
do n't lose this receipt because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they do n't have the right paperwork .
i 'd like to withdraw rib from my corporate account .

goodness me ! what a choice ! i think i ll have a cappuccino please .

to make sure that the apartment is so cheap .
i know what you mean . maybe i can help you find something .
i was born and raised in beijing . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . i have worked there for years .
what do you think of the environment ?
i like irish coffee . but i do n't like it .
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also i quite like instant coffee .
i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect it 's really cheap and convenient .
exactly . nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?
which country makes the best coffee in the world ?
yes . no doubt about that . for us coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people do n't drink that much coffee .
no we do n't especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee .
i suppose so . that 's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in china now .
well you can take the no . bus from here but then you have to walk about minutes .
i 'll take a bus .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .

what is it ?
let me help you .
first of all i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i 'm doing a good job here ?
not yet . i am looking for a black suitcase .
here you are .
what 's the price for this one ?
<unk> . do you want some ?
that is a really wonderful idea .
they are very kind of you .
hey isabelle . . .
no . but he sure can remain .
that 's all right .
are you sure ?
why is that ?
oh i 'm glad to hear that .
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
oh yes you do n't need a space .
pine . that 's in san francisco is n't it ?

the next train will be here in four minutes .
yes that 's very kind of you .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
oh no .
i see .
that 's not the same kind of thing .
i did n't realize it was just yesterday .
i think you did .
is that all right ?
because i do n't want to smell bad .
whatever you say . i 'll take it .
hey !
well it 's my pleasure . how much is it ?
fine .
what ?
uh huh ? i had a bargain . . .
all right . i 'll take it .
she is an office assistant .
it 's as good as you .
she 's true .
good point . i hope it 's a good price .
no .
really ? what are you really mad about ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on <unk> fair . i <unk> upon this bag and bought it on the spot without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
wow you 're so lucky . . .
but do you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
have you got any questions ?
i know i 'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
yes it 's almost .
ok .
yes i think so .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that 's helpful for your health .
sure .
yes .
that 's right i have .
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
i 'd better hurry up !
i know . i am coming down with my umbrella . is that ok ?
ok .
who s calling ?
sure that would be great .
ok . bye .
yuan .
here you are .
sorry . i 'm afraid we do n't have any .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ?
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the saucepan the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes there is one at the traffic lights .
will you let me know where to get off ?
sure . it 's right now .
thank you .
i hope so .
thank you .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
you re welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
i know but i could n't finish it .
excuse me .
dad you 're kidding .
sure .
what a waste of time !
right .
don t mention it .
forgive me darling i had a quarrel with her .
why not ?
we had a home accident last week .
that 's why you did n't do that .
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's really terrible .
neither of us are .
tell me about it .
well they are too violent . i m not very worried about that .
yes sir . where to ?
oh no sir . where to ?
ok . let 's go in .
it 's a pleasure .
that 's all right .
that 's all right .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
what should we do now ?
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
ok we can stop at the officelicense to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we 'll do that on the way home so we do n't have to carry it the whole time .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms especially if the stores have special offers .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .
ok let s go then !
at the zoo wow ! this zoo is really huge .
for what ?
i ve got a business call that i really need to take .

i do n't know . . . well i guess i 'll take them since you do n't seem to have anything better .
thank you ma 'am . it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
i 'm looking for a sweater .
what size do you wear ?

i 'd like to have green tea .

ok .
and your name please ?
.
first of all i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i 'm doing a good job here ?
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
don t be so modest . i know you like it .
where shall we go then ?
don t worry about it .
it s ok with me .
so what s the problem ?

oh please .
thank you .
do you have anything to declare ?

.
what is your number please ?
it s michael jordan .
huh ?
sure .
thanks mr . smith . could you tell me your phone number ?
i have a problem with this bank .
where are you going ?
i am on route a few miles east of the university of utah .
what would you like to do ?
it 's red .
good . thank you very much .
sounds good !
what is your date of birth ?
how long does it take to get there ?
hello mr . smith . what s your telephone number ?
i 'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
is my vcr ready ?
yes .
thanks . oh it s terrific .
because i m not in the mood that s why .
well don t just sit there do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
yes ?
could i have one more blanket ?
why not ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i 'm sorry .
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i know but it is a easier said than done .
i didn t get accepted .
i am not surprised you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
yes i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class .
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
well i like them very much .
what 's the matter ?
thanks but i am looking forward to watching it .
i went to the cafeteria .

alright . may i have your name please ?
sure .
first of all i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i 'm doing a good job here ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds good .
hello ?
yes speaking .
where is it ?
that s true .
but i m very interested in this job .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't had much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
let 's do that .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
what happened ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . don t worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
are you in a hurry ?
i have to be there before .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's rush hour .

i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
thank you .
no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
must i catch a number bus to get there ?
no you need n't . a number bus will also take you to the hospital .
number buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you henry . i 'll get a number .

thank you very much .

well to be frank yes i do .
oh i m sorry . but this isn t a nosmoker is it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ?

sorry i made a mistake .
oh it 's really beautiful but i just ca n't do it well .

that s my problem . i don t have a lot of options .
so what ?
it looks like an old one but i do n't know anything about it .
how about cigarettes ?
well first of all i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
well you re in the right store . if they don t have it no one will .
alright . well i 'll have a try .
no i m not sure . i think about mph right ?
you 're not sure ? you were going at miles per hour ! that 's mph over the legal speed limit ! have you been drinking ?
no officer not at all .
then how can you explain your behavior ?
well i guess i just wasn t paying attention to the speedometer .
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
um because i was busy talking to my friend .
on a cell phone ?
yes i was using a cell phone . i just bought it so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs and um . . guess i had too many distractions .
that s definitely true . i m going to have to give you a ticket . please remember to drive more carefully next time .
i agree . i ll look in the paper .
a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop .

the ad says plus deposit .
when is the place available ?
it s available now and it s got a very good location . you won t be far from work .
oh you didn t know that apartments here are considered valuable even if they are small and crowded ?
of course i had heard about that but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here .
i don t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
yeah but so what ! i m proud to live in the world s most exciting city . and the salaries here are the highest in the nation too .

the ad says plus deposit .
that s amazing . the rent is very cheap .

i think you would be right !
why is that ?
no you can t do it .
i can t believe it .
let me think about it .
can i help you ?
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .

you 're welcome .
thank you . i won t miss it .
i m worried about my daughter . she can t decide about college .
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .
why is that ?
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
maybe you re right .
not bad . there s a new english teacher .
oh what s she like ?
she is beautiful .
is she old or young ?
she is quite young and her hair is blond .
is she strict ?
not really . her eyes are blue .
can she speak chinese ?
not much . she is very tall and slim .
david stop dreaming . it s time to do your homework .

i m sorry jim .
never mind dear .
have i really got to do those exams again dad ?
of course you have . you must try harder this time .
and must i go back to school ?
no you needn t do that . you d better get a parttime job somewhere and go to evening classes .
but dad i should be working fulltime at my age . i m nearly .
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn t have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study .
what else i ve got to do ? join the army ?
who knows ! that might come to later .
can i help you ?
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
i ll be glad to help .
or maybe make the beds .
all you have to do is to ask for help .
thanks . that s terrific !
i m ready and willing to help .

well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .

why did n't you phone me ?
what s wrong with it ?

i 'm free .
yes ! thank goodness you 're here .
what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything .
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem . get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no problem .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got strappy sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes <unk> .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an <unk> shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a closedtoe shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want <unk> . i find slingbacks very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
sure let me take one .
medium please .
here we are . how does it fit ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my insoles . i don t think i have the patience for this today . they just don t make shoes like they used to . i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some <unk> and we ll take it from there .
yay !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don t forget the syrup !
what ? you don t know the first thing about gardening !
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
oh yeah ? tell me then <unk> pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a <unk> .
right . well it seems like you have all your bases covered . what s next ?
i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !

i need to cancel an account .
that would be great .
if you damage the video you will be fined .
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
oh well i see . thanks for your help .
how does friday sound ?
yes .
i am afraid so .
what is the problem ?
i am the manager . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
oh it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
yes i would .
why are you interested in watching it ?
i 'll be expecting you .
that 's all right .
your price is fine with me . where shall we go ?

how much would you like ?
how long would it take ?
yes i am .
oh yes !
are you serious ?

i like it but there is one problem .
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
i am not feeling well .
what 's the problem ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
is that all ?
i will take a look at it .
where s your polling place ?
we 're quite busy right now .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
how about this one ?
great . thanks for asking .
i appreciate it .
i would like to deposit some money .
yes .
that would be fine .
because that is not what i can do .
i would like to do that right now if we can .
why do you have an appointment ?
that would be great .
okay . see you then .
what else can i get for you ?
well i like it but i did n't think of it .
i like the apartment right now .
not at all .
what is it ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
why is that ?
that s great . you can count on me right now .
you should check the connections .
with the swim stations ?
are you serious ?
that s right .
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the ad says plus deposit .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what do you mean ?
well to be honest i think the price is higher .
my exam .
what is good for you ?
a month ?
well that 's not a good idea .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at .
i had a home inspection before i wanted to share the home inspection .
i think that a lovely idea .
can you call the home inspector ?
the cops are coming up on something .
i am not sure but the owners will fix them right now .
i can t think of anything else .
yes and the owners must fix all of them .
that 's good .
i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the secondfloor joist .
maybe you can find a roommate .
are you kidding ?
usually as a newcomer we are going to clean the alarm clock .
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
alright . i mean we can remove the carpet ourselves .
i think that you can save more money right now .
that will work out fine .
thank you . i think i can get something done .
what would you like to help me with ?
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the driveway .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no <unk> this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .

that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
give me a short haircut .

posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .

you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .

del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take it .

it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would <unk> whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .

oh yes .
what should i do ? i 'm afraid i ca n't .
you are right .

down to the basement .
i know what type of school is playing ?
i can teach you how to play badminton .
sounds like a good idea .
tell me what you need .
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
not really . they do n't seem to keen on watching tv .
thank you . what shall i do now ?
let me see . i like the books so much .
these books are just fine .
thanks for telling me . i enjoy it .
that 's nice of you .
that 's a good idea .
oh . that sounds great .
nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language is always difficult to learn .
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i m doing fine .
it was nice of you to say so .
i have a driver 's course .
engaged ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i think so too . i don t like him either . let s go and see what he s doing .
she 's proficient in both written and spoken english .
i have a good english teacher .
she is in the hospital with my dad .
do you think i should call her ?
yes . she was a psycho .
she is a pretty good teacher .
no she did n't .
that 's good .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
what are you going to do ? you have to cut the brain !
i really like it .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
no i did n't .
all right . thanks for your help .
oh no .
i feel that she is a teacher .
she was very busy .
for example ?
i major in chemistry .
really ?
i 'm afraid not . it 's just that there is n't anything i can do about it .
i 'll try my best .
yes .
honey . you 're right .
really ?
as a matter of fact we don t have any children .
no . only a few months ago .
ahahah . . . yeah !
i do n't know what to say .
twice a year ?
yes i have .
that sounds like a lot of fun .
wow you re really all out of town .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh it s two o clock . i must go now .
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
right .
do you know where it is ?
in private school .
oh i see .
oh to study in a private school .
what about children ?
in the schools there are very good too .
perhaps you 're right .
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i would like to return this book .
anything else ?
oh yeah . here you go .
when does the bus come ?
i apologize for the inconvenience .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
what if i can t meet that requirement ?
your fees total . .
i can t believe that .
what are you going to do ?
i will .
i have n't been able to watch my cable for the past week .
ok sir . may i have your name and your room number please ?
i have it right here .
what s the problem ?
i don t know why not .

do you have enough money ?
every option you can choose will appear on the screen . that s about it .
when will my passport be ready ?
about to minutes .
that 's all right .
do you need a car or off campus ?
i have both but i m not sure yet .
are you sure you can park in the car ?
i park in the daytime .
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ?
i park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .
pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . do you know what the curb colors mean ?
no i do n't know what the curb colors mean .
just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . i think you 'll be good to go !
yes . the fitting room is in the corner .
thank you .
i needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .
i have it right here .
good . now just complete this form .
no i do n't . how about this outfit ?
yes i am sure i can help you .
that s good . thank you very much .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
you really are so thoughtful that you have to join me today .
it certainly makes everything easier both at this end and at your end .
did you have anything to do then ?
no . but i 'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work .
what is your problem ?
thank you .
what was your speed then ?
all right .
i would also like a bag of chips .

what kind of weather are you going to use ?
oh no . i forgot about it .
sure . let 's go .
that 's right .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
here you are .
remember that you are in college now not high school .
what class do you want to register for ?
how about my driver 's license ?

i can t believe it .
i would like to take a driver 's course .

i feel the same way .
well why not ?
what 's wrong with it ?
got it .
why do n't you talk to him ?
but he 's not good at .
oh dear !
i really liked him too .
i m sure he is . he domed his own life .
who 's that ?
what s he like ?
wow ! it is so dangerous .
thank you . i 'll keep in mind .
what is good for you ?
will you tell me when we get back ?
no . he isn t .
yeah people say that he is going to be independent .
yeah . it s all right .
it 's true .
ok .
and he must be opening his home .
that is funny .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .

it 's ok .
hello jack .
i have no idea .
are you serious ?
thank you .
thank you . it s very nice of you to say so .

you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don t have to pay for my trip .
congratulations ! that 's excellent news ?
thanks . it s nothing special actually .
that 's what i 'm going to do .
i try to go to sleep .
what do you want to see ?
thanks .
but she is always as good as her mother .
what about the weather ?
i am completely serious .
you mean you 've got a great cook ?
you 're welcome . and this is my birthday .
you 're welcome .
yeah i know .
why ?
i must study first .
you 're kidding . i ca n't believe he 's broken !
you 're right .
he 's probably in bed .
let me think .
what 's it about ?
me too .
yeah .
yes .
yes . i m always glad to see what he is .
uh . . . glad to see you then .
it 's really good to finally it .
yes it is . but it 's not too late .
ok .
i do n't like that idea .
yes i did .
it was a good game was n't it ?
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ? what can i do for you ?
i m worried .
okay .
i 've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
what 's the problem ?
do n't worry it 's not serious . you will get better soon .
of course i will .
do you think she 'll be home ?
maybe .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
he is fine .
he s going to be sent to britain to study really ?
yes . he s already got the passport and visa .
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
thank you . he s very lucky indeed .
i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that 's okay .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i 'd like to travel very much .
yes it is .
what 's wrong ?
that means it is expensive .
yes you are right .
i am glad you like it .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid fingerpointing when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
my computer wo n't turn on .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
oh yeah you 're right . stop seeing them .
i wonder .
i see .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
oh it s a matter of course . i simply enjoyed it .
i do n't know .
no problem . i can t afford it .
oh that s nice of you to say so .
as you know it is .
that s great .
what do you think of it ?
you need to worry about it .
i know .
dave is a spy for webtracker ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
you are right .
thanks .
oh really ?
you are right . i 'll try my best .
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take <unk> during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
yes i have .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
sure . do you want anything else ?
i have a mistake .
he does n't matter . he loves his wife very much .
i bought it last month .
how long do you plan to go ?
yes . i ll give you your receipt .
there ! how does it look ? tell me if i 've got it straight .
right .
what s your books about ?
maybe you 're right .
i 'd love to .
where did you learn ?
but you have already made up your mind .
yes i know . but i have no one to lose weight .
ok . i ca n't do it well .
really ? what could i tell you ?
thanks for everything .
wow ! how nice !
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some languageexchange program ?
what is it ?
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i ll take this one .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh i just ca n't forget it .
anything you say honey .
that 's right .
it 's about the same in the city .
let 's go to another restaurant then .
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
yes i like .
anyway tell me about it .
oh no .
oh well thank you .
why ?
we can provide a private vehicle if you prefer .
really ? why ?
yes . i know .
yeah i have .
which one is the most expensive ?
and the songs are over there .
ok i guess it 's my fault .
film ? do n't you like it ?
but i 'm not sure if that 's the case .
i can help you with it .
stop talking like my mother . so it 's what she keeps saying .
what 's your parents opinion ?
well perhaps .
anything else ?
yes we bought yesterday .
maybe you are right .
please .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
all right . just a moment please .
there you are .
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some afterdinner wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in <unk> . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
stop talking like my mother . that 's what i eat .
cheers .
let me take a look . are you interested in it ?
we are going to visit west . what about you ?
really ? i 'm sorry . i did n't know .
yes .
yes . that s right .
what happened ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
so what are you going to do now ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
really ?
why not ?
what did you do ?
i do n't know . he was feeling very well .
what did you think that ?
absolutely .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
to in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i refused it .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
i do n't think it 's going to rain today .
have you ever tried the cable ?
that means we have no idea .
really ?
i 'll let you go tomorrow .
there is a problem .
they sure did .
where are they ?
have you heard about that ?
why did you go to university ?
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
are you serious ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
you are right .
how come ?
yes i know how it is .
that 's true .
well you know that 's why i 'm not used to it . it 's just a little strange .
the information is scanty for me . and can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
you 're right .
it was a hard time .
go ahead .
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
really ? i am not so sure .
yeah how 's it going to ?
now we 've got plenty of time .
i guess i could n't believe it .
how are you these days ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
thank you . i just got back from summer camp .
yes . i also had a great time .
yes .
i 'm planning to visit new york .
is there anything else that you need to do ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
how long are you going to stay there ?
yes i am .
i see what you mean . have you found a place yet ?
where do you work ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
let 's have a look at it .
i can take care of it now .
i 'll do that .
hi bob . what can i do for you ?
i do n't think so .
no way .
you should do something .
how about you ? when are you leaving for <unk> ?
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
no .
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on . but after
i think so .
for me ?
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i 'd love to .
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i really enjoy the beach in the summer .
i have no idea .
i do n't know .
sure it 's a cell phone .
why ?
today is december <unk> two thousand and two .
you 're serious .
i was just kidding .
what do you think about it ?
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
kobe bryant of course .
do you have medical insurance ?
yes i have . i love it .
it was perfect .
who do you think about it ?
really ?
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
yes i have .
really ? how was it ?
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
really ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
are you sure he really got it ?
why ?
oh dear ! that 's really a good idea .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
what happened ?
he lost his kids college money day trading .
where was that ?
sure the best place is to reduce the price by .
yikes ! temple city .
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
really ?
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs so we are taking you into custody .
i see .
ok .

do you want to go shopping ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
yes i do .
after a while <unk> .
do you have anything to declare ?
i had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch .
what 's the problem ?
what 's wrong with it ?
that would be great .
what does that mean ?
it 's ready .
i really appreciate your company .
i m going to the hospital .
when do you need it ?
are you crazy ?
let 's sing it together shall we ?
why are you crazy about it ?
why is that ?
really ? i have no idea about that .
sure . i think filet steak will be a good choice . it 's actually the best local food .
thank you .
of course . do you want to use it ?
where can you buy it ?
yes i like collecting things .
i like playing computer games .
i prefer to stay at home and have a good time .
what 's wrong with them ?
well mom i 'm not used to watch games .
then how do you know ?
actually it 's time for me to make big progress .
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
let 's bet she 's all in love with peter .
well then .
yes maybe .
i hope so .
yes please .
that 's interesting .
no for the winter .
what does it say ?
it 's hard to say . anyway i have a lot of things to do .
it 's true .
what 's the difference ?
sounds good to me .
she 's a pleasure .
he 's going to .
really ? tell me !
of course not !
can you do it ?
that was a pleasure .
no you did n't .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
how do you use it ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to your mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
really ? come on !
i know but we have no choice .
why did you ask for leave ?
yes . i spent hours on the weekend .
i 'm afraid you ca n't . are you sure you 're finished ?
you 're right but what should i do ?
that 's all right .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
well do n't worry .
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include <unk> that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
but i 'm really busy .
she 's pretty serious about it .
not much .
i really did n't know that . when are you leaving ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
really ? why is that ?
i think you can use this job .
good luck .
there is nothing really special about it .
that 's great ! i 've never heard of it .
really ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
that 's convenient and easy to pay for it .
that 's true . but can you tell me the exact problem .
yes it 's a good idea to go .
it 's a great idea . i love swimming .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
i 'm in front of the train station .
when did you say ?
what is the next meeting ?
ok . bye !
i had enough money to afford that .
and what would you like to do ?
well whatever you say .
are you serious ?
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
o . k .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
your name please ?
nice to meet you too mr . zhang .
yes . is it easy to get around ?
what really ?
thank you . i 'll do that .
a korean film called friends starring sang <unk> .
really ? i tell you about it .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
you said this was the right stop .
i ca n't believe it .
i guess it could happen .
i understand .
goodbye . i 'm glad to hear that .
me too .
thank you for your advice .
it s not only my fault .
what time ?
when ?
yes sunday sounds fine . what time ?
doing what ?
sure .
sure . um . . . i m free on tuesday night .
that 's all right .
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
i believe so .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
all right . at what time ?
really ? i love that .
fine . what time ?
really ?
ok . i 'll take them .
ok .
sure that 's fine .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
great ! thank you so much .
well i am very sorry to hear that .
you are right .
and it 's huge .
me too . how about this one ?
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
what time shall we go ?
take good care !
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
really ?
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how far is it ?
yes he is .
oh my god ! it was scary !
sure .
not yet .
yeah .
thanks .
it s so exciting .
i just got back from bali .
how could that be ?
yes they are . i think swimming is a good idea .
how did that happen ?
that 's a good idea .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
really ? i think so too .
he is in his late thirties .
sounds like a good idea . come on !
i like that too .
okay so this weekend is the best season for me .
that 's a good idea .
yes you are right .
that 's what you mean .
yeah they are .
of course i will .
why is that ?
sports .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
you are right .
i like playing chess .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes why not ?
come on ! we can play together .
that 's fine .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like playing chess .
that 's a good idea .
i like classical music . do you ?
how about samba ?
i think playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game i ca n't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
maybe i 'm black .
of course i think so .
i like playing basketball .
you are beautiful .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet you will call him . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you mary .
ok .
where ?
that 's true . she is so pretty .
let me tell you the story . in patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
well it 's hard to say . thanks .
thanks . i am serious .
i 'm not sure . what 's the matter ?
i do n't need to sign just now .
what is wrong with that ?
not really .
do you know what you mean ?
well i do n't have much money to watch it .
i 'm going to the hospital .
yeah it 's really nice of you .
all right . there are plenty of people here .
why not ?
are you serious ?
oh i thought she was a teacher .
i know what you mean . these are beautiful .
i think i like it very much .
yeah i am . how about you ?
not much . i 'm just trying to hook up to the internet . i 'm having a few problems though .
i 'm sure you 'll look grand when it 's done .
is this your first time to go ?
that 's right .
i guess i could talk to you about it .
ok go right ahead .
ok !
let 's hurry !
they 're just broke up .
let me take a look at that .
not at all .
i do n't want to be much longer than you do .
that 's right .
i feel the same way .
really ?
i will be there right away .
what do you think about it ?
no what ?
he 's got a promotion .
that 's too bad .
he lost his kids college money day trading .
did he tell you about it ?
yeah .
we ca n't put up with it any more .
that 's all right .
we wo n't keep that in mind .
yeah . he was excellent at school !
how do you know that ?
because i have no idea .
some time .
did he see his face ?
really ?
it s all right though . just get off at the next stop and catch the a .
what happened to him ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
then he is really lucky .
i appreciate it .
come on ! what 's wrong with him ?
oh yeah ? whatever . . .
then what did you do ?
not bad . just fine and you ?
where are you going ?
i am not married yet and i live alone now .
your daughter might be able to help you .
yeah we 're ready to get married soon .
yes that sounds like fun .
yes we do .
wow you 're right .
no .
you did ?
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
oh what a shame !
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
do n't worry about that .
it s all right though . just get off at the next stop and catch the a .
yes i called the police as soon as possible .
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
really ?
i am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
where did you go to university ?
you too .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
how dreadful !
that 's enough . have you got all of them yet ?
no . i 'm serious .
my name is zhang lin .
i know with them too .
why ?
it 's half past seven .
what 's it ?
no . i 've been thinking about it before .
well .
i do n't know anything about it .
anything else ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
you do n't have to pay duty on it ?
yes please .
oh yes . how about this one ?
see you .
what 's the brand ?
what about the chicken breasts ?
i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .
really ? are you serious ?
yes .
there are so many things you want to do .
<unk> . tourists .
okay . but we could try it later .
no .
that 's a good idea .
you re in america now my british friend . we just call it football .
oh right . so i can t quite follow what s going on . . . who s winning ?
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the <unk> have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s <unk> just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .
what position do you play ?
i m a defender . it s a lot of fun . you don t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
yeah you re a pretty big guy . i play goalie myself .
oh yeah ? which team ?
the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of foot cliff . it was very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the <unk> so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in malaysia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
not only is it affordable but it comes with all the appliances .
feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
who 's that ?
if you hear about him i think so .
no i did n't .
here you are .
well i think that i can find a new one .
hey look at it .

yes of course .
you can do it yourself .
it 's got its own library theatre swimming pool and a guest house .
thank you for your advice .
well it 's hard to say . maybe i can think about it .
sure . his wife called an ambulance and they did it at home .
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .

i do n't think so too .
indeed it does .
have n't we been these places already ?
yes you can find hundreds of animals here .
how come ?
yeah you can see the results .
are you sure ?
in america most children start primary school at the age of five .
do they have to think about that ?
oh no .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sure . as long as you are looking for food all day .
the monthly sticker is yuan .
what s wrong ?

how about it ?
ok .
why ?
well the only thing we do is that i 'm going to get married .
okay here you are .
i am not sure what you offer .
i would like to book a private room .
it is wonderful . but i 'm afraid i can t do that .
that 's a good idea . anything else ?
i knew there was a breakin .
thank you for telling me that .
and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
that s the case .
yes . why ?
well i came to know a girl weeks ago and we have so much in common .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? ahhuh someone has a crush on jenny does n't he ?
yes . he is much better than what he does .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
you 're right . she 's so nice .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
thank you lisa .
cheers .
you 're welcome . i hope you 'll have a good trip .
the worst thing is that the air is taken .
and who 's the song ?
it 's white .
what 's your favorite kind of girl ?
they 're so beautiful .
thank you very much .
ok . let 's go !
it is the afternoon .
thank you .
that s ok .
why not ?
what a pity !
i know what you mean .
oh i know . i always wanted to go to the cinema .
you 're right .
good idea .
thank you . it 's been a long time has n't it ?
i went to the macy 's house .
i have no idea .
great ! when is your birthday ?
are you kidding ? it ca n't be true .
i 'm bleeding too much .
yes she is .
oh .
are you sure ?
it s true .
how about some of them ?
oh i 'm sorry . . .
what was the most expensive ?
she has light brown eyes .
i do n't care about it .
right that 's my wife !
congratulations !
thanks .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
i have earned a lot of money this week more than i do in a fortnight .
what 's that ?
of course ! i am .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
well that 's too bad . how can i go there ?
i have no idea .

how about at ?
ok .
yes let 's do that .
not at all .
goodbye .
ok . i 'll do my best .
goodbye .
thank you .
excuse me miss .
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
good idea .
i 'm sure we can go to the local bookshop .
i 'll bet it 's going to rain .
here is the money .
i have no idea what you mean .
thanks ! these are beautiful . you should n't have !
thank you .
yes i have n't been registered yet .
how long have you been there ?
huh ?
thank you .
you are welcome .
i just got back from london .
i bet you had a wonderful time
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do n't let me hold you up .
no i am kidding . but i 've got back from hawaii .
come on ! do n't worry about it .
i can wash my clothes for less money here .
i m glad to hear that .
he is in his late thirties .
i missed it .
speaking .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
no . i am sure .
excellent . thank you very much .
how about this one ?
that sounds good .
so are we going to make you a lot of money ?
ok .
in that case we 'll have a taxi .
i 'd like to get a ba .
well that 's no problem . how much would you like to spend ?
i like your idea .
excuse me too .
what are they ?
great . where are we going to go ?
i agree .
wait for a moment .
yes . i am going to get married .
no i have n't . i liked it very much .
it 's a new movie .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .

i live in the haitian district .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thank you .
oh i 'm very busy . how are you ?
say i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ?
good to see you too !
i like spring .
why ?
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
i 've heard that when this happens it 's important to save energy .
ok . let 's go .
shall we go now ?
uh . . .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
what 's your name today ?
i really hate this weather .
cool fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the st april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on th may .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
what time is the fitting room ?
it 's all right .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was a hard time .
what was the score ?
you know sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
really ?
it was a forbidden city .
now we 've got plenty of time .
oh then i guess i failed .
thank you . i just got back from summer camp .
yes . i also had a great time .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
how about a game of bridge ?
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
oh my god ! i m so sorry !
i m sure she will .
yes . let 's sing it together .
when did you get them ?
ok !
really ? i ca n't believe it .
oh yeah .
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan .
jason i ca n't agree with you but i think they 're not sure .
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
all right . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
it 's really nice .
that s wonderful .
no but it 's not always hot .
what 's wrong with it ?
there are seats available for air . you can have them .
but the train is too crowded .
it 's .
well there 's a watch on tv now .
you mean halfandhalf ?
no that 's right .
i have n't decided yet .
give me a break .
no this is the first time i 've been here .
really ? have you been there ?
uh . . . i have n't decided yet .
how s that going ?
no i won t .
yeah i have n't been on a long time .
oh i am sorry to hear that . what did you do there ?
it was seven feet tall .
yes i m very glad to meet you .
fine . as long as you can eat something . we can see how much money we can eat .
no problem .
i had to look after my son at home .
i am really sorry .
i didn t know . i m sorry .
i know . thank you for calling .
what 's the matter ?
that 's too bad .
go ahead .
you are welcome .

i know .
that s not enough .
ok goodbye .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your <unk> opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
oh i see .
it is n't your fault . no one will blame you .
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped <unk> .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .

that 's good .
i 'd like to very much .
try to keep cool . it 's not an easy take .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
then you will be in line for a doom .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to the club . look at them .
yes i have . i started a couple of months ago .
oh i see . that 's why later on .
well it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
really ? i 'm surprised .
birds of a feather flock together .
i hope so .
yeah that 's true . the one thing is to see was each other .

oh yes . it seems she can never accept that .
birds of feather flock together .
yeah that 's right .

i am sorry he 's in a meeting now . could i ask who is calling ?
this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by <unk> company .
oh great ! how nice to meet you !
i 'm fine . what 's your name ?
ok let 's see .
oh what are you going to do ?
what about roses ?
me too .
you 're right !
it 's saturday am .
see you then .
good idea .
oh my poor danny sure you are a man . but you know running like this in street is very dangerous .
you should homework .
i know . but if you buy something else i ca n't figure out .
really ?
really ? that 's great !
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
then what 's your best price for her .
what ?
i love you too dad . you know it s a good game .
that s fine . is there anything i can do for you ?
what else does n't he do ?
his parents must feel very happy .
can i have a seat on it ?
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
where are you going to buy it ?
i 'm still single .
maybe you are not kidding .
are you kidding ?
what makes you think that ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
yes they are .
would you like me to go with you ?
i 'd like to but i 'm tied up with my paper .
do you want to type that letter ?
i d rather you typed it .
do you want to tell her ?
i d rather you told her .
yes i 'm going to the cinema dad .
you must n't go to bed very late . can you be home before nine .
oh i wo n't be back so early . the film will be over at nine . can i have the key to the bicycle ?
no . i wo n't let you ride a bicycle late at night .
oh dad i 'm not a child . i 'm already . i 'll come back as soon as the film is over .
ok . here 's the key . take care .
i will . thank you dad .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
it 's not my fault .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials <unk> it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
i did n't really like it .
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
i found it very disappointing .
she liked the acting too because that 's what she wanted to see .
i was n't happy with it .
nothing is to your satisfaction .
never ! he s over isn t he ?
he s nearly .
good gracious ! are you sure ?
i am . whatsmore his wife is .
is she really ?
yes she is . and guess what he is her sixth husband .
really ? quite a woman isn t she ?
of course not . he has a very good neighbour .
on the th ?
no i assure you .
and you 'll repair the television wo n't you ?
ok .
what 's the brand ?
of course .
well they don t want to deal with people who look like that . they want people who look more like yourself .
i 'll see . i will if i can but i wo n't promise .
but you 'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ?
yes . but only if you ask me nicely .
tom darling . you 'll try not to be late for dinner tonight wo n't you ? please !
ok . i 'll keep my promise .

you re kidding . it can t be true .
believe it or not . everybody is talking about it in the company .
really ? i m surprised .
me too .
i m watching tv .
anything interesting on ?
i will .
one more thing keep your desk neat . it 's the rule . there is no exception even the art designers have to keep their desks neat .
yes it looks interesting .
you 're right . i love it very much .
it must be old .
at least more than years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?
frightened ? you must be joking .
yes i do .
i m sure she won t let me down .
how do you do mr . smith ?
my name is wang liang i m from beijing . where do you come from ?
thank you .
a glass of white wine would be fine thank you .
yes please .
it s very good . thank you .
we re very happy to be with you .
me too .
hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working on thursdays . i am busy this week .
maybe you are right .
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
that s fine . i think you re going to have a better time isn t it ?
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the st of may . oh dear . arm . . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
oh that s very kind of you .
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
ok . bye .
bye .
i 'm very impressed . would you like to go with me ?
thank you .
how did you like it ?
that s a lot of money .
yes . it s nice to meet you .
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what was your salary at the bank ?
i got a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i m a doctor .
thank you for coming ms . baker .
what s the problem ?
may i know what you do ?
yes let 's go have a look .
yes .
where do you want to go ?
that s all right . i can understand .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
thank you for your hospitality .
tomorrow ?
that s a pity . we can arrange another time hopefully .
tomorrow afternoon would be ok .
you re welcome . have a good time .
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is <unk> chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
have you ever been so far ?
and she 's good at sports too . she knows how to play tennis and basketball .
what s next ?
i see .
there 's nothing i can do .
great . thanks a lot .
really ? are you serious ?
alright . calm down .
that 's right . i 've lived in america for two years .
i ca n't figure out what to pay for it . let 's go home .
i know what you mean .
yes i think i could . what else is this going to be ?
that 's not a problem . i 'll go and see what i can do .
sounds interesting to me .
thank you so much .
well what 's the matter ?
take it easy . you can talk to her and understand her .
really ? are you serious ?
i get along pretty well with you . i feel terrible .
but life is n't fair .
well this office is over .
what 's wrong with it ?
no . just relax .
why ?
well i 'm really busy these days .
coming .
that 's great ! when will it be ?
that 's all right .
of course . but i 'm sure you 'll love it .
i see .
that 's okay .
thanks .
that 's right .
i really like that .
that s true !
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i have n't eaten anything all day .
so what are you going to do ?
sounds like fun .
yes it 's going to be fun .
is there a problem ?
i 'm afraid that i 'm very ill .
you know what ?
it s very kind of you .
it 's .
fine .
well i don t think so .
yeah i know . thanks .
who s this ?
really ? thank you .
okay . i ll pick you up around
thank you mr . johnson . you ve made a guaranteed reservation at the guangzhou xx hotel from april th to th for nights . if you can t arrive as schedule please inform us before p . m . on april . hank you for calling and we look forward to serving you
the pleasure is all mine .
you ve got a good idea ! what is it ?
absolutely .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
have you ever heard about the internet ?
it 's important to tell him .
no i have n't . i 'm interested in it .
it 's a sony made in japan .
it 's really worth it .
yeah . you 're right .
what are you going to do about that ?
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
well china is really a clever way to save money .
it 's very good .
it 's true . i 've heard all about it .
anything else ?
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
what is the price ?
yeah . i 'll be back then .
how did the party go ?
it 's just that i 'm right .
you need to keep it at .
well wait for a moment please .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
really ?
nice to meet you too .
well my mum s birthday present .
i don t know . i think you re ready to buy the house .
sure come on in . it s nothing .
well . . . and it s not going to be so fun !
it s easy . i can always remember how to use a camera .
really ? tell me about it .
so are we .
it 's a brandnew seiko wrist watch .
but i would n't say that .
but they are really nice .
never mind i 'll get that .
yes it 's furnished .
what room ?
is there anything else i should do for you ?
maybe .
have you got it ?
when will you give me a raise ?
do you really think so ?
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
i do n't like the food .
well why did n't you ask me to do something for help ?
you said it .
really ?
have you ever tried then ?
what am i supposed to have to do now ?
sorry but i can t .
i see . what can i do for you ?
i feel like having a sandwich .
what about the one down the street ?
perfect !
i like chinese food . i think i 'll try it .
the son will be happy to help you .
really ?
what is it ?
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
hey i play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . it 's great exercise and it 's fun too .
it is .
we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china .
we hope that we can get together as soon as you can promise .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
that s a good idea . thanks for that .
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
the service charge is ten cents a copy .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
maybe i am right .
yes i like collecting things .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .

oh that 's really a bad girl .
gunpowder compass the paper making and the printing .
pretty good .
what 's the holiday ?
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that 's a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
thank you for the invitation .
that 's a good idea . i m sure you can do them well .
i am a grownup .
. . . good idea !
oh it was terrific ! i never know how to play games .
perhaps you could use a computer program now .
exactly .
because i loved it too .
yeah i don t know .
you 're right ! you 're right .
i 'm not sure yet . what do you think ?
bye .
to tell you the truth i did n't know but it 's too late .
yes i know where it is .
i want to study english literature . but i am not sure about it .
leave me alone !
you 're such a good teacher .
no problem . can you tell me about it ?
yes i know . but i have to work it .
it 's called the lantern festival .
what 's wrong with it ?
they do n't mind .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
thank you .
oh i see .
fine . let 's check it out .
i only want it to cool down .
there are different kinds of chinese zodiac .
how do you feel about it ?
oh tell me how to take a break .
i don t know anything about them .
yes i see . thanks .
what happened ?
that 's good idea .
that 's expensive .
here it is .
are you sure ?
good idea .
how about photography ?
you 'll see .
if you do n't mind me asking how to use it .
i think so .
well as you know i did it a lot .
thank you .
well i have got you three first class tickets and i have reserved your seats . your seat numbers are a b and c .
yeah that s true .
i ca n't say that .
if you do n't like the food there 's a good job on the market .
i wish i could .
if you like a good job we should do something to help us .
yes . i think they are very animals .
that s right .
quite sure .
yes it is . you can find a good one .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
what are they ?
not really .
that 's great ! i ca n't believe it .
yes . i was wondering if you could give me a raise .
that 's true .
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
that 's a good idea . how long have you been looking for it ?
yes . have you ever been there before ?
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
that 'll be rmb please .
what 's the problem ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
hey ! that 's not a bad habit !
oh it 's really a good film .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
what 's your favorite movie ?
oh yeah .
good .
bill and betty have already grown up .
oh mom .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
oh i know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then .
you are kidding .
but you agreed to go out with me at last .
smile i can t believe this for it s been years since we got married .
what about that one ?
really ? mm !
why not ?
what s it about ?
oh well it sounds like a lot of fun .
what other kind of food do you like ?
yeah . i m really excited about it .
good for you . shall we make it tomorrow ?
that 's true .
the <unk> bride is going to be on the rocks .
sure . whatever you say .
well what time ?
there 's a watch right now .
okay .
it was a good food was n't it ?
but she s not a fine girl .
i see .
really ? that 's wonderful .
it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
how is it ?
they 're all good .
certainly .
i like it very much .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that scans all <unk> so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of spamunwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star s private live in recent years .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
<unk> really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
i think you re right about that . i d need a good manager to be my <unk> . i could do a lot of charity work which would help a lot of people .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks but actually i m hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about or places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an <unk> program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several <unk> the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i don t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro
so if the cause is poverty there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
you re right . there is too much to do . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but i hate being so far away from the city centre .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
it 's true .
thank you .
and i don t know how to go .
are there any difference ?
mm that you can change your job stress at the moment .
delighted .
they are subject to hard training . and you know what for a player on the national team personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .

why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his <unk> ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language too .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
could i have one more blanket ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
do n't mention it .
what makes you think that ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
yes they are .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
they wear the same clothes they re all blond they all drive cars they all own parker fountain pens they all drink coca cola and they all chew gum .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart .
thank you mr . black .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . can i get you another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
ok . how about give me a ring then ?
no . i d better not .
why not ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will <unk>
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o
well i think you re pretty lucky actually . you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be <unk> grateful . i bet you it will even <unk> mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here sa beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy put that down right now ! it could sting you !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
ok i ll take care of the children .
what are you doing ?
why not ?
she is chinese .
what ? i think you can t just expect me to make sure ?
yes . four hundred and fifty .
count me in .
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
if you give him an idea ?
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
yes . i know !
what s the problem ?
oh so what s the problem ?
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
well you know what ?
okay i ll take it easy .
i m very sorry to hear that .
what 's that ?
that doesn t matter !
yeah this is a very good idea .

i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
then walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
wow ! it s just your fault !
it s right . i ve got a really bad headache .
well this is my first time you know .
what about things ?
well that s the point . it s just what you have to say .

i may just get some chips .
i 'm afraid not now but i 'm too busy .
well what time do you want to meet ?
you said it .
what will you do on saturday ?
no i 'm going to the movies .
i do n't like this .
why do n't you stay with us ?
yes i find jogging does good to me so i keep on doing it .
you 've formed a sound habit .
i think so too .
yes it is really great .
unfortunately not .
people believe that there are only reasonable .
that 's great !
o clock . ok .
that 's right .
well it sure is . i could n't agree with you about that . they 're a horrible movie .
no what did you want to see ?
that s a bad idea . you could take a picture there .
that 's out of luck !
yes you are right .
no problem . i am glad you like it .
that 's a good idea !
that 's a good idea .
star war .

oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
good idea . let s meet again in the park .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
well what are you going to do about it ?
catch the and get off at sons .
as you know we re planning to climb a cliff on the yangtze river .
do n't worry .
i went swimming .
how do you feel about it ?
i like playing basketball .
i just like watching tv .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
i used to exercise every day .
that 's a good idea . you should exercise more time .
yes .
what do you mean ?
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
is there anything wrong with it ?
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
yeah .
that s right .
if that 's exactly what you are going to do .
i feel that it s me .
i do n't think so .
yeah i know .
thanks . i don t feel that way . how often do you exercise each day ?
are you good at school ?
do you still play table tennis ?
oh so we should be more careful next time .
absolutely not . but we should learn more about it .
yes . i ve got an idea of it .
that 's a good idea .
nothing really .
of course . i know a lot about chinese food . but it 's a different experience .
thanks .
they 're probably available .
oh come on .
why do n't you stay at home and have a good rest .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
what do you mean ?
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a stranger here .
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like avoiding <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no . how did he know ?
have you ever heard about that ?
no they had no reason for arresting me .
yeah me too . what are you going to do now ?
what 's the matter with my job ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous .
yes he is .
nobody told me .
well you must be kidding .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
great . . .
go ahead .
where if you want to go ?
your usual shirt and shoes .
it 's gorgeous !
will i know what you mean ?
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color i 'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?
it 's ok .
so what were you calling me about ?
do n't mention it .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
sure .
ok . see you later .
you bet .
ok .
well i guess not to drink too much .
i have thought about it .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
got it . see you later .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
you 've got it . bye .
i had my first cigarette when i was .
yes i love them . you know next week ?
take the next right . drive about one click further and you ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall .
i tried her personality .
supervisor . open the door .
oh it 's alright .
it would n't be true .
all right .
what are you going to do now ?
good idea .
i feel like having some dumplings .
i do n't know .
sounds good . let me have a look .
oh that 's great !
yes it is .
how much do you want ?
no ?
no he won t .
i do n't really know .
really ?
that 's a good idea .
i am getting dressed .
let s have a look .
what application materials should i wear ?
oh i forgot about it . i 'll get it .
i think i should just make dinner special .
i thought you had trouble with clive !
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
that 's fine .
maybe i should think about it .
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
china .
what was the score ?
the ukraine team took the lead by to at the end of the first half .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not so well . i 've come down with the flu .
i 'm going back to visit my sister in beijing .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
oh i see . by the way what should i do now ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
two blocks down the street .
when will the classes start ?
no you do n't have to .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at please .
ok great should i bring anything ?
a party of .
alright we are waiting for you at .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no please feel free .
oh is it ? thank you anyway .
you 're welcome .
thanks a lot . i m sure he ll be .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
i hope so .
i hope you have a good trip .
ok . i 'll see you then .
that is the best thing i can do .
well what s up ?
why ?
it does n't matter .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby .
go right ahead .
i like what i see .
wow you really do have a talent for this alice .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did .
are you sure ?
no i did n't . it was scary .
of course they are .
hi jenny ! jason here . it 's great to hear your voice again .
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
you 're right but you know it 's hard to give up an old habit .
so what is the problem ?
i have got it .
you 're right .
is it because of the bad weather ? it 's been really miserable for the past tew days .
what do you think i should do ?
the extensions are for sure that might be a little confusing . . .
sure . here you are .
i hope so .
how about the food ?
that s right . but i m not talking about it at all .
i stayed up last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
of course could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
i had a sore throat too .
okay .
i do n't think so .
i know what you mean .
i was there for about three years .
why ?
the company is doing great job .
well mark . if you are hungry you have to go to the dentist .
no . i thought it would be .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
it sure does .
good idea .
yeah . it won t be much but at least we ll have a monthly check when we get old .
i was looking forward to that .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? no they are .
that was an odd change of subject .
ok . anything else ?
because i saw forrest gump the other day .
of course not . go ahead .
are you sure that it is n't somewhere in your room ?
laura .
do you like this place ?
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
i love it . i ve had a lot of work .
sure . i think that 's what i 'm doing .
yes that 's right .
that 's great . then you have to really enjoyed your stay .

that 's not a good idea . it must have been really interesting .
we re looking forward to seeing someone .

peas and carrots .

orange juice please .
would you like anything to drink ?
peas and carrots .

you 'll see this charge on your amenities account .
of course .

the open house is in the basement .
great how are you ?
goodbye randy . take care .
wait a minute .
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
thank you .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i am going to visit my brother .
why not ?
to the beach
hop in please .
medicine .
i do n't know .
when is it ?
am . what 's the fare please ?
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
maybe you are right .
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
have you ever been there ?
i am impressed by your resume .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i thought about it would be nice to meet you too .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
hey look outside ! it 's started to drizzle !
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
not really . what s up ?
what are you doing ?
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
how old is he today ?
it 's his th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like current affairs programs and documentaries especially wildlife ones . how about you ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
in my country there s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
yeah you re right . let s talk to him next week .
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . you ve made recently .
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you have anything to declare ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious .
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from germany .
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
what kind of exercise is it ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
great . thanks for asking .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
usually the government should show that it is using money efficiently .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
pretty good .
sure .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
. yuan .
it 's ok . bye .
i know that . to make up my mind .
oh no . i ca n't afford that .
i 'm afraid you ca n't .
three thousand dollars per night .
really ? i do n't want to pay for it .
they believe it or not .
are you serious ? how about yours ?
it would n't have some money to save money .
every year we have to do it .
really ? that 's a surprise .
well now you have to drive yourself . what is it ?
what did you do ?
you are welcome .
yes . we can make reservations .
why ?
the rent is each month .
that 's too expensive . can you make it cheaper ?
what about roses ?
well i know . it 's very expensive .
i agree .
have you had anything to eat ?
i 'm not sure yet .
do you have a lot of options ?
yes i have .
it sure is .
no i can t .
i do n't know how to say it in english .
oh i see . thank you very much .
it was okay .
i have to take care of it . what do you think about it ?
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh you mean the one ?
the one smoking a cigar .
yeah .
why do n't you say that ? he is in prison .
does it suit me ?
what 's the time ?
why ?
he 's so handsome is n't he ?
well what are you talking about ?
why ?
come on . what are you thinking about ?
promise me !
i really do n't know .
what do you think about it ?
if i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up !
yes . i was a failure .
i see . but i have to think about it .
ok . i will think about it .
why do n't you think about it ?
where can we go ?
goodbye randy . take care .
well what do you think about this one ? i have to think about it .
that 's all right .
no i do n't . i am really tired !
do n't you have any hobbies like you ?
don t worry . you ll have to get it for you .
i 'll have them made for you .
oh it 's nothing .
i have no idea about it .
that 's true .
thank you for saying that .
no . i 'm not interested in that . do you like me ?
well the sale price is each .
i think it 's a way to go .
yes i know .
that 's great .
i 'll ask you why ?
it doesn t matter how old you are .
yuan .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
i don t think so .
ok . i 'll give it to the doctor .
i know what you want to say .
that 's okay .
do n't worry about it .
well if you want to go to a concert .
hmm . that s good . i have to think about it .
no !
oh . . . i cannot forget that .
hi rock sam ! how are you ?
actually i only need a letter of recommendation .
yeah some guys are going to have to work out as soon as they can .
they look delicious .
what s the problem ?
well tell me about my work .
basically what about the boss ?
you are one of the most boss .
i see .
it was good to see you again .
pretty good .
i was hoping you would come .
there are four people in my family .
how old is your brother ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
you bet .
that 's true . what did your brother say ?
for many people like that !
are you sure he s a little older ?
that 's a lot of fun .
i ca n't believe it . where did he go ?
thank you .
please sit down .
how do you think we have them ?
if you like this place you can make a decision .
well i see .
you bet . she 's a psycho .
do you know what she 's got ?
ok then .
watch your hand .
goodbye .
sure !
thanks a lot .
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .
just a minute please .
i 'm most grateful .
yes here it is .
what kind of information do you want ?
i 'm usually online shopping .
that 's a good idea .
it 's very nice of you .
that 's no problem .
i am a big fan of snoop dog .
sounds cool !
why ?
that 's true . what do you think i should do ?
i 'm o 'clock . i know what to help you .
where do you want to go ?
i feel so tired .
i wonder what happened .
it is a job at an advertisement company .
of course .
there is no parking sign .
right we 'll go into it this afternoon and how long will you meet the needs of us ?
well would you give me a receipt ?
i am glad to hear that you are enjoying your beautiful scenery .
you 're welcome .
i like playing chess .
yeah .
there 's an emergency room right now .
i like pizza .
hmm . i m not sure .
oh you do n't think so .
yeah . they 're right . like what do you think ?
where did you learn it ?
usually i go to bed twice a week .
you 're right .
yes . what about you ?
let me know where you live .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
thank you . i 'd like to see them .
ok please .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all genres except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of <unk> friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and bawling whole <unk> of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends .
i got you . next time . i 'll preface a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where is it ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a kissass . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hiphop or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yes it 's not like what the radio said at all .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
i know it 's about degrees centigrade .
yes . it 's really snowing .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
you said it .
me too !
i thought you knew .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too .
oh where are you from ?
i m there .
how long will it take by airmail ?
really ? have you tried it ?
i knew it was the stop .
is there a fire ?
he got a scolding .
that 's right .
of course i did .
oh really ? congratulations !
that 's right .
it was a good game was n't it ?
who ?
so what ?
i do n't know what to say .
what 's wrong ?
that 's right .
do you think that 's good ?
he has light brown eyes .
he s fine .
maybe . i had it stolen a few days ago .
oh yes you 're right .
why not ?
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
you 're right . i 'll give it a try .
at least you are going to be ok .
oh street .
i think you should save more money .
i am sorry to hear that . you should know everything is going to be taken care of .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space shuttles are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet humankind will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
that is too much .
perfect . but i m not sure he works very well .
me too !
what happened ?
yeah ?
thanks doctor .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for .
would you take ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for . how about ?
. ?
sorry is the lowest i can go .
i know what you mean .
then would you like something to drink ?
it s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . nobody sticks around in the summer .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate .
oh great ! that 's at the other end of the terminal !
thank you very much .
am i right behind you ?
i m a podiatrist . what about you ?
what kind of camera would you like ?
it s a very cool job .
me too .
i work at the polling place .
yes . here you are .
what is the price for this one ?
anything else ?
bye !
a young boy .
what makes you say that ?
because you can see the stars perfectly .
really ? how can they live with you ?
i 'd say it 's hard for me .
i hope so .
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he s bleeding .
i see . well dogs are more independent .
i was there for almost two years .
that 's true .
i have it right now .
why did n't you ask that ?
i hope so .
why not ?
i have been married for three years .
here is the money .
i 'm not sure he 'll be back until the day .
i m so happy that .
there are four people in my family .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we 're identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete <unk> when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
he died when i was just a baby .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
i sure did n't .
what a shame !
all right i got it .
it 's full .
he has no idea .
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
what happened ?
he is tall and slim .
you 're right . it 's unbelievable !
he had a mask on his face .
why do n't you say that again ?
he 's fixing his roof .
i was born in beijing but i spent most of my childhood in london .
what was your childhood like ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
it is me . i know what you mean . do n't they ?
no i 'll get along very well .
true .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
what university did you have ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
that s a great idea .
no . but i only did n't .
really ?
i learned english for the first two years .
you mean you ca n't be serious ?
i 'm going to read a book tomorrow .
got it .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
i do n't know what to say .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
don t you think you would miss having other people around ?
no way ! i do n't think we are boring .
it was one of the most famous people in my life . i guess both of them would be ok .
that 's true . some of the time i m glad that even though i don t want any children i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand i can t imagine what china would be like if there weren t a onechild policy !
you 'd better leave them more .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
you 're right . otherwise i would n't have the satisfaction .
thank you for helping me .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let 's see . . .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
that 's it ! that s the one i was thinking of !
you really have a big head do n't you .
i am not sure but probably about years .
about i think . when are you born ?
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
i guess we have to keep it as long as possible .
he 's been out of work for a couple of days .
how do you think it will be a good idea to have a child ?
i had mine when i was . that s a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i am thinking about having a child but not just yet .
well there 's a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you see them . i think most parents want their children to be like them .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
you re right . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i am not sure . i guess i have to be a terrible team player .
what a pity !
but you are right .
so i doubt it is my fault . if you aren t there anything i should do to get rid of it .
no problem .
that 's right .
well i had no idea about it .
that 's true .
all you see .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
yeah it s going to be a blast !
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it s a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and <unk> them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
so you have to find out your own store .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
are you kidding me ?
that 's great ! it would be great to see you again .
you too .
fine thank you . how are you doing this morning ?

excellent ! our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . let me show you some options . this is our most popular choice our river guides will take you
i don t really think i m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . what else do you have ?
well in that case we can take you hang <unk> with one of our experienced instructors . it s the closest you can get to flying .
what ? you mean <unk> myself to a flimsy kite ? no thank you ! next !
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge .
i m thinking something exciting but safer .
i have the perfect option this package will take you on a hiking trip through the himalayas for three days and afterwards there s a dog sledding journey !
that s more like it !
all right .
okay susan . it says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . is this information correct ?

ok i see .
thanks . i am starving . tom what are you getting ?
no .
how long do you have ?
no i do n't have anything to declare .
it 's not what i had .
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what time is the hotel ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
sounds like this ?
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful <unk> for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip .
just a moment please . i do n't know .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
that s great .
no problem .
yes i did . there is one problem .
and what about the kitchen ?
no they do n't .
why not ?
it s broken .
yeah that s it . i d like to make it .
yes i have two lots of help .
do you like the internet ?
that was wonderful !
please come in .
that 's all right .
where can i get the food from ?
ok .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
who s this ?
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
no i have n't decided yet .
really ? that s wonderful . congratulations !
don t worry . i ll take it .
is there anything else you need to do ?
they 're most advanced machines .
when are you leaving ?
there are some similarities that come up with their work .
i had no idea .
they are peppermint chocolates .
hi . i 'd like to book a single room with a bath .
how many people ?
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
i m not sure .
that s all right .
that 's very reasonable .
that 's great to hear . where are you going ?
good for you .
of course . it 's .
yes here you go .
i 'd like to have some local specialties . would you recommend for me please ?
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
it 's not too late .
i hope so .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm planning to visit new york .
is there anything else that you need to do ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
are you going to the airport and your name please ?
yes i am .
i guess that s a great apartment . how much rent is it ?
i d rather have to stay home .
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
let 's have a look at it .
i can also get back together .
he s all right .
let me check sir . according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
well the wrong information is in my file .
well it was fun .
thank you .
the reason is there anything else i can do for you today ?
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you can use it .
oh is not that your help .
i know . i should have been told about this .
sure . i 'll have to meet you on friday night .
it 's a bit expensive .
i think one hundred dollars will be enough .
she s pretty good then . what about her ?
oh that sounds great . i ca n't wait to have a try .
why not ? what a good idea .
perfect ! i like that !
sure . you 're all right .
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
please .
you 're right . by the way is there anything else i can do for you ?
ok . you just want to get a hamburger .
i want to go to the cinema .
i like that ! could you please call to see if we can go to a restaurant ?
sure when ?
what would you like ?
steak please .
unfortunately we 're out of filet mignon at the moment . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
and may i suggest chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
normally i would take you up on that suggestion but just the champagne will do for tonight .
then you are welcome .
that 's fine .
all right .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you what 's going on .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port . unfortunately my laptop uses wireless only .
okay . there 's no alternatives .
yes i 'd love to hear what the alternatives are .

great ! how much does that cost ?
it 's two hundred yuan .

well first i was wondering if you want to join me ?
i 'm sorry . we 're not out of filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
perhaps i could interest you in chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne ?
thank you but i just finished eating some chocolatecovered cherries .
if you do n't mind let me know .
i do n't know what the problem is .
i ll take this one .
do you want to have anything to drink ?
well . let me check it .
i hate to tell you this but we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .

thank you but i just finished eating some chocolatecovered cherries .
just calm down . i 'll have to walk now .

well i have n't been eating well i guess . i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
and what about dinner ?
sometimes i 'm too tired to eat anything at all .
that 's not good . you do n't have a wellbalanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
i do n't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .

you 'll think about it .
may i see your id please sir ?
one second please while i dig it out . here .
then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ?

i 'm sorry mr . sandals but we accept only mastercard or visa .
i ll put it on my visa card then .
thank you .
yes that 's just what i wanted .
are you okay with me ?
thank you .
it should be enough .

please wait a minute . it 'll be ready .
thank you .
certainly sir .
really ?
most people have no side effects .
yes . i know .
you will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
make sure you drink a lot of water when you drink plenty of water .
i can see that .
i 'll be right back .
there is no problem with my bill .
thank you .
you will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough .
i can t do that .
just a minute please . here you are .
i ve got it .
you may have a little bit of a dry cough but you will feel much better .
sure what 's on the computer ?
i had a headache this morning . i didn t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very <unk> . maybe it is the migrated .
the best product is techne and you can get either the lotion or cream .
which one is best ?
i 'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber .
that 's right .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate your help .
do n't mention it .
what kind of prescription do you want ?
what 's that ?
there is no problem at all .
when ?
there is no side effects .
that 's great .
no you 'll be ok .
oh thanks a lot .
most people have no side effects .
great . i 've been looking for a place to live recently .
have you had any type of bug lately ?
it has been horrible last night .
i don t know what to tell you .
yes i have been getting some cereal .
what did you say ?
i usually go to aerobics in the morning .
does it bother you when you eat something ?
no . it does n't work .
i know where to find one .
do you think i could help me with my resume ?
how long have you had it ?
i see .
not as much as i can .
well nobody 's agree with you .
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me .
when did you get that ?
i ve been getting really short of breath and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
what s the matter ?
i ve been having enough time to get up .
how come ?
yes i have .
sure . would you like some soup ?
no i don t have enough for me .
what 's wrong with that ?
yes it definitely bothers me more when i do it .
i will need to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown leaving the opening in the back .
what should i do after that ?
some of my friends tell me that being a teacher the most important is the beauty of mind . you should n't pay too much attention to your appearance . you should appear frugal and prudent . your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer .
should i do anything else ?
sure . take it easy .
is that ok ?
yes . thank you .
what about you ?
we are going to visit my sister in the city .
what should i do ?
that 's it .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t eat anything and look my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .
well let s have a look . open wide . hmm . . . this doesn t look good . well it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i m going to order some xrays .
is it gonna hurt ?
no not at all ! just lay back and relax .
where do i go ?
yes the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . and the pain comes more intense when i walk too much .
have you ever had any trauma ?
yes i have .
now let me have a look at you . i d like to listen to your chest . breathe then deep breath that s it . cough now again . i want to exam your throat too . open wide say a .
yes it does . just like a needle prick . besides the place that hurts often feels cold too .
do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
yes i have .
do you usually travel by bus ?
by the way does acupuncture hurt ?
acupuncture may cause just a little pain but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we ll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
yes .
that 's good to hear . you 've had an ideal recovery from your operation . we 're going to have to send you home tomorrow .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
do n't be in such a hurry . i 'm confident that you 'll be completely recovered in to weeks .
is there anything i should do ?
you 'd better have a good rest for a week . be sure to have regular meals . stay away from alcohol . give up smoking at least a little while .
should i take some medicine ?
yes . i 'm going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one two tablets . and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks please .
yes it 's very kind of you .
you 're welcome . we wish you a speedy recovery . goodbye .
let me see . roll up your sleeve please . um . . . it 's swollen and red here . i 'm afraid we 'll need to take an xray to see if it 's broken .
what if it 's broken ?
then we 'll put you in a cast .
yes . see you later .
that 's right .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can t even make out something ten meters away .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this and when i point please read the chart from the top and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
all right .
how about some fish ?
well this one is worse .
never mind just read as far as you can .
i can only read the first three lines .

we done a lot of things this year .
that 's great .
thank you .
then they are blind with me .

i have no idea .
account . . .
do you have to pay for this charge ?
yes sir .
i guess you 're right .
i see .
that s right .
wow ! this is just what is the size of historical interest in my country .
it 's correct .
definitely .
five hundred and fifty yuan .
you should say that again .
that 's true .
she is dealing with customers and driving up new business .
why did you say that ?
ok . i feel the same way .
you are right .
what was the problem ?
i would like you to send it by airmail .
yuan please .
i 'm just going to let you know .
i only want to transfer .
thank you very much .
it 's ok .
from to o 'clock .
great . let 's go .
yes i do .
well i was just wondering if you could ask me .
so what are you talking about ?
i m a keyboard operator . what s your job ?
have you ever had so much contact with this company ?
she would say i have n't received the scholarship yet .
really ?
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done .
yes i can understand that .
they would say i am a dependable and hard worker .
she 's a team player .
i understand .
do you have any particular title in your company ?
no i did n't .
ok how 's your married life ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
maybe that 's what you want to do .
i have no idea . i don t mind working with them .
what are your salary expectations ?
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
do you think a company is a good idea ?
i will think about it .
i see . what about your intention ?
that 's true . i can work overtime if it 's necessary but i don t work well .
how about your company ?
it is said that the most important thing is the nature of the company .
do you leave your last position ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
ok it 's fine with me .
well doctor i think i should have a few respect for him .
what 's the problem ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
i have just left school but i am well acquainted with office work .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the <unk> mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
of course i 'm sure you are .
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's very good .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
where shall we go ?
why are you so calm ?
well ok . i will try it later .
what ? i am sure i can do well .
because i m not a fireman and it is dangerous for me .
you 're right . i need a lot of help .
yes i am happy to hear that !
why do you choose our company ?
i will good luck .
yes speaking .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?
oh i 'm sorry but i 'd rather stay at home .
there is something wrong with your credit card .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
yes and i check all the emails for mr . thomas .
oh that 's very kind of you .
i 'll be here to pick you up at .
ok . i 'll wait for you .
it 's nice . well i hope you have a good time .
goodbye .
yes it 's thursday .
i 'm sorry but of these notes seem to be counterfeit . look at this watermark do you see it ?
it 's october the st our national day . i 'd like to talk some more but i 've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you though .
th sep ? oh i have an appointment tonight .
is that right ?
how about tomorrow night ?
it 's p . m .
what time is it ?
you wo n't be late . it 's still early .
really ?
yes ?
so i got it . thank you very much for saying so .
no really .
i love it . how about you ?
so you are very happy .
let me see . well you 're right .
good morning mr . li
it 's already o 'clock .
well how much is it ?
it 's still early today .
i 'm afraid not . i was too late .
karaoke has become a major entertainment . i wonder why .
it s not my fault . i can t believe it .
again ?
i 'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
all right .
that makes sense .
that 's great .
i do n't have enough time to buy something .
it 's a place near the convention center .
where is that ?
ok but you must stay calm . do you want me to give you a lift ?
may i have a glass of red wine please ?
okay .
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes <unk> and fruits .
maybe you 're right .
. let me see . . . nope .
that 's not bad .
not yet .
that 's ok .
why not ?
i see .
yes we have an appointment right now . why ?
fine . i 'll do that .
he 's in charge of the meeting .
how much does it cost ?
ok .
you said that you want to learn english and learn english .
fine boy .
yes please .
let me see .
i 'm glad i want to meet you too .
we 'd like it .
thank you . i am sure i will .
how much is the cost ?
we are not sure about that in my country .
that 's right . how about the european market ?
he has nothing to worry about .
soup always makes me feel better when i 'm sick . i hope it makes you feel better too .
the commission is three percent .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a commission will not leave us much .
that 's amazing !
i 'm afraid that we 'll have to reduce our price .
yes that s the one .
usually the commission is three percent .
i see .
by the way how can i use it ?
we are very happy to hear that .
thank you for your consideration . you know we are looking forward to seeing you as soon as possible .
you are funny .
it 's very kind of you to help me .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i have but i do n't think so .
well thanks for the help .
we ca n't put up with it any more .
all right .
okay .
i ll pick that up .
that s fine . i ll have to get it fixed soon .
could i have one more blanket ?
i see .
yes we do .
i think the inspection bureau at your end when effecting inspection only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly most probably escaped their attention . as the amount in question is only of the whole shipment i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
all right . got it .
i think so .
when can i get there ?
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i am .
what kind of people do you like to be ?
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
sure .

i 'm interested in the position .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you .
i was hoping to arrive early next month .

what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .

yes i do . right here .
the company will provide you with training opportunity .
when are you coming back ?
i 'm really sorry . i 'll face the music .

sure . what 's up ?
how much would it cost ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here .
no it 's very kind of you .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
this afternoon .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry he is not in at the moment .
when do you expect him to come back ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm afraid not he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes please tell him i called and ask him to return my call as soon as he gets back .
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
i see . i 'll ask mr . tomas you 've called .
when can i come in ?
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
great !
understand .
i 'm sorry sir . what can i do to help ?
poor you so what is wrong with them ?
do you think you 're right ?
cheer up .
really ? i have never thought about that . can i go to your office before ?
maybe you are right but how can you find them ?
don t worry about that . i will inform you as soon as possible .
you 're welcome .
very good .
you mean you can read them ?
what should we do ?
thank you .
i 'll try my best .
here is the rib .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
maybe you should start with that .
thank you so much .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what 's the problem ?
your unit price is dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
i see . well what do you suggest ?
what would you suggest ?
you may choose from the fish and beef .
all right . i 'll take it .
all right that 's the lowest price we can offer .
all right . oh no problem .
i ought to make some money .
i see .
i 'd like to change these dollars please .
no this is our best price .
well in that case there is nothing wrong with it .
of course . as you can rest assured that we have a good deal .
it 's ok with me but if you really do n't mind i 'll call her later .
thank you .
what is the price of these ?
well i 'd like to use the machines .
of course . here you are .
sounds like a good idea .
all right .
what 's the quality of the pictures ?
yes i have eight years of teaching experience in sales .
here you are .
fine i 'll bring that up right away .
i ll do that .
now we need to .
ok . thank you very much .
she 's in a bit of a hurry .
that s a good idea . what about the kitchen ?
are you sure ?
how could you work with him ?
i hope so .
but i still have to think about it .
what are your salary expectations ?
ok mr . wang .
good . we will send the room to you as soon as possible .
how much is it ?
yes that 's right .
thank you very much .
to be honest i really ca n't believe it .
have you thought about it ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
i do n't know . i am always happy about the job .
what happened ?
i 'm quite sure .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
what 's the brand ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
sure there is .
what is the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
yes you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
that 's nice .
surely there is something wrong with your meter .
yes . you 're right .
okay i understand .
i want to work in a bank .
i can help you with that .
hello .
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness <unk> . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
i have this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set <unk> . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because i would like to get a new one .
right .
sure .
that 's right .
please fill out the table .
cool ! sit down . what are you doing ?
i think so .
hope you do n't mind .
thank you .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works .
i get rib every month .
i d like to start another month .
why are you choose to work with them ?
remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
you have days paid vacation every year .
i want to know about fees .
yes we are happy to hear from you .
yes i suppose you are right .
you can start next week .
any other benefits ?
good . shall we say seven o 'clock ?
got it .
sure .
are you sure you are here ?
i 'm going to get one for myself . they make really good coffee here .
why not ?
how much would you like ?
yes .
no problem .
your flight takes off at
i will send it by airmail .
i 'm not ready to go .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
fine . thank you .
for me ?
come here please . i 'd like to make a reservation .
that 's great ! i know your company is a good reputation .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
that s fine . i am really sorry about that .
yes . i did n't know that much about him .
i see . do you have anything else in the company ?
that sounds reasonable .
bye !
i had no idea .
yes i m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
i 've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . is that true ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
that 's a good idea .
that s a good idea .
good idea . i m looking forward to watching it on tv .
what you mean ?
we have plenty of work at the moment .
do you think that it 's a good idea ?
how do you think about it ?
me too .
like what ?
bummer . . .
but is n't there anyone else that you 're looking for ?
why is that ?
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
i am very impressed by your resume . therefore i am very interested to know why you re willing to leave your current company .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
they 've got everything .
what 's the point ?
i guess you are looking at the point .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take weeks on the open ocean and will be your responsibility you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles .
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
what is the actual price ?
ok .
can you tell me about it ?
what do you mean by that ?
no i think so .
sounds very good .
we 're working on it .
is there a lot of nightlife in your country ?
why is that ?
is that expensive ?
no problem . we just hope our discussion can make it .
what 's your proposal then ?
it will be best for me .
well it sounds like a lot of fun .
thank you very much .
what about the hotel accommodations ?
well right .
oh i see .
turn the lights off .
anything else ?
oh i guess i did n't do that .
wonderful .
that s interesting .
i 've got a bachelor 's degree in charge of <unk> . i would have to work in the finance department .
i ca n't believe that .
yeah you are right .
what seems to be the problem ?
ok .
oh that 's very kind of you .
that s okay .
i 'm sure we 'll get on well .
yes of course . that s why <unk> is important to carry all of them .
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained and offer me opportunity for advancement .
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what s more your company is outstanding in this field .

pardon ?
where did it happen ?
well here you go .

are there any good programs on tv ?
that 's what i wanted .
you 'd better hurry up !
let 's call it a day .
how did you do that ?
what do you think about it ?
that 's really convenient .
do you have a cell phone with you ?
this is the kitchen . every thing 's new .
i do n't know .
you must have thought about it .
what do you mean ?
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the <unk> centre of the <unk> faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
well i think there 's a fight on it .
i understand .
nope .
that 's a good idea .
i agree with you .

i do n't know . it 'll save me a lot of money .
you said it .
because it 's not practical at all .
all right . what about you ?
i am here . what are you doing ?
oh no !
i really want to see a movie tonight .

i am sorry sir . just sign here please .
yes please .
hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
you are right . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of <unk> and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members .
what s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce <unk> . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
hi this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by <unk> company .
