 some high speed chase scene  i think  .  
 i wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that  .

 dry  .  that 's my problem  .  
 you can use this  .  it has special effect for keeping your face moisturized  .  it has this lotion  as a gift attached  .  
 sounds good  .  what about shampoo  ?  i would like to buy the product that prevents scurf  .  
 how about this one  ?  it is wellknown for the effect of removing scurf  .  
 is it a newcomer  ?  
 yes  it is a new brand  .

 purple  .  but today  i 'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour  .  
 yes  i see  .  how do you like this one  ?  
 may i have a try  ?  
 certainly  .  
 it 's still too dark  .  any brighter colours  ?  
 not from this brand  i 'm afraid  .  
 what about other brands  ?  
 how about this one  ?  
hey  mom  look what i found  !  
who ate the cookies that were sitting here  ?  
 i did  mom  .  
can you tell me what 's included in your warranty  ?  
 certainly  .  the product has a twoyear guarantee  .  if it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge  .  our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty  .  this covers you for a further two years  .  
 i see  .  what does that include  ?  
 it covers all parts and labour  except for normal wear and tear of course  .  
 what sort of response time do you guarantee  ?  
 our engineers are on call  hours a day  .  we guarantee someone will be with you within four hours  but in practice it 's often much sooner  .  
 are there any exclusions  ?  
i 'm so sorry about your brother  mr  .  wang  .  
 thanks  jane  .  
i need something to wash this down  .  is there any juice in the fridge  ?  
 what is that  ?  it looks like something from a swamp  !  
 it 's a green drink  .  it 's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals  .  
 you know  healthy eating does n't have to make you gag  .  
 the sales lady said that even if i eat right  i would n't get enough vitamins  .  
 have you ever tried it  ?  or are you just going to believe the sales lady  ?  
 it 's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day  .  
can i help you  ?  
 i need some stamps  .  
 what kind of stamps do you want  ?  
 how much do i need for this letter  ?  
 i must weigh it  .  
 how much  ?  is it overweight  ?  
 it is  grams overweight  .  do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter  ?  
 how much is it  then  ?  
 registration plus overweight   yuan in all  .  
hi barbara  .  have you lost weight  ?  
 hi julie  .  yeah  .  i 've been on a diet for a couple of months now  .  
 wow  .  you look great  .  
 thanks for noticing  .  
 what type of diet were you on  ?  
 i joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating  .  with a combination of eating better and exercising  i managed to lose  pounds in  months  .  
 that 's amazing  .  what tips did your trainer give you  ?  
 mostly on how to exercise  but the best advice i got was changing my eating habits  .  instead of eating  times a day  she told me to eat  times a day  .  
 that does n't make sense  .  if you eat more  than how do you lose weight  ?  
 actually  i 'm eating the same amount  .  i eat  smaller meals a day  .  basically  it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate  .  
 that makes sense  .  i 'm going to try that  .  
 you do n't need to lose weight  .  
 i have a little gut i have been trying to get rid of  .  
 ah  .  .  .  but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet  .  
 thanks for the advice  .  
nancy  please turn the tv down  .  
 come on  john  .  this is my favorite show  .  
i 'm sleepy  .  i can hardly keep my eyes open  .  
 why do n't you go to bed  ?  
nathan said he did n't have any fun at his new school this week  .  do you know why  ?  
 i think he has n't made any new friends yet  .  he 's just a little lonely  .  
 he really misses his friends from our old neighborhood  .  
 without a doubt  .  maybe if he knew he does n't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones  it will be easier for him  .  
 how do you propose to help him understand that  ?  
 well  we can help him keep in touch with his old friends  .  
 i guess we could go visit once in a while too  .  
oops  !  
 what happened  ?  
 i overcooked the corn  .  
i 'm freezing  .  turn down the air conditioner  will you  ?  
 but then it 'll be too warm  .  
hi  i 'm home  !  can you double that recipe  ?  i ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner  .  
 no problem  .  who is it  ?  anyone i know  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  do you remember bob gain from tulsa  ?  
 that name does n't ring a bell  .  but tell me more  .  
 he was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day  .  
 well  i 'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake  .  
 you 're glad he saved me  huh  ?  
can you believe her  ?  she is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet  .  
 tell me about it  .  if i was as small as her  i would n't think about going on a diet  .  
 me too  .  but what are we going to do  ?  i have been on  different diets and i ca n't seem to lose weight  .  
 that 's because you do n't exercise  .  if you were more active  you would n't have a dieting problem  .  
 what do you know  ?  you are over weight too  .  
 i 'm not on a diet though  .  
 i know  .  but i do n't have someone to diet with  .  if we help each other and motivate each other  then i think we can lose some weight  .  
 i like ice cream too much though  .  
 c 'mon  .  you 'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there  .  
 it does sound appealing  .  
 it 's a great idea  .  i ca n't believe i did n't think of this earlier  .  going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed  .  
 okay  .  i 'm in  .  let 's do it  .  
 great  .  i 'll get our plan started right away  .  
i need to buy some fruit  .  
 all the fruit are pretty fresh here  .  
 how much are the pears  ?  
 they 're four yuan per kilo  .  
 give me one kilo of those  please  .  do you have any fresh plums  ?  
 yes  we do  .  they are eight yuan per kilo  .  
 it 's a bit too expensive  .  we can get it for six yuan in the shop next here  .  
 take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo  .  
 sounds reasonable  .  i 'll take three kilos  .  
 ok  .  it 's  yuan 
what happened to your car  ?  
 a tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car  .  
 are they going to pay you for the damages  ?  
 they 're saying it was already there  .  
 what the hell  .  that does n't make sense  .  what are you going to do  ?  
 i have to go to court  .  a cop was there so he can prove that the damage was n't there  .  
 that sucks  .  i 'd be pissed if that happened to me  .  
 i got an estimate and it 's four thousand dollars  .  
 oh my gosh  .  damn  .  .  .  screw the court  i would burn down their store  .

hello  are you interested in this honda  ?  
 hi  i am just looking  .  
 it 's a good car  .  
 what year is it  ?  
   .  
 how about the mileage  ?  
  miles  all highway mileage  .  
 what do you mean b 
 highway miles are not as bad as local miles  .  they do not hurt car as much  .  
 oh  why such a high mileage  ?  
 the owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line  .  
 okay  .  does this car have a warranty  ?  
 one month  .  
 how do i make sure i am not buying a junk  ?  
 you 'll check it out anyway you want  .  you can take it to a garage  .  
 how much is it  ?  
    .  
 i 'll have to think about it  .  
 leave your phone number  and i will give you a call if the price gets reduced  .  
what else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in  ?  
 we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings  .  
 i 'm the painter  .  you can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains  .  that will probably be pretty expensive too  .  having good curtains made is n't cheap  .  
 you mean we ca n't just buy curtains already made  ?  
 absolutely not  .  the windows must be measured  and then the curtains need to be made professionally  .  so that will take a while  .  maybe a month or so  .  
 while the curtains are being made  i can start having people look at the kitchen  .  i ca n't stand that old kitchen  .  i wo n't be able to cook there  .  i do n't want to use that electric stove  .  
 we need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen  .  i believe in portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation  .  i will look in the yellow pages  .  i 'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green  .  
 i agree  .  the colors must be soft and pleasant  .  you should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners  .  
 me  ?  cook our dinners  ?  hah  !  you will be cooking  dear  .  you will cook  .  
 no  i do n't think so  .  i 'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room  .  
 well  i suppose we 'll have to hire a cook then  .  so you wo n't be able to afford any clothes next year  .  
 and you 'll have to sell your motorcycle  .  and your cameras  .  right  ?  
 maybe i 'll cook once or twice a week  .  how is that  ?  
hi  mike  .  i am going to move on the first of next month  .  
 congratulations  !  so  have you started planning your move  ?  
 yes  i am trying to find good movers now  .  do you know any  ?  
 not really  .  
 what did you do for your last move  ?  
 since i did not have much staff  i asked my cousin to help me out  .  
 oh  .  that 's very nice of him  .  
 yeah  it was  .  but i still have some information that i collected last time  and if you want  i will give it to you  .  
miss  may i help you  ?  
 yes  i just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different  .  
 it 's because of the view  .  
 oh  !  i see  .  can you show me the location of block i  ?  
 sure  .  please take a look at the model of the building  .  nice garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled block i and block ii  .  block i has a total of thirtyeighth floors  .  the thirtyseventh and thirtyeighth are penthouses  .  there are four units in one floor  .  the sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet  .  the size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms  .  
 how many elevators are there  ?  
 there are three elevators between one hundred and fortyeight units  .  
 how about the carpark space  ?  
 there are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor  in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents  .  
 any other facilities  ?  
 sure  on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter  .  there are two swimming pools  .  one is olympic standard size and the other one is for children  .  also  there is a gymnasium for resident members only  .  
 what is the completion date  ?  
 the completion date will be july st   .  
 how about the price and the bank mortgage  ?  
 please check up the price list  .  the average unit price is five million hong kong dollars  .  there are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan  .  also  the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers  .  
 how many payment methods are there  ?  
 it 's all written on the brochure price list  .  i believe there will be one right for you  .  please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone  .  
 thank you  .  i think i have to talk to the bank representatives  .  thank you for your help  .  
you know  i 'm a pretty laidback person  .  i do n't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things  .  for example  i like to keep the apartment clean too  but if it gets a little dirty once in a while  that 's not a big deal  .  
 i totally agree  .  i really like my lifestyle to be dramafree  and i do n't want to argue about cleaning the apartment  .  my last roommate was a drama queen  .  every time i forgot to take my shoes off  she got really mad and made a big deal out of it  .  
 yeah  i really do n't want a lot of drama in the apartment  .  it 's important that we do n't get on each other 's nerves  .  
excuse me  could you tell me which bus i should take to go to the railway station  ?  
 i think you 'd better take the no  .   bus  .  it can take you right there  .  
 how often dose this bus go there  ?  
 every fifteen minutes  .  
 i really ca n't wait that long  .  are there any other buses that can take me there  ?  
 the no  .   bus also goes to the railway station  .  you may take it  .  
 where can i find the bus  ?  
 the bus stop is not far from here  .  go straight on and you can easily find it  .  
 thanks a lot  .  
good morning  madam  .  what can i do for you  ?   !  
 i 'd like a coffee please  .  
 certainly  madam  .  what kind of coffee would you like  ?  
 what have you got  ?  
 well  we have espresso  cappuccino  latte  skinny latte and americano  .  
 goodness me  !  so many choices  !  i think i 'll have a cappuccino please  .  
hi steve  it 's nice to meet you  .  i hear that you 're looking for an apartment  and i just rented a twobedroom downtown  .  i 'm looking for a compatible roommate  .  
 great  i 'm looking for a place right in that area  .  your apartment sounds ideal  .  
 alright  .  so tell me  how would you describe yourself  ?  
 i 'm pretty social and outgoing  and i like making new friends  .  but i 'm not a party animal  and i like to keep the apartment clean  .  
what is your favorite coffee  ?  
 irish coffee is my favorite  .  but i 'm not particular on it  .  
 all right  .  would you make coffee yourself when you are at home  ?  
 not very often  .  making coffee is a bit troublesome  .  most of the time  i just buy takeout at starbucks  .  and also  i quite like instant coffee  .  
 i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular  .  though its taste is not perfect  it 's really cheap and convenient  .  
 exactly  .  nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee  .  people love it all over the world  .  
 i agree  .  i heard that in the western countries  almost everyone likes coffee  .  is that true  ?  
 yes  .  no doubt about that  .  for us  coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink  .  i heard chinese people do n't drink that much coffee  .  
 no  we do n't  especially the elder people  .  but more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays  .  
excuse me  is this where i can catch a bus to the museum  ?  
 yes  you 're at the right stop  .  
 thank you  .  
 are you new here  ?  
 yes  .  
 have you got small change  ?  they require exact fare  .  
 yes  i 've got some coins  .  how much is the fare  ?

 well  i think there 's one across from the shopping center  .  
 thank you  .  
 by the way  there 's a barber shop in the shopping center  too  .  
is this the right bus for san francisco  ?  
 it sure is . can i see your ticket  ?  ok  fine  .  
 when's the first stop  ?  
 about two hours out of los angeles  .  give me the bags  i 'll put 'em on the bus  .  here 's your claim tag  .  do n't lose it . when you get off the bus  give it to me  .  
 thank you  .  
 is it all right to smoke on the bus  ?  
 sure  but only in the rear  and only cigarettes  .  and alcohol is not allowed  .  
now i 'm sure we 'll never get all our things back  .  they 're so clever these criminals  .  what 's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal  ?  
 i only wish it were this time yesterday  .  
 think how happy we were  .  now this . things always go wrong  .  
 perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast  .  we 'd feel better  .  
 i do n't feel like breakfast  .  i do n't feel like anything  .  why are we so unlucky  ?  it 's as if there were a jinx on us  .  
 perhaps i 'd better ring the police  .  .  .  
jane  !  what an enchanting skirt you have on  !  
 thank you  !  guess how much it costs  .  
 bright colors  smooth material  exquisite craftsmanship  soft lines  .  .  .  darling  it looks elegant on you  !  it ca n't be any cheap stuff  .  something around two hundred  i guess  .  
 your offer is way off the mark  .  it set me back only sixtyfive  .  
 then you got a windfall  !  was sixtyfive the original price  or did you get a special discount  ?  
 neither  .  i drove a hard bargain with the vendor before i got the price down  .  
 how much did she ask for  ?  
 three hundred  !  that 's daylight robbery  .  how dare she play tricks on an old hand like me  ?  without hesitation  i gave my offerno more than fifty  .  
 she must be fuming with anger at such a bid  was n't she  ?  
 not at all  !  she 's really been around  and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this  .  that 's the trade  .  she only demanded a higher bid  saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy  .  she was lying  !  then i inquired  may i have it at sixty  ?  she waved her head  .  
 then you pretended to go without buying it  ?  
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china  .  it 's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers  !  you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something  .  
 cool down  harry  !  what are you really mad about  ?  did you get ripped off  ?  
 yes  .  last sunday i went to a nearby market  .  it was on openair fair  .  i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot  without even trying to strike a bargain  .  i paid one hundred and twenty  .  and just now i was told by my chinese colleagues i bought it overpriced  .  i could have talked my way to thirty  .  
 is that so  ?  i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you  .  bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals  .  it 's the norm of free trade  .  the seller sets a preposterous price  and the buyer tries his best to bring it down  until a compromise is reached  .  yet you ignored the process  .  no wonder you ended up easy prey  .  
 but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin  ?  
gosh  it 's   i 'll miss the first class  .  
 do n't get up so late next time  .  you should have gone to bed earlier last night  .  
is your father in the habit of having naps  ?  
 yes  all of us have naps  .  
 do n't you feel dizzy when you have to get up  ?  
when do you go to bed usually  ?  
 i go to bed at ten and get up at six  .  
 that 's helpful for your health  .  
are you ready  pa  ?  
 in a second  .  have you got a torch  ?  
 no  .  
let 's see if we forget anything  .  
 oh  we need an umbrella  .  the weather is so changeable in that area  .  
 yes  let 's go  .  lock the door  please  .  
hello  i  d like to speak to kate  .  
 i  m sorry she is not in at the moment  .  can i take a message  ?  
 it  s ok  .  i  ll call her back latter  .  thank you  .  
how much is this shirt  please  ?  
 it 's  yuan  .  
 do you have it in a larger size  ?  
your daughter will be back soon  .  i 'm going to start making dinner  .  you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like  .  we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen  .  the remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair  .  
 would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead  ?  i do enjoy cooking  .  
 this is supposed to be your vacation  we 'd like you to just relax  .  
 cooking makes me feel relaxed  .  so  what are we cooking  ?  
 ok  well  we 're going to make a pan of lasagne  a salad  and some garlic bread  .  here 's the recipe  .  do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard  ?  
 sure  .  we should probably preheat the oven right away  too  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  can you set the oven to  degrees celsius  ?  
 that 's a bit high for lasagne  .  i 'll just set it at  degree and we can take it from there  .  
 fine  .  i 'll just get out the casserole dish  the saucepan  the salad bowl  and the baking sheet  .  
 you know  i could do this myself  .  why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better  ?  
 i do n't think it 's broken  .  
 well  if it 's not broken  then you need to learn how to vacuum better  because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages  !  
excuse me  do you go to the central park  ?  
 yes  this is the right bus  .  
 could you please tell me when i get to the central park  ?  
 do n't worry  .  i 'll call out the stops  .  
  a few minutes later  .   should i get off at the next stop  ?  
 no  do n't worry  .  i 'll get you off when you get there  .  
 is it a long ride  ?  
 no  not that long  .  two more stops  and you 'll get off  sir  .  
 ok  .  i know  .  thank you  .  
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night  ?  
 of course  .  is the dinner still on  ?  
 yes  i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place  .  
 we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice  .  
 that 's what i thought you would do  .  listen  i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood  .  it 's just down the street from all the bars  .  you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark  .  
 it ca n't be that bad  .  
 i wish it was n't  but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here  .  
 really  ?  i never would have guessed  .  the criminals must only come out in the evenings  because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime  .  
 do me a favor  and take a taxi  .  it 'd make me feel a lot better  .  
 ok  we will  .  how do you get around in the evenings  ?  
 when i first moved in  i walked everywhere  .  but within a week  i had my purse stolen  just a block away from the police station  !  now  i always take public transportation  .  
 has anything else happened to you  ?  
 nothing else has happened to me  but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close  .  
excuse me  i  ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes . do you know why the traffic is so heavy  ?  
 a lorry overturned on the road and blocked it  so all the traffic was held up  .  
 oh  what a terrible situation  !  this traffic is unbearable  .  
 yeah  traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident  .  if we had gone early we would miss the traffic  .  
 i agree with you  .  but now we have to wait  .  the sky is overcast  and it is very sultry  .  i fear a thunder storm is brewing  .  
 don  t worry  .  the traffic jam is said to be over soon  .  
 yes  i hope so  .  thank you for telling me this  .  
julia  julia  julia  .  my daring julia  what 's wrong with you  ?  
 steven  are you talking to me  ?  
 yes  i have called you three times  .  what makes you in a daze  ?  
 i was thinking about the accident i saw in the morning  .  i was petrified when two cars collided  .  i witnessed the traffic accident  .  
 did someone get hurt  ?  
 a driver died instantly  .  the other one was badly hurt  .  a poor boy called peter was killed in the accident too  .  
 what a terrible accident  !  who should be responsible for this traffic accident  ?  
 i think both  .  they drove too fast  .  what 's worse  one of them was drunk  .  
 why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk  ?  
hello  !  is your taxi engaged  ?  
 no  this taxi is free  .  
 please take me to the honging hotel  .  
 ok  .  please get in  .  i 'm glad to serve you  .  
 could you get there in twenty minutes  ?  
 it will take half an hour to get to the hotel  .  
 i am in a hurry  .  please take a shortcut  .  i have a friend waiting for me  .  
 ok  i promise we 'll get there in twenty minutes  .  
it 's such a nice day outside  .  let  s take a walk into town and do some windowshopping  .  
 you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world  .  
 i know  .  but we could get some exercise in  and we could get some errands run  too  .  windowshopping won  t cost you anything  .  
 what kind of errands do we need to run  ?  
 well  we could go to the newsagent 's to pick up the sunday paper  go to the butcher 's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner  and to the chemist 's to pick up your prescription from the doctor  .  
 i 'll only go if we can stop at the officelicense to pick up something to drink for tonight  .  
 fine  we 'll do that on the way home  so we don  t have to carry it the whole time  .  
 sounds good  .  you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though  .  i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms  especially if the stores have special offers  .  
 i promise  .  we 're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven  t had time for  .  
 ok  let 's go then  !  
 do you have any money  ?  
 for what  ?  
 for our errands  and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street  .  
 you said you were only going to window shop  !  
 i agreed to not go into the mall  but i can still look at things in the market  !  
what time does the museum close  ?  any idea  ?  
 i 'm not sure  but i think it 's open until  o 'clock  .

  later  everything looks tempting  .  what do you want to have  ?  
 kebabs and roast squid  .

 help yourself  .

 to the right  .  
  the hair stylist cuts the customer 's hair  .   almost done  .  i just have to even things up a bit  .   she shows the customer the results  .   will that do  ?  
 looks good  .  
 would you like a shave  ?

 no  thank you  .  i do n't need any skirts  .

 you like it  .  well  i 'll gather it for you  .  
 you must n't pick it in this place  .  
 where is it  ?  
excuse me  sir  ?  
 yes  ?  
 i 'm afraid you ca n't smoke here  .  
 why not  ?  
 ca n't you see the notice here  ?  
 i 'm sorry  .  i ca n't  .  what does the note say  ?  
 it says no smoking  .  
you must n't touch the wet paint  bill  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i wo n't do it again  .

 is this the sign  ?  what does it say  ?  
oh dear  my weight has gone up again  .  
 i am not surprised  you eat too much  .  
 and i suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office does n't help  .  
 no  i would n't think so  .  
 i do wish i could lose weight  .  
 well  why do n't you go on a diet  ?  
 i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked  .  
 perhaps you should excercise more  .  why do n't you go to an exercise class  .  
i work so hard that i do not have the energy to exercise  .  
 that is just an excuse  .  you can always find some time to exercise  .  
 but i work hard all the time for long hours  .  often i have no time for lunch  .  yet  i am still getting fatter  .  
 bill  you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing  .  and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals  .  
 i know you 're right  but what can i do  ?  
 how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night  ?  
 but i 'll miss the news  .  it 's important in my business to keep up with events in china  .  
 i know  i know  .  have you got a portable radio  ?  you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time  .  
how do you want your eggs  mary  ?  cindy likes hers scrambled  .  
 sunnyside up  please  .

 what kind of bread do we have  ?  
 white and wholewheat  .  
 i think i 'll have two slices of whole wheat  .  
 can you go wake up cindy for me  ?  
 sure  .  
peter  how often do you exercise  ?  
 well  i swim and run every day  .  
 now  tell me  what do you eat  ?  
 well  i do n't eat any meat  but i do eat fish and eggs  .  
 do you eat a lot of vegetables  ?  
 oh yes  and fruit  i love fruit  .  
 what do you drink  ?  
 well  i never drink alcohol  coffee or tea  .  they are very bad for you  .  
hi jane  you look great  .  
 you too  .  have you lost some weight  ?  
 yes  i took off  kilos  .  i am glad you notice it  .  
 not some crazy diet fat i hope  .  
 no no  i just changed my eating habits  .  i eat a balanced meal  .  and i eat less than before  .

alison  would you like to have some more  ?  
 no  thanks  .  i 've had enough  .  
 actually you have n't had much  .  
 to tell you the truth  i am on a diet  .  
 that sounds ridiculous  .  why  ?  
linda  would you care for some candies or cookies  ?  
 no  do n't try to tempt me  .  i 'm becoming chubby  and i have to slim down  .  
 you are not really chubby  .  you are actually thin enough  .  
 i do n't think so  .  i know i 've put on weight this winter  .  
 so you are watching your weight  are n't you  ?  
shall we share a taxi  ?  
 where are you heading now  ?  
 i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road  .  it is very close to your house  .  
 is that the university next to the teachers college  ?  
 that 's the one  .  
 you mean we 'll share the taxi  ?  
 yeah  .  if we share the cab  it 'll be cheaper  .  besides that your chinese is better than mine  .  the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully  .  
where is that  ?  
 take me to the airport  please  .  
  while driving  are you in a hurry  ?

 no  you need n't  .  a number  bus will also take you to the hospital  .  
 number  buses run much more frequently  do n't they  ?  
 yes  .  i caught a number  bus yesterday  and they said i had taken a wrong bus  .

 oh  she did  ?  then it 's a used car of course  .  
 yes  it 's used  but she said it was in very good shape  .  it 's a small foreign car  .

 she thinks it has about twentyfive or thirty thousand miles  .  
 that 's not bad  .  what about the price  ?  did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car  ?  
 three thousand dollars  .  
 three thousand  !  that 's almost too good to be true  .  did she say why her friend wants to sell it  ?

 well  we can see it for ourselves  .  did she tell you when we can go and look at it  ?  
hi  nancy  .  how are you doing  ?  
 hi  tom  .  want a cup of coffee  ?

 well  yeah  but i 'd be getting somebody else 's problems  .  
 uh huh  .  how about a used car  ?  they 've got good ones now  .  
 it 's the same kind of deal though  you know  you never know what you 're going to get  .  
 oh  hey  how about a new car  ?  they 've got easy loans now  .  you 'd feel so good driving a new car  .  
may i ask you for a dance  .  
 certainly  i love waltz very much  .  
 you dance it very well  .  do you often go dancing  ?  
would you like to learn to tango donar  ?  
 right now  ?  
 i am offering you my services  .  for your church  .  what do you say  ?  
 i think i 'll be a little afraid  .  
 of what  ?  
 afraid of making a mistake  .  
 no mistakes in a tango donar . not like life  simple  that will make the tango so great  .  if you make a mistake  you 'll get all tango done  .  just tango along  .  why do n't you try  ?  will you try it  .  
shall we dance  ?  
 sure  .  i suppose you dance much  .  
 oh  .  no as a matter of fact  i have n't danced for a long time  .

 oh  i like this music very much  let 's tango  .  
mom  where are you going  ?  
 i am going to buy some food to cook for supper  .  
 good  .  i wanna come with you  .  
 how strange  !  our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping  .  
 we learnt about vegetables and meat at school  .  but i never see the real thing  .  
 wow  that 's something new  .  let 's go  !  what 's this  honey  ?  
 er  is it cabbage  ?  
 cabbage  ?  is that what they teach at school now  ?  ok  honey  it 's spinage  .  
 yeah  i know  this is popeye 's favorite food  .  
 there we go  .  
 mom  come here  .  i know this  it is carrot  am i right  ?  
hey joe  what are you doing in this department store  ?  
 hi  rita  i 'm just looking for a pair of shoes  .  i wo n't be here for long  .  
 why not  ?  when i go shoe shopping  i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices  .  
 that 's my problem  .  i do n't have a lot of options  .  
 what do you mean  ?  this is a big store  is n't it  ?  
 yes  but i have unusually big feet  .  that would n't be too much of a problem except that they 're also very wide  and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into  .  
 so how do you usually go about buying shoes  then  ?  
 well  first of all  i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection  .  
 well  you 're in the right store  .  if they do n't have it  no one will  .  
sir  may i please see your license and registration  ?  do you know how fast you were going  ?  
 no  i 'm not sure  .  i think about  mph  right  ?  
 you 're not sure  ?  you were going at  miles per hour  !  that 's  mph over the legal speed limit  !  have you been drinking  ?  
 no  officer  not at all  .  
 then how can you explain your behavior  ?  
 well  i guess i just was n't paying attention to the speedometer  .  
 not paying attention to the speedometer  ?  why not  ?  
 um  because i was busy talking to my friend  .  
 on a cell phone  ?  
 yes  i was using a cell phone  .  i just bought it  so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it  .  while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs  and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant  and  um  .  .  .  guess i had too many distractions  .  
let  s move out of here  .  this apartment is too small  .  
 i agree  .  i  ll look in the paper  .  
 a house would be great  .  i could plant a garden  .  and you could use the garage for a workshop  .  
 here  s an interesting ad 
 how much is the rent  ?  
 the ad says   plus deposit  .  
 when is the place available  ?  
i can  t believe the cost of apartments in new york city  .  
 oh  you didn  t know that apartments here are considered valuable  even if they are small and crowded  ?  
 of course i had heard about that  but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here  .  
 i don  t mind paying high rent to live in new york  .  
 why  ?  you pay so much for such a tiny space to live  .  
can you tell me how to reach the bank please  ?  
 which bank  ?  there are two  the allied irish bank and the bank of ireland  .  
 i have an air pass card and i want to withdraw money from the bank  .  
 you need to go to the allied irish bank which is near the local shopping centre  dunned stores  .  
 how do i get there  .  i have no knowledge of this area  .  
 cross the road and turn left at the other side  .  walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights  .  you will see a shopping centre on the right hand side  .  walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre  .  keep going straight for about m and the bank is to your left  .  
 it sounds very complicated  .  how far is it from here  ?  
 it 's not so complicated  .  it 's about five minutes walk from here  .  i can draw a map for you if you wish  .  
 oh  i would really appreciate that  .  by the way will i be going north or south  ?  
what does a housing go for in south mountain district  ?  
 it depends on the type of the house you 're looking for  .  
 we  re looking for a threebedroom home  .  
 what  s your general price range  ?  
 under  rib  we suppose  .  
 umm  i think i would be hard to find something in that range in this area  .  you know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest  .  
 what about a twobedroom house  ?  
 a twobedroom house in this area is generally around  rib  .  
 i see  .  
 i recommend you buy a twobedroom house  .  it is very suitable for a couple  and some twobedroom houses are large enough for a onechild family  .  
hey there chris  what are you up to  ?  
 i 'm just poring over some brochures about various car models  .  
 oh  so you 're thinking about buying a new car  ?  
 yeah  it looks that way  .  my wife has been bugging me about it  .  i thought we could probably survive without one  but with a baby on the way  maybe it is time to get a car  .  
 so this would be your first automobile  ?  
 that 's right  .  for quite a few years  i rode a bicycle to work  .  then i got a motorbike  .  
 yeah  i think i can understand your wife 's position  .  asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she 's pregnant is a tall order  .  
 oh  .  .  .  i do n't let her ride with me  .  it 's just too dangerous  .  she takes the bus to work  but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it 's crowded and hot  .  
 so it 's time to buy your very first car  !  wow  that 's exciting  !  
 yes  but it 's also a pretty big financial responsibility  .  
 yeah  .  i still remember my first car  .  it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned   .  i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car  .  
 i 'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us  .  
 yeah  it is a tough call  .  each one has its pros and cons  .  are you looking for a sedan  ?  
 yes  i 'd like a jeep  but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives  .  
this house is very nice for me  but i can  t afford it in a lump sum  .  
 don  t worry  you can pay in an installment  that is to say  you don  t have to pay the whole amount of money at once  .  
 that  s good  .  will you tell me the details  ?  
 certainly  you need to pay a deposit at first  and you will pay the rest monthly  .  
 how long will it take  ?  
 it depends  .  
 i need to talk it over with my wife  .  
i heard you are looking for a house  .  
 yes  .  
 how is this going  ?  
 i haven  t found one that satisfies my demands yet  .  
 i can recommend an apartment for you  .  a friend of mine is about to move  .  she doesn  t want to rent that house any longer  .  
 where is the house  ?  
 it is on spring avenue  .  
 really  !  so it is just near my office building  .  great  !  how much is the rent  ?  
 it  s   a month  .  
 does that include utilities  ?  
 it includes water  but not gas and electricity  .  
 that  s a little expensive  .  
 but it  s very convenient for you to walk to work  .  
 yes  .  i won  t have to take a bus to go to my office  .  is it a onebedroom apartment  ?  
 yes  it is  .  
 that is what i am looking for  .  could i go to see the house tomorrow afternoon  ?  
 certainly  !  but i have to contact my friend first  .  
are you looking for an apartment  ?  
 yes  i am interested in finding a onebedroom apartment near washington square  .  
 i think i have just a right apartment for you  .  
 oh  good  .  can you describe it  ?  
 yes  .  it has one bedroom  a large living space and  kitchens  .  
 so is there a refrigerator  ?  
 yes  it  s brandnew  .  
 it sounds great  .  how much is the rent  ?  
 it  s   .  a month  .  
 when can i see it  ?  
 we can take a see by there now if you like  .  the landlord left me a set of keys with me  .  
your house is very old  .  does it need redecorating  ?  
 yes  it really needs redecorating  .  
 shall i help you with it  ?  
 i don  t suppose you could  .  
 i have much time  .  i suppose it can be done  .  
excuse me  .  i  m a stranger here and lost my way  .  
 can i help you  ?  
 sure  .  can i get to the central department stall this way  ?  
 uh  .  .  .  yes  .  turn right  then take the second turning on your left  .  
 is it far  ?  
 it  s about fifteen minutes  walk  .  that  s all  .  
 and do you know where the national bank is  ?  
 yes  .  it  s on this street  .  keep walking for two blocks and it  s on the corner on the right  .  
 thanks very much  .  
 you are welcome  .  good luck  .  
is there anything wrong  ?  
 i  m worried about my daughter  .  she can  t decide about college  .  
 don  t worry  .  that  s just a part of being a teenager  .  
 i don  t mind that  .  but she disagrees with me about everything  .  
 you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself  .  you shouldn  t affect her decision  .  
 but i just want to give her some tips  .  
 oh  she can make her own decisions  .  
 i guess you are right  .  
 believe me  .  everything will be ok  .  
dick  i  ve decided not to rent that house  .  
 but yesterday you said you would rent it  .  
 i  ve changed my mind  .  
 why is that  ?  
 well  i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work  .  
you  re home late today  david  .  how was school  ?  
 not bad  .  there  s a new english teacher  .  
 oh  what  s she like  ?  
 she is beautiful  .  
 is she old or young  ?  
 she is quite young and her hair is blond  .  
 is she strict  ?  
 not really  .  her eyes are blue  .  
 can she speak chinese  ?  
 not much  .  she is very tall and slim  .  
betty  something is burning  .  can you smell it  ?  
 you  re right  .  
 look  !  the iron is still on  .  
 i should have turned it off  .  i  ll turn it off now  .  
 look at my nice blue shirt  there  s a big hole in it  .  
 i  m sorry  jim  .  
well  peter  you have to do better than that next time  won  t you  ?  
 have i really got to do those exams again  dad  ?  
 of course  you have  .  you must try harder this time  .  
 and must i go back to school  ?  
 no  you needn  t do that  .  you  d better get a parttime job somewhere and go to evening classes  .  
 but dad  i should be working fulltime at my age  .  i  m nearly   .  
 you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn  t have failed your exams  .  you have to take a job and study  .  
 what else i  ve got to do  ?  join the army  ?  
i am so busy today  .  
 can i help you  ?  
 i  m not sure  .  perhaps you could do the shopping  .  
 i  ll be glad to help  .  
 or maybe make the beds  .  
 all you have to do is ask for help  .  
 thanks  .  that  s terrific  !  
jimmy  i  d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party  .  what do you think of it  ?  
 don  t dress like that  .  you  ll make fool yourself  .  you look stupid in that robe  .  
 what  ?  but it is my favorite piece of clothing  .  
 maybe it is  .  but it  s out of fashion  .  
 what am i going to do  ?  
can i give you a lift home  mrs word  ?  
 that is very kind of you  mr lee  .  thank you  .  
 could you hold my umbrella when i get my keys out  please  ?  
 of course  .  it  s a terrible night  isn  t it  ?  
 dreadful  .  there  the door is open now  .  
guess what  gilly  ?  i won both bids  .  
 good for you  .  did you use paypal  ?  
 yeah  .  it was so easy and superfast  once i figured it out  .  
 that 's the beauty of it  and the danger  .  
 i should get the items within a week  .  but in the meantime i 'm bidding on a digital video camera  .  
 how much  ?  
 thirty u  .  s  .  dollars  .  .  .  and it 's only been used for six months  .  
ouch  !  the water 's too hot  !  
 get in slowly  sweetie  .  you 'll get used to it  .  i 'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup  .  
 i 'm not hungry  mom  .  
 i know you do n't have an appetite  but you need to eat something  .  you 'll get too weak if you do n't eat  .  
 oh  .  .  .  i 'm sweating already  .  it 's so hot  .  i can feel it boiling  !  can i get out yet  ?  
hello  mr  .  gao  .  we appreciate your letting us have the apartment  .  
 my pleasure  .  you 're a sweet couple  .  do you have any questions  ?  
 the ad said rent was thirty thousand  .  that includes utilities and phone  i assume  .  
 no  it does n't  .  and there 's a maintenance fee for each month  .  it 's forty nt per ping  .  
 that 's another one thousand six hundred  ?  
you bet it is  .  and we got four thousand for our car space  !  awesome  !  
 let 's play some music  !  i feel like dancing  .  
 that 's just what was running through my mind  .  moonlight and dancing  .  
 ahh  !  now that 's more like it  .  atmosphere  !  
 come on baby  let 's dance  !  
sorry to bother you so early  .  there 's another couple who wants to rent the apartment  but i thought i 'd ask you first  .  
 that 's so sweet of you  .  we definitely want it  .  
 i thought so  by the looks on your faces when you left  .  so why do n't you come to my apartment  and we 'll settle all the details  .  
 ok  .  how does seven o 'clock this evening sound  ?  
my latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month  .  
 and this espresso looks like  .  .  .  oil  !  
 it still tastes fine  though  .  
 these days  i ca n't think of anything but motor oil  .  even coffee makes me think of it  .  
so how long do you plan to live here  ?  
 we 'd like to sign a yearlong contract  if that 's ok  .  
 fine by me  .  do you know how to read this kind of contract  ?  
 yes  .  we 've signed them before  .  we even brought our chops  .  
 great  .  when in rome  you guys know what to do  .  
 we 'll sign our signatures  too  .  and give you our passport numbers along with our arc numbers  .  
that 's really convenient  .  we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent  though  .  
 i can take two thousand off  .  that 'll make the rent twentyeight thousand  .  
 that 's great  .  every little bit counts  .  and we do n't need the parking space  .  i guess we could rent it out  .  
 sure  for at least three thousand per month  .  
 that 'll bring the price down to twentyfive  .  that 's the price we were shooting for  .  
ann  stop bugging jess and help me order something new  .  lattes are so passe these days  .  
 why do n't you try an americano  ?  espresso with water  .  
 sounds a little weak  .  
 go with a hammerhead thenespresso mixed with drip coffee  .  
 sounds better  but i hope it does n't inspire me to take a hammer to the client 's head  .  
any new ideas on the mr  .  fro case  ?  how can we give this motor oil a new brand identity  ?  
 let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again  .  
 i could use one  too  .  i 'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign  .  
telco mobile  how can i help you  ?  
 yes  i  d like to activate my voice mail service please  .  
 certainly sir  we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services  call waiting and also three way calling  .  
 sure that sounds great  !  are there any other fees  ?  
 not at all  .  no hidden fees or surcharges  it is a flat monthly rate  .  
 perfect  .  i also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service  ?  i am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number  .  
do you need help with something  ?  
 i need help finding a new refrigerator  .  
 do you see anything that you like  ?  
 that kenmore looks nice  .

 it 's very inexpensive  and it has all the appliances  .

 take a look inside  .  
hey mel  !  are you up for some tennis today  ?  
 sorry  i can  t  !  i have to go to work  pick up jake and maddie from school  and make them an afternoon snack  then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class  .  
 you sound exhausted  .  maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out  !  she can pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool activities  .  she can also help you do some household chores  and run some errands  .  
 oh  i don  t know  .  .  .  it  s hard to find the right nanny  .  you have to consider her previous work experience  the responsibilities you give her  and how she interacts with the kids  .  i would love to have someone to help me out  though  .  
 i think you should definitely consider it  !  this way you won  t have to juggle such a busy schedule  and you  ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings  .  i can refer you this great nanny amy  .  she used to work for my neighbors  before they moved away  .  she  s very responsible  a good cook  and great with kids  .  
hello  sir  what can i do for you today  ?

 i 'd like to see it for myself  .  
 go right ahead  .  
those are today  s top stories  .  now let  s go to john for the weather  .  john  what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers  ?  
 i  m afraid we  re in for a rough weekend  marry  .  there is a storm system moving through the east coast  .  it will be drizzling all day today  and there  s a  percent chance of thunderstorms this evening  .  it will be warm and humid all weekend  .  in the midwest  expect strong winds and a low of around  degrees  .  
 that  s pretty chilly for the summer  !  will it rain on saturday  ?  
 unfortunately  yes  .  it will be clear early saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day  .  there is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the southeast  .  folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding  especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls  .  
 that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday  .  
 it gets better on sunday  though  .  the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night  .  it will still be rather cool  with highs in the low s  .  the west coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather  but at least the sun will come out  .  i advise weekend travelers to be careful  especially while driving  .  back to you  mark  .

 green beans  .  they pop and turn brown when you roast them  .  
 cool  !  but is n't that a hot air popcorn popper  ?

 you mean halfandhalf  ?  
 yep  .  that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames  .  
 good idea  .  
this broth is wonderful  .  what 's in it  ?  
 lamb and beef  .  it will get even tastier when we add the veggies  !  
 hey  !  watch out  !  you 're using the same spoon for both broths  !  
 so  ?  
 you 're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth  !

 the apples are nt each  .  how many would you like  ?  
 let 's see  nt is about  .  .  .  almost a dollar us  .  what  ?   !  how about these pineapples  ?

 they 're imported from new zealand  .  four for nt  .  nine for a hundred  .  
ok  .  .  .  well  then how much is one jin  ?  
 ginseng comes in  different grades  .  it runs from  to  nt a jin  .  
  nt for ginseng  ?   !  do i have to buy a whole jin  ?  
 you can get a liang if you want  .  a liang is onesixteenth of a jin  .  that would be nt  .  
 whew  !  that sounds more like my price range  .  i 'll take two liangs  .  
 i 'll have my brother cut some for you  .  
 this little red fruit looks good  .  what 's it good for  ?  
 that 's a lucky fruit called hong zat  !  people say that if you eat them  you will have your first son very soon  !

 i know girls love this kind of car  .  look  it 's got a sunroof  !  imagine  .  .  .  a cool  starry night  .  .  .  
 so  you 're going to use sarah 's car to go cruising for chicks  ?  
yeah  but you guys do n't stay with the same classmates all day  right  ?

 i think so  .  i ca n't find it anywhere in my hotel room and i remember the last place i used it yesterday was in this department store  .  
 where exactly did you use your passport in the store  ?  
 in the shoe department  .  i had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler 's cheques  .  
 well  let me call the shoe department to see if they  ve found a passport  .  sorry  your passport has n't turned up there either  .  
 then what shall i do  ?  
 you can fill in this lost property report and i will keep my eye out for it  .  these kinds of things usually turn up eventually  but i suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation  so they can issue you a new passport in case it does n't show up  .  
 you are right  .  do you have a pen  ?  
 here you are  .  
yes  emergency  .  there is a huge fire here  .

 my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road  .  
can i see the doctor  ?  
 yes  do you have an appointment  ?  
 no  i do n't  .  
 well  .  the doctor does n't see nobody without an appointment  .  
 well  i am spending my vacation here and i have a stomachache and  .  .  .  
 oh  i see  .  maybe we can fit you in at   .  
 i  d prefer to see him asap  .  if i have to wait for another  mins  i think i will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and  .  .  .  
 oh  why did n't you say it 's an emergency  ?  here  fill out this form and take a seat  .  i 'll send you in next . you do n't have insurance  ?  
 no  not for this country  .  
 how about traveler 's insurance  ?  
 no  i did n't think i  d need it  .  
 can you pay cash  then  ?  
 cash  credit card  cheque anything  .  i just have to see a doctor  .  i am in pain  .  
 all right  all right  relax  .  i am only trying to do my job  .

 well  i seem to be a little bit lost here  .  i am worried that i  ll never find my way  .  what 's worse  .  i forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now  .  
 well  keep you chin up  !  i  ll try to help you  .  where are you going  ?  
 i am trying to get to the royal hotel  .  do you know where that is  ?  
 yes  no problem  .  you walk down this street  .  you turn left at the first intersection  .  walk along that road  turn right at the corner  .  after that  you make a lefthand turn at the first traffic light  .  the royal hotel is on your right side  .  
 great  .  are there any landmarks nearby  ?  
 yeah  i think so  .  i think the hotel is right across the street from a post office  .  it is as plain as the hump on a camel  .  you ca n't miss it  .  
 oh  that 's good  .  i should be able to find it pretty easily then  .  is that far from here  ?  
 yeah  it  s gonna take you a while if you go by foot  .  i  d say it 's about a   minute uphill walk  .  you have to be as strong as a lion to make it  .  
 oh  that will take too long and i am kind of in a hurry  .  can i take a bus there  ?  
 well  you could take a bus there  but you would have to transfer buses twice  .  a taxi would probably be a lot quicker  .  
 all right  .  i guess i 'll take a taxi then  .  how long will it take by taxi  ?  
 not too long  .  it should take about ten mins by taxi  .  
 cool  thanks  .  
look  jim  .  that man just fell down over there  .  
 we 'd better see if he is ok  .  
 sir  sir  are you all right  sir  ?

 oh  no  .  he is not breathing and there  s no pulse  .  call   .  
excuse me  sir  .  you ca n't park here  .  
 i am just waiting for my friends  .  it wo n't be long  .  
 sir  the curb here is not for parking  .  
 but i did n't see the sign  ma  am  .  
 there is a sign at the corner of the street  .  when you turned in here  you should have seen it  .  
 i did n't see it  .  
my watch always gains ten minutes a day  .  
 that 's funny  .  my watch always loses ten minutes a day  .  
 no kidding  .  
 i am serious  .  every morning i set my watch by the radio  but it still loses ten minutes  .  
 you know what you can do  ?  
 throw it away and buy a new one  .  
 no  you do n't have to  .  you only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day  .  
 so you put your watch back ten minutes every day  ?  
 yes  that 's what i am doing  .  
good afternoon  sir  .  please sit here  .  
 a haircut and a shave  please  .

 that 's true  .  here are some samples of hairstyles  .  what do you think about this one  ?  
 no  i do n't like short hair  .  i like this one  .  the wave looks beautiful  and it fits my age too  .

 well  you  re in luck  !  you see  if you sign up for our threeyear plan  we  ll throw in a handset for free  .

 i don  t like the pointed toes  .  let me take a look at what else you have  .  too high  .  that one looks like the back would cut into my heel  .  i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly  .  
 what size  ?  
 sevenandahalf  .  
 here we are  .  how does it fit  ?  
 hmmm . not good  .  they  re too tight . the length is right  but the shoe is too narrow and it  s pinching my toes  .  and there  d be no room for my insoles  .  you know what  ?  i don  t think i have the patience fo 
we have been over this a hundred times  !  we are not getting a pet  !

 who is going to look after a dog or a cat  ?  
 i will  !  i  ll feed it  bathe it and walk it every day  !  we can get a labrador or a german shepard  !  
 what if we want to take a vacation  ?  who will we leave it with  ?  plus  our apartment is too small for that breed of dog  .  
 ok  .  how about we get a cat or a ferret  ?  
 we  re planning on having children soon  i don  t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house  .  
 fine  !  let  s get a bird then  !  we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk  !  a parrot would be awesome  !  
 i  ll tell you what  i can get you some hamsters and we  ll take it from there  .  
smells good  !  what  s for breakfast  ?  
 well  since we are getting up so late  i decided to make a big breakfast  !  
 nice  !  brunch  !  
 kind of  so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs  some french toast and buttermilk pancakes  !  
 wow  !  you really went all out  !  did you make any coffee  ?  
 yeah  just the way you like it  !  i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light  .  
 looks good  !  i  ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice  .  
i  ve decided to grow my own garden  !  
 what  ?  you don  t know the first thing about gardening  !  
 on the contrary  i have been reading a lot of books about the subject  .  
 oh yeah  ?  tell me then  smarty pants  how will you go about setting up your garden  ?  
 well  first i need to buy some things  such as fertilizer  seeds and tools  .  
 what type of tools  ?  
 you know  the basics  .  a rake  shovel  spade and a hoe  .  
 right  .  well it seems like you have all your bases covered  .  what  s next  ?  
 i  ll till the soil and then sow the seeds  .  i  ll then add some fertilizer and voila  !  gardening all done  !  
good afternoon  ma  am  my name is mike and i am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals  .  
 no  thank you  i am not interested  .  
 please ma  am  if you could spare five minutes of your time  i am sure we could find something that interests you  !  
 i wish i could  but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me  .  
 we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking  !  this one for example  is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world  !  
 wow  that would be kind of useful  do you have any other cooking magazines  ?  
 sure do  !  this one is a quarterly publication  but each issue has over  color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas  !  
 wow  this is nice  !  ok  sign me up for both publications  .  
 you mentioned you have a dog  most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care  pet shops and even pet sitters  !

hey mel  !  are you up for some tennis today  ?  
 sorry  i can  t  !  i have to go to work  pick up jake and maddie from school  and make them an afternoon snack  then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class  .  
 you sound exhausted  .  maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out  !  she can pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool activities  .  she can also help you do some household chores  and run so 
 oh  i don  t know  .  .  .  it  s hard to find the right nanny  .  you have to consider her previous work experience  the responsibilities you give her  and how she interacts with the kids  .  i would love to have 
 i think you should definitely consider it  !  this way you won  t have to juggle such a busy schedule  and you  ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings  .  i can refer you this great 
how are you today  ?  
 great  thanks  .

 your appointment for friday at  pm has been confirmed  .

 i am the apartment manager  .  how can i help you  ?  
 i wanted to know if that apartment on main street is still for rent  .  
 i have n't rented it out yet  .  would you like to see it  ?  
 yes  i want to see it  .  
 how about today at  p  .  m  .   ?  
 that time is okay with me  .  
 very good  .  we 'll meet at   .  do you need directions  ?  
 no  thank you  .  i go by there on my way to work  .  
 if you 're interested  you can fill out an application form  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  do i need to bring anything myself  ?  
what are your thoughts on the apartment  ?  
 i think that it  s absolutely gorgeous  .  
 there aren  t any problems with the apartment  ?  
 i think that the apartment looks very nice  but i do see some problems  .  
 what problems  ?  
 i did notice a few stains in the carpet  .  
 we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in  .  
 you will  ?  
 yes  but other than that  are there any more problems  ?  
 that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment  .  
 i  m happy that you find this apartment so appealing  .  
what do you think about the apartment so far  ?  
 it is beautiful  .  
 you don  t have any problems with how it looks  ?  
 actually  there is a problem  .  
 like what  ?  
 there are some stains that were left in the carpet  .  
 those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in  .  
 oh  is that right  ?  
 yes  .  now what other problems do you have  ?  
 that was the only problem that i saw  .  
 well  i  m glad that everything else is to your liking  .  
how are you doing  ?  
 everything  s fine with me  .  
 what can i do for you today  ?  
 is it possible for me to view the apartment today  ?  
 unfortunately  you will not be able to view it today  .  
 why can  t i view it today  ?  
 you  ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment  .  
 i understand  .  may i make an appointment then  ?  
 how does this friday sound  ?  
 friday at  pm  .  would be perfect  .  
 that will be fine  .  
do you like the apartment  ?  
 i absolutely love the apartment  .  
 everything is okay  ?  
 i do have one problem with the apartment  .  
 what  s the problem  ?  
 i don  t like all those stains in the carpet  .  
 we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment  .  
 i did not know that  .  
 i assure you that we will  and if there are any more problems  feel free to tell me  .  
 that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment  .  
 i  m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice  .  
i would love to rent out your apartment  .  
 that  s great  .  
 how much is the rent  ?  
 the rent each month is    .  
 that  s a lot of money  .  
 did you have a better price in mind  ?  
 what about    ?  
 that  s way too low  .  
 i can  t pay much more than that  .  
 how about   a month  ?  
 that would be fine  .  
i heard that you finished my home inspection  and i was wondering how it went  .  
 first of all  we need to understand what i was looking for  .  do you know what the purpose of an inspection is  ?  
 i am not sure what a home inspection is all about  .  
 i went there to check for problems with the home  so you aren  t surprised when you move in  .  
 wouldn  t the owners have told me about any problems  ?  
 sellers aren  t always truthful  and there might also be problems that they aren  t aware of  .  
 can i require the owners to fix the problems  ?  
 you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems  .  
 what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home  ?  
what would be the earliest that i could actually move into my new house  ?  
 the keys will be turned in on tuesday night  .  the house will be yours at that time  .  
 what should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on  ?  
 you can tell the utility company what day you are moving in  and they will transfer the utilities to your name  .  
 there are a few things that we want to do to the place  like painting and carpet cleaning  .  
 take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint  .  it will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived  .  
 i asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in  .  
 that will be good  .  you are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away  .  
 i could use some help on moving day  .  what are you doing on saturday  ?  
are you ready for your first driving lesson  ?  
 yes  .  which one is the brake again  ?  
 the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas  .  
 i  m glad this car is an automatic  .  i do n't like having to change gears  .  
 automatics are very simple to drive  .  the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on  .  
 you should also put yours on  .  you never know what will happen with me in the driver  s seat  !  
 very funny  .  next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror  .  can you see out of them  ?  
 i can  t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car  .  could you move it forward a bit  please  ?  
 how  s that  ?  
 that  s better  .  now what  ?  
 check your petrol situation  .  
 the tank is almost empty  .  i guess i  ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up  .  
 that  s a good idea  .  put your keys in the ignition  start it up  put the car in reserve  wait for the road to be clear  and then back out of the driveway  .  
 i got it  .  don  t worry  .  i  ll get you there in one piece  .  
 remember  no honking this time  .  the horn is only for emergencies  !  
hoo  i 'm getting tired  jeanine  been a long day  .  
 i 'm not quitting yet  .  you know my favourite slogan  do n't you  ?  
 yeah  i know  .  shop till you drop  .  
 right  !  
 i 'm getting a little short on cash  .  let 's just window shop a little  .  
 ok  .  
 hey  jeanine  get a load of that  .  it 's beautiful  .  
 ahahah  and i thought you were tired  .  
 you know  .  .  i have a weakness for long dresses  .  
 it sure looks special  looks expensive too  .  
 sure does  .  hey  can i sponge a little cash of you  ?  
 do n't worry  marian  i 've got you covered  .  
hello  do you remember me  ?  i bought some vases from you yesterday  .  
 yes  you sent them to new york  right  ?  
 that 's right  .  i thought i 'd come back to buy some more souvenirs  .  
 what did you in mind  ?  
 well  first  i 'd like to buy a few postcards  .  my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere  .  i want to do that  too  .  
 we have plenty of postcards to choose from here  .  the same designs can be found on these posters  .  
 posters are difficult to travel with  .  i think i 'll just buy the postcards  .  i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice  .  
 yes  we do  .  they 're on the wall behind you  .  
 how much do they cost  ?  
 the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask  .  would you like me to get one down for you to look at  ?  
 yes  i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle  .  
 here you go  .  
 i 'll take it  i 'd also like to buy some chocolate  .  
 are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift  .  
 yes  it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate  .  
 we 've got plenty to choose from here  .  
come on  let 's go for lunch  gregory  .  
 i was going to eat in  i 'm short on cash  .  
 do n't worry about it . it s on me  .  
 in that case  i 'm with you  .  em . this is good  .  
 i agreed  hi  guess what  ?  i went bungee jumping last weekend  .  
 are you on the up and up  ?  
 definitely  .  you know  i 'm into serious sport in a big way  .  
 if you asked me  you 've got a screw loose somewhere  .  
 come off it  it 's not that serious  .  you should diy  do it yourself  sometime  .  
 fat chance  i 'm too scared of bungee jumping  .  
 no  really  i think you 'd like it  .  i adapted to it right off the bat  .  
 what did that have to do with me  ?  i 'm not the selfseeker like you  .  
 i can teach you how  .  
 i had a sneaking suspicion about you  eric  i think you 've lost it  .  
hi  nally  are you hungry  ?  
 i 'm starving  .  let 's go grab a bite  .  
 where to  ?  
 how about karlis  ?  
 are you kidding  ?  that place is too ritzy for lunch  .  
 true  .  ok let 's go to grumose  ?  
 same thing  meals there all coarsen arm and leg  .  
 i guess it is a little pricy  .  
 let 's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch  .  .  
 that will be ok  .  come on  i ca n't wait to chow down  .  
 that was a great lunch  the food was good  but the service was lousy  .  
 is that why you stiffed the waiter  ?  
wow  amy  look at that number  .  
 what 's so great about it  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  it 's a scrim  .  
 not to me  i would n't be caught dead in that  .  
 i love that kind of stuff  .  
 yeah  you seem to like those styles  .  
 sure do  .  i get a kick out of looking punk  .  
 this one looks really expensive though  .  
 i do n't care how much it costs  .  i 'm rolling in it  .  
 lucky you  !  i ca n't buy anything else  .  i 'm flat broke  .  
 i got a replace my party outfit  i trashed it last week  .  
 why did you drag me into this  ?  i 've spent a week salary  .  
 are you on the level  ?  you 're the one who called me  remember  ?  
excuse me  could you tell me which line i  m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package  ?  
 you can buy the bubble wrap here  but you  ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage  .  
 that  s a really long line  .  how long do you think it  ll take to get through all those people  ?  
 it takes about  minutes per person  so it  ll probably be about an hour  s wait  .  
 can i buy stamps here  ?  
 sure  .  how many would you like  ?  
 i need  for my christmas cards  .  
 are you sending them abroad  ?  
 twenty of them are going abroad to china and america  .  
 do you have any going anywhere in the eu  ?  if you do  those are less expensive  .  
 no  .  
 ok  here you go  .  that will be  pounds and seventy two pence  .  
 and the bubble wrap  ?  
 that  s another quid  .  
how can i help you  ?  
 i 'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend  .  
 do you know what kind of scent she usually wears  ?  
 she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no  .    .  but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance  .  
 ok  here are some of our most popular perfumes  .  
 which one would you recommend  ?  
 personally  i quite like the new perfume by clinique  .  it 's a subtle flowery scent  .  what do you think  ?  
 that smells great  .  i 'll take one bottle  please  .  
 would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend  ?  we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers  .  
 it 's ok  .  she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder  and i would n't know what shade to buy  .  
 how about some lipstick  ?  every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick  .  
 she does n't usually wear lipstick  .  she thinks it makes her nose look too big  .  
 how about some mascara  ?  that will make her eyes look bigger  .  
 no thank you  .  she has big enough eyes as it is  .  
 i know what she would likesome whitening cream  .  
 no thanks  .  western women usually try to make their skin darker  no lighter  .  
 will that be all then  ?  
we really were lucky  .  we got the last available table for twoand we did n't even have a reservation  !  did you see the long lines behind us  ?  
 yeah  i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long  .  i 'm starving  !  
 let 's take a look at the menu so we can order  .  do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share  ?  
 what would you rather have  samosas or poppadoms  ?  
 i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa  .  
 well  let 's get a plate of those then  .  
 sounds good  .  what are you going to have for your main course  ?  
 i think i might have a dahl  .  
 what 's in a dahl  ?  
 it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice  .  
 that sounds nice  .  do you want to share some kebabs as well  ?  
 ok  .  how about some lamb kebabs  ?  
 that 's my favourite  .  do you want to have some wine or beer  ?  
 i think i 'll have a beer  .  
 ok  shall i flag down the waitress  ?  
 i would n't recommend it  .  i think we should wait until she comes round  .  
 you 're right  .  that might seem a bit rude  .  it 's a good thing i 've got you with me  !  
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit  ?  i 'm going to get one made for a friend 's wedding  .  
 sure  .  what kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from  ?  
 it depends on the price  but i was thinking of getting a wool  cashmere blend  .  
 that will probably be quite expensive  but the more you pay for the fabric  the longer it 'll last and the better it 'll look  .  what color do you want the suit to be  ?  
 i was thinking of a brown pinstriped suit  .  
 brown  huh  ?  is n't that a bit dull  ?  
 have n't you heard  ?  brown is the new black  .  
 why do n't you just get black  ?  black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything  a funeral  a wedding  a job interview  anything  !  
 that may be true  but black is so boring  .  anyway  i already have three black suits  .  i might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest  .  
 here are two different shades of brown  .  which one do you prefer  ?  
 i like the one on the left  but i do n't like the pattern on it  .  it 's too much  .  i want a pattern that 's a bit subtler  .  
 how about this one  ?  
 i think that will do  .  let 's go talk to the tailor about getting it made  .  
i feel like i 'm craving a salad  .  
 what kind do you want  ?  
 i have no idea  .  
 caesar salads are good  .  
 i like those too  .  
 what kind do you plan on making  ?  
 i 'd really like a salad with chicken  .  
 chicken salads are really good  .  
 i always make my salads with shredded cheese  croutons  and almonds  .  
 that sounds like a great salad  .  
 why do n't you put it in your salad  ?  
would you like to order now  ?  
 this all looks good  !  i think we know what we want  .  
 please let me point out the chef 's special  which is blackened catfish  .  
 i am dieting  so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce  ?  
 we are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs  .  
 could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian  ?  
 the cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice  .  
 i am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce  .  i would like the garlic sauce on the side  .  
 would you like your salad brought to you with your entree  or would you like it served now  ?  
have you washed any clothes yet  ?  
 no  i 've only washed my whites  .  
 when you wash your dark clothes  can you put some of mine in  ?  
 sure  .  is there any extra care that i should take with your clothes  ?  
 just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle  .  
 how many clothes of yours do you want me to wash  ?  
 there is n't a lot  why  do you have a large load to wash  ?  
 it 's really only a small load  .  
 do you mind washing my clothes  ?  
 not at all  .  it 's no problem  .  
 thank you so much  .  
did you already wash your clothes today  ?  
 i 've only washed my white clothes  .  
 could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours  ?  
 is there any special care i should take with your clothes  ?  
 the only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle  .  
 are there a lot of clothes  ?  
 there are n't a lot of clothes  do you have a lot to wash  ?  
 it 's a medium load  .  
 you do n't mind  do you  ?  
 no big deal  .  i 'll do it for you  .  
 okay  thanks a lot  .  
what does it cost to ride this bus  ?  
 the fare is   .   .  
 have you been driving buses a long time  ?  
 i have n't been driving for long  only for a few months  .  
 do you like to drive the bus  ?  
 not in the least bit  .  
 i would have never dreamed of ever becoming a bus driver  .  
 i never dreamed of doing this either  .  the only thing i like about it is the money  .

 what kind would you like  ?  
 what kind of internet is there  ?  
 you can get del or dialup  .  
 which of those two is best  ?  
 i would recommend del  .  
 so that one better  ?  
 it 's better because it does n't tie up the phone  .  
 what do you mean by that  ?  
 del is n't connected through your phone line  but dialup is  .  
 so then i ca n't use my phone if i 'm on the internet  ?  
have you finished washing clothes  ?  
 i 've finished my white clothes  .  i need to wash the rest  .  
 well  when you do your darks  can you wash some of mine too  ?  
 i can do that  .  is there a special way you want them washed  ?  
 they need to be washed on the gentle cycle  .  
 do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed  ?  
 there are n't many clothes  is your load big  ?

 maybe if you were a parrot  .  i would n't recommend it  .  
 how much does a mango cost  ?  
 normally  they 're   each  .  today  they 're only   each  .  
 maybe i wo n't like the taste  .  
 it 's hard to describe  .  they 're sweet  but also sort of citrusy  .  
 how do i tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one  ?  
 they 're similar to an avocado  .  when the outside feels soft  they 're ripe  .  
 where do most of them come from  ?  
where is the bus  ?  
 i think it 's running late  .  
 it should 've been here  minutes ago  .  
 it should be coming soon  .  
 it better  because i 'm already late for work  .  
 i ca n't stand riding the bus  .  
 me too  it 's so unreliable  .  
 that is true  .  
 it 's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather  .  
 exactly . that s the worst part  .  
 i think it 's time we started driving  .  
did you get your bus pass  ?  
 i have n't gone to get it yet  .  
 why have n't you got it  ?  
 i do n't know where to go to get one  .  
 i know where to get them from  .  
 where do i get it  ?  
 they sell them at the business office on campus  .  
 i had no idea  .  
 i 'm sure you did n't  .  
 thank you  .  
 do n't mention it  .  
i want to get on the bus already  .  
 it just is n't on time today  .  
 it was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago  .  
 i think it 'll be here pretty soon  .  
 i need to get to work  so it better  .  
 i really do hate public transportation  .  
 i agree  it 's just never on time  .  
 that 's right  .  
 i also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather  .  
 oh  that 's the worst  .  
 we need to get a car  .  
i need some flowers for my wife  .  it 's her birthday  .  
 very well  .  we have some fresh red roses  .  
 how much are the roses  ?  
   per dozen  .

 no  the roses will be fine  .

 we have a good variety  .  what decade would you like  ?  
 i was hoping i could find something made in the s  .  
 there are six on this table  .  
 i hope at least one of them has dancing figures  .  
 many people like the dancing figures  .  two of our boxes have the figures  .  
 so hard to choose  .  i think i 'll take this one  .  
 that one will bring you many hours of pleasure  .  
 does a warranty come with this music box  ?  
 i 'm sorry  but if it breaks down  you 're on your own  .  
 i just thought i would ask  .  
you look hot and tired  .  jack  have you been exercising  ?

 who won  ?  
 they did  .  
 what was the score  ?

 that  s not going to be all right  .  
 i don  t understand why  .  
 i  m going to have to keep your deposit 
 why can  t i have it back  ?  
 because you  re leaving before your lease is over  .  
 you have to give it back to me  .  
 you  re not going to get it  .  
 but i  m not able to live here anymore  .

 we still have more to go  i think  .  
 we 've been on this bus for a while now  .  
 you 're right  .  
 should we have gotten off the bus already  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  
 i thought you knew  .  
 maybe we did miss our stop  .  
 really  ?  
 i 'm positive that we missed our stop  .  
 i 'm never catching the bus with you again  .

i 'm searching for an old music box  .

mr  .   hello  mary  .  
 hi  .  
 mr  .   i 'm mr  .  taylor  and i 'm your counselor  .  i 'm going to show you around the school  .  
 ok  .  
 mr  .   right here is the cafeteria  .  
 it 's huge  !  
 mr  .   but not big enough  .  and here is our computer room  .  
 there must be about  computers in here  .  
 mr  .   and over here is our gymnasium  .  
 do i have to take gym  ?  
are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus  ?  
 yeah  .  look  other kids are coming this way  .  
 but it does n't look like a real bus stop  .  
 that 's because regular buses do n't stop here  .  
 how much is it going to cost  ?  
 nothing  .  it 's free  .  
 is that yellow bus it  ?  
mr  .   there are two things that you 'll need to know  .  
 what are they  ?  
 mr  .   the school has three lunch periods  and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch  .  
 wow  !  
 mr  .   furthermore  when you are dismissed in the afternoon  you will be divided into two waves  .  
 two waves  ?  
 mr  .   the school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time  .  so only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave 's students  .  
mr  .   are you mary lin  ?  
 yes  .  
 mr  .   i 'm mr  .  rogers  your homeroom teacher  .

 when does the first period begin  by the way  ?  
mary  this is your homeroom  .  it 's   .  remember that  .  
 what 's a homeroom  ?  
 you sit in there  listen to the morning announcement with other kids  and then you go to your classes  .  
 cindy  i 'm scared  .  
 but i have to go to my homeroom  .

 it was good  .  do you have a girlfriend at school  ?  
good morning  john  .  have you finished reading the novel by dickens borrowed from the library  ?  
 no  .  i caught a cold two days ago  .  i only finish reading half of it  .  
 i 'm sorry to hear that  .  how are you feeling now  ?  
 i 'm feeling better today  .  
 how many days do you plan to finish reading it  ?  
 about more three days  i think  .  
 ok  .  after three days  i will come to you for it  .  
you 'd better prepare for the examination  .  
 i do n't think the exam will be very hard  .  
 you should change your attitude  or you will not pass the course  .  
han maimed  what 's your plan for the weekend  ?  
 i plan to travel around harvard university and know more about it  .  to tell you the truth  i plan to apply for harvard after graduation from high school  .  it  s better to get to know it  .  what about you  ?  
 i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays  .  
 oh  my god  !  john  i didn  t know you are religious  .  you just look like a scientific kook  like leonard in the big bang theory  .  
 come on  han maimed  don  t make a fuss  .  a lot of americans  including many scientists  believe in religion  .  
 but i  m really surprised  .  i thought science and religion are not compatible  are they  ?  
 yes  they are compatible  .  actually  the u  .  s  .  is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world  .  
 i 've heard about it a little bit before  but i don  t understand  .  how can people believe in god since they know god does n't exist  ?  
 that  s a little complicated  .  you  ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u  .  s  .  history later on  .  religion was and is a part of american people  s life  .  guess what  ?  even harvard university  which is a highly academic institution  is in a sense the product of religion  .  
 really  ?  
 absolutely  !  it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england  .  
 why was it founded by the puritans  ?  where were the atheistic educators  ?  
 because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans  .  
 how come  ?  i mean why most of them were religious people  ?  
 that  s because in the th and th century  there was a series of religious reforms in england  .  many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries  .  
 so  you mean people did n't enjoy religious freedom in england  ?  
 yes  that 's why puritans moved to the new world  where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans  .  later on  it was these puritans who founded harvard college  .  
 why did they want to found a college  ?  
 many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england  .  they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well  .  
 oh  i see  .  
 actually harvard was first named new college  without a formal name  .  
 when did it begin to be called harvard university  ?  
 in   it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard  .  interestingly  johnharvard himself was a clergyman  .  
 it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion  .  
 therefore  it  s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion  there would note harvard  .  
 wow  i didn  t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history  .  
 religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u  .  s  .  
 i finally begin to get to know harvard  .  it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor  .  i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard  .  
 remember that harvard is a part of the united states  .  so you have to know the u  .  s  .  history and culture if you want to have indepth knowledge of harvard  .  the two are closely related  .  
 that  s right  .  i have a lot to learn from you  .  
hey jack  .  how were your classes this semester  ?  
 they were not too bad  .  i really liked my polisci class  .  
 would you consider it your favorite class  ?  
 i do n't know if i would call it my favorite  but it ranks up there  .  
 what class was your favorite then  ?  
 i took a business communication class last year and it was terrific  .  
did you ever take history   ?  
 yeah  .  last semester  .  
 who was the professor  ?  
 it was professor johnson  .  
 i have him this semester  .  what do you think about him  ?  
 he 's a terrible instructor and demands a lot  but fortunately  he 's an easy grader  .  
 what did you end up getting  ?  
 i got an a   .  sounds good  but none of my test scores were that high  so i do n't know how i got a decent grade  .  
 that 's probably because he grades on a curve  .  
 are you enjoying the class so far  ?  
 i hate it and i was about to withdrawal  .  but after hearing your experience  i think i will tough it out  .  
 yes  .  definitely stay in the class  .  you will get a better grade than your test scores  .  he does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot  .  
hi jackie  .  you do n't look too well  .  what 's going on  ?  
 it 's nothing  .  i 'm just a little stressed out  .  
 why  ?  what 's stressing you out  ?  
 school  .  since i was working part time  i had a difficult time keeping up with class  .  now that we have exams coming up  i 'm totally freaking out  .  
 the best thing to do is study as much as you can  .  i 'm sure you 'll do alright  .  
 i hope so  .  i guess i wo n't be sleeping for the next  days  .  that 's what it 'll take  .  
 i have to study for an exam too  .  why do n't we study together  .  we can encourage each other  .  
hi  !  dick  .  where are you going  ?  you 're in such a hurry  .  
 playground  .  we 're having sports for today 's outside class activities  .  all my classmates have already got there  .  
 what are you going to play  ?  
 some of us will play basketball and some volleyball  .  
it 's weekend again  i 'm glad i can arrange for my personal matters  .  
 what do you mean by that  ?  
 oh  that means i can do whatever i like without few interruptions  .  
 you 've been always active and versatile  .  it seems that you are interested in everything  .  
 oh  really  ?  i just have lots of hobbies in my spare time  such as going to the concert  painting  handwriting  reading novels and reading fashion magazines  .  what about yours  ?  
 i have fewer hobbies than yours  .  that 's why i find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting  .  
 oh  you ca n't think like that  .  we young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas  .  you like taking photos and going to photography shows  why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable  ?  
 that 's a good suggestion  .  it 's fine today  .  maybe i can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset  .  it must be fantastic  .  
 i quite agree with you  .  with our hobbies  our life can be more colorful and exciting  .  
 and i can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend  .  
hi  my name is lean  and i 'm from russia  .  
 nice to meet you  lean  .  my name is alike  .  i 'm from japan  .  
 to me english is a difficult language  .  
 a second language is always difficult  .  
 true  but english is harder than most  .  it 's a crazy language  .  
 a crazy language  ?  why do you say that  ?  
 one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings  .  
lucy  you  re back  .  how was your first day of school  ?  
 it was great  .  i had a really good time  .  
 what classes did you have  ?  
 well  i had english from  o 'clock to  o 'clock  art from  o 'clock to  o 'clock  and math from  o 'clock to  o 'clock  .  
 what do you think about the teachers  ?  
 to be honest  i liked all of them  except for the math teacher  .  though he must be quite young  he seem like an old person  .  he  s so boring  !  
 that  s too bad  .  how was your english teacher  ?  
 she was great  .  in today  s class  she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student  .  she told us not to arm for exams  and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing  .  
 where is she from  ?  
 she said that she  s from a small town in the middle of america  .  
 were you able to understand everything that she said  ?  
 not everything  but nearly  .  she speaks very clearly and doesn  t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her  .  
 she sounds like a good teacher  .  do you think you  ll pass her class  ?  
 yes  .  .  .  with flying colors  !  
 what does that mean  ?  
 it  s a new phrase that she taught us today  .  it means that i will not only pass the class  but i will do extremely well  !  
 if you like the class this much already  i  m sure you will  .  
 i hope so  .  
 did she give you any homework  ?  
 not today  .  she said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework  
who was the best teacher that you ever had  ?  
 that would have to be miss baymler  my fourth grade teacher  .  
 what was she like  ?  
 she was patient  kind  fun  smart  caring  and yet strict  too  .  i really learned a lot from her  .  
 what kind of things did you learn  ?  
 she taught us that you can do anything that you want to do  .  
 anything  ?  do you really believe that we can do anything  ?  
 if you really want to do something and you work hard at it  i believe you can do it  .  
 you said she was strict  .  did she have a lot of rules  ?  
 she had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable  .  for example  the students had to treat each other with respect  or they would be disciplined  .  
 i see  .  she sounds like she really cared about her students  .  
 yes  .  she treated us all fairly  .  she don  t have any teacher  s pets  .  
 really  ?  doesn  t every teacher have a teacher  s pet  ?  
 well  .  to be honest  i usually sucked up to teachers because i wanted them to give me good grades  .  however  miss baymler didn  t treat me any differently  .  she really didn  t have any teacher  s pets  .  
 do you know what she is doing now  ?  
 as a matter of fact  i do  .  after she taught our class  she got married and moved to another city  .  then  she started writing children  s book  .  
 have you ever read one of the books  ?  
 of course  !  both children and adults enjoy her books  .  
 why don  t you recommend one to me  ?  
well  you seem to enjoy speaking english  .  
 you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day  .  you 'll see  .  a few weeks 'study in the school will have a similar effect on you  .  
 i hope so  .  you see  at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent  .  i 'm awfully worried  i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect  .  
 oh  she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class  .  she does n't mind your making mistakes  though  .  
who 's that over here  ?  
 that 's the new teacher  .  
 what do you think of the teacher  ?  
 she 's very nice  .  
 what does she teach  ?  
 english  of course  .  
 is she your teacher  ?  
 yes . she teaches our class three times a week  .  
 can she speak chinese to her students  ?  
 not very much  .  
you 're just left school  have n't you  emily  ?  
 yes  i finished last friday  .  
 you sound relieved  .  
 well  yes  .  i do n't mind admitting that i am  .  i enjoyed school  but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams  .  
 well  what are you going to do now  ?  have you made any plans  ?  
 yes  i intend to go to university  .  that 'll be in september  .  but it all depends on my a level results  .  
 you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects  ?  
in my country  we go to school from  o 'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon  .  
 five days a week  too  ?  
 actually  five and a half  .  on saturday  we have classes only in the morning  .  
 gosh  !  
 that 's too much for us really  .  
 where are you going now  ?  
 i 'm going to try to find out where the school is located  .  
 when do you start school  ?  
 i 'm going to register right now  .  
hi  walter  !  
 hi  sterling  !  
 what do you think of our new teacher  ?  
 professor wood  ?  i think he 's a brilliant scientist  .  
 you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded  ?  
ms . green  are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the united states  or do they differ in various sections  ?  
 the system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the united states  .  
 do most students in the united states attend private schools or public schools  ?  
 most public schools in the united states are very good  and the majority of students attend the public schools  .

i do n't think the lecture is very interesting  .  
 the lecturer is dull  too  .  
 i feel he 's like a talking machine  .  
i wish you would not be so selfish  .  
 selfishness is one human beings instincts  .  it is very difficult to get it out root and branch  .  
 but you should at least consider your son's future  .  
tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery  .  
 he is really terrific  !  
peter is a bag lady now  .  
 that black sheep  .  it serves him right  .  
 he was so rich in the past  .  maybe he  s regretting his past mistakes now  .  
mark is parade his knowledge again  .

saying you want to kill yourself  you terrified me out of my wits  .  
 i was playing a joke on you  .  
 that  s too much  .  
the trouble is not that  .  it is that he may suddenly remember something i promised him a couple of weeks ago  out of a clear blue sky  .  then he complains that i have gone back on my words  .  
 does he do that with his dad  ?  i mean  does he complain things to his father  ?  
 he never does  and in fact  he seldom communicates with him  .

why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village  ?  
 i think a mountain village is splendid  !  
 i do n't agree with you  .  it 's too small to live  .  
 it has fresh air  and it is nicer than a big town  .  
 i disagree  a big town is more lively  .  
 but i like the small mountain village  .  the big town is noisy  .  how charming it is when walking along the hill  !  
what a terrible house  !  
 i 'm sick of it  too  .  
 the door bell does n't work  there 's no hot water  and the building is falling apart  .  
 it 's no use complaining  .  if we had got enough money  we could n't put up with it  and would have moved out  .  
don  t be worried  .  please sit down and take it easy  .  
 how could i feel easy  ?  i  m really pissed  .

hi  cindy  .  i thought i  d missed you  .  
 oh  i am very sorry  hans  .  thank you for waiting for me  .  you must have been here a long time already  .  
 it  s all right  .  
 i was caught in the heavy rain  or i would have come earlier  .  i am sorry i kept you waiting  .  
 i was in a comfortable place  so really  it  s no problem  .  i am happy to see you  .  did the rain hold you up long  ?  
 yes  .  when i came out of the subway  it was raining cats and dogs  .  and i forgot my umbrella  .  so i had to wait for the rain to let up  .  
mary seems depressed  .  what  s the matter  ?  
 she didn  t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day  s hard work  .  
hi  becky  what 's up  ?  
 not much  except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall  .  
 what 's the problem  ?  
 she loves to nitpick and criticizes everything that i do  .  i can never do anything right when she 's around  .  
 for example  ?  
 well  last week i invited her over to dinner  .  my husband and i had no problem with the food  but if you listened to her  then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  .  there 's just nothing can please her  .  
 no  i ca n't see that happening  .  i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen  .  
 it 's not just that  .  she also criticizes how we raise the kids  .  
 my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us  .  if it was n't disciplining them enough  then we were disciplining them too much  .  she also complained about the food we fed them  the schools we sent them too  and everything else under the sun  .  
 you said she used to  ?  how did you stop her  ?  
 we basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing  and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she 'd let us do our things  .  she understood  and now everything is a lot more peaceful  .  
come in  come in  !  
 hi  gary  what happened  ?  i was waiting for you at the theater  .  why didn  t you meet me there  ?  
 i thought we were supposed to meet here  .  
 don  t you know our movie starts at seven  ?  and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven  .  then it doesn  t make sense to meet at the apartment  .  
 i  m sorry  .  we must have misunderstood each other  .  
 why don  t you try to be clearer about your intentions  ?  
 you  re right  .  i am sorry  .  let  s go and watch the movie  .  
do you have to leave soon  ?  
 no  .  actually i can stay longer  .  dave called to say that there is a beautiful chinese girl who  s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty  .  
 oh  that  s better  .  so you don  t have to rush  .  
 yeah  .  you know what dave just said  ?  
 what  ?  
 he said i should put on something very nice  because this girl will be my next target  .  
 he knows you very well  .  
 he always makes fun of me  .  he always says things like that  .  you know the new coming teacher  a chinese canadian  .  he said she would really be my chance  .  
 i  m sure you have chances everywhere  .  you  re handsome  talkative  and got a sense of humor  .  you must be very popular  .  
sally  i  m tired of this western food  .  i really miss my mother  s sichuan cooking  .  
 i  m sure you do miss that type of cooking  .  but can  t you try to get used to western food  ?  
 i have tried  .  but americans like butter  bread  sugar  and cream too much  .  
 i suppose you  re right  lee  .  maybe that  s why so many westerners are overweight  .  
 it  s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs  do not take naps during the day  and yet they can be so heavy  .  
i  m sick of my job  i always have to work late at night  and the company keeps me working in the office  .  
 why don  t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy  being outside working during the day  ?  
 what do you suggest  ?  i can  t afford to quit my job until i get a new one  .

 i did n't think you would be interested  .  
 you ca n't be serious  .  how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her  ?  
 sorry  i did n't think it mattered  .  
david  why do n't you clean your room  ?  
 i am not in the mood  .  
 why are you feeling depress  ?  
 i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me  .  it 's a real letdown  .  
 i do n't think she would do such a thing  .  
 but she did and it made me disappointed  .  
 oh  cheer up  !  a girlfriend is not everything  .  
 but she means a lot to me  .  
 then forgive her mistake  .  
reciting texts really bores me to death  .  
 do you have to remember every text  ?  
what 's all this noise about  ?  
 they 're discussing whether they should replace miss smith  the music teacher  .  
 why  ?  
do you like playing tennis  ?  
 i do n't find it very exciting  .  
 maybe you have n't found the magic  .  
i 'm really sick of waiting for a bus  .  
 yeah . especially when you have something urgent to do  .  
 but a taxi costs too much  .  
i 'm tired of dancing  .  
 but to me it 's really enjoyable  .  
 maybe it 's because you always have pretty girls as your partners  .  
i find beijing opera is quite a bore  .  
 young people enjoy pop songs more  .  
 it 's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all  .  
what a boring film  !  
 the acting of the heroine is too artificial  .  
what a bother having to climb storeys home every day  .  
 but it 's also a sort of exercise and it 's good to your health  .  
 i do n't care  !  
i must admit i 'm not at all interested in math  .  
 i 'm sure you 'll soon begin to like it . it s such an interesting subject  .  
is there anything wrong with your food this evening  miss  ?  
 sorry to trouble you  .  but i do n't think this fish is fresh  .  it actually tastes a bit off  .  
 sorry  miss  .  i 'll place it immediately  can i get you another drink  or you wait  ?  
 no  please do n't do that  .  i 'd just like to return it  .  
 i 'm sorry  miss  but i 'm afraid we ca n't do that  .  you 'll order something else instead  .  i 'd love to suggest the steak  it 's the special today  and quite tasty  .  
 ok  then please bring me the steak mediunrare  thank you  .  
hey  ann  i am really sorry about last night  .  i should n't have said those things to you  .  
 i am sorry too  .  i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while  .  i should have told bob i was busy this weekend  .  
 do n't be silly  .  you guys should spend as much time together as you can  .  besides we can go to the beach anytime  .  
 thanks for understanding  .  
 well that 's what being friends is about  is n't it  ?  
 hey  what if the three of us go to the beach together  ?  besides  you and bob have n't seen each other for a while  .  i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers  .  
 nah  i would n't worry about that  .  but i do n't want to be the third wheel  .  you two should have some quiet time to yourselves  .  
 i know bob wo n't mind  .  you can bring a date  like that guy from the bar you keep talking about  .  
hi mary  how 's it going  ?  
 well  last night i had a big argument with ann  .  
 terrible  .  it must be something serious  .  you two are such close friends  .  
 now that i look back at it  it waws n't that big a deal  .  i should n't have lost my temper  .  
 really  ?  what happened  ?  
 it 's just we 've been planning to go the beach for a while  and we decided we could both make it this weekend  .  then out of nowhere she called me up  said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee 
 that 's pretty harsh  .  
 i know  but i was so upset  .  i mean  come on  !  does she have to do everything her boyfriend says  ?  
 you know she probably feels just as bad  .  
 well  i think i was being a little selfish myself  .  i know they do n't get to see each other very often  .  
 well  in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding  .  you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship  .  after all you can go to the beach anytime you want  .  
the dinner was really good  .  it knocked my socks off  .  
 that 's very kind of you to say so  .  let 's try some afterdinner wines  .  
 great  .  sweet wines are my favorite  .  they always make a great finish to a decisions meal  .  
 do you prefer brandy or ports  .  
 port  please  .  
 excellent choice  .  i love its smooth flavor  .  
 the port is exquisite  .  it must have spent years aging in barrels  .  am i right  ?  
 yes  .  you always have a good nose for wines  .  
 next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine  .  
 oh  what 's that  ?  
 it 's made from naturally frozen grapes  .  
 why not  ?  it sounds great  .  
 oh  here 's to your health  .  
 thanks  .  cheers  .  
we are going out for dinner tonight  .  are you coming  betty  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  i have to check my schedule  .  where are you going  ?  
 oh  jake made a reservation at friday 's  .  
 jack  ?  
 yes  the one with the r  d team  .  is that a problem  ?  
 i will never go out with him anymore  .  
 why did you say so  ?  
 last time when we had dinner at the smith 's  it was a horrible experience  .  he had no manners at all  !  
 oh  really  ?  
 he made a lot of noises while eating  .  he talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly  .  
 are you kidding me  ?  how could he behave like that  ?  
 it is true  .  everyone kept looking at him  .  it was so embarrassing as i was sitting right next to him  .  
 what a shame  !  did n't he realized that  ?  
 i have no idea  .  he seemed to enjoy the dinner very much  .  
 maybe he should really something about eating etiquette  .  
i can  t believe it  !  
 what  s wrong  ?  that was a great goal  .  
 yes  but i bet   dollars on the cougars  !  
 looks like you  re going to lose out on this game then  .  
 i can  t believe it  !  i thought the cougars were going to win for sure  .  
 what were the odds  ?  
  to   in favour of the cougars  !  
doris  i 'm glad you 're home  .  i 'm terrified  .  i do n't know what to do  !  
 what is it  ?  what happened  ?  
 i think someone is stalking me  .  
 no  it ca n't be  .  really  ?  who  ?  
 i do n't know  .  i saw him the first time tuesday  .  he was at the cafe  .  i noticed he was looking at me a lot  .  not just the usual looking  but staring . he just kept staring at me  .  he did n't stop  .  
 what did you do  ?  
 i did n't do anything  .  finally  he left . but then i saw him again today  .  outside the shoe store  .  near the cafe  .  i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's  .  but then he came in too  .  
 did he leave when you left  ?  
 yes  .  then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me  .  he was following me  .  
he followed me all the way home  !  
 that 's about five blocks  .  and around corners too . so he was definitely following you  .  
 yes  he was  .  i 'm not imagining it . finally  just when i got home  i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there  .  he did n't smile  .  he just stood there  .  it was so obvious . what should i do  ?  i 'm so scared  .  can i call the police  ?  
 actually  i do n't think you can call the police  .  not yet at least . he has n't done anything  .  and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again  then maybe you should call  .  
 why ca n't i call the police now  ?  he was definitely following me  !  
 of course you can call the police if you want  .  that 's not what i mean  .  i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything  .  
 i suppose  .  what can they do  ?  i do n't even know who he is  .  
 listen  carol  .  do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing  .  just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time  and if he follows you again  then i think we should go to the police . but for now  just try not to worry  .  
hi  bob  everything okay  ?  
 more or less  .  there 's just one thing bothering me  .  
 oh  ?  what 's that  ?  
 well  you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree  .  one of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy  .  
 what gift  ?  
 it 's an egyptian carpet  .  the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude  .  seeing what gift was  i was really uncomfortable  .  i mean it 's too expensive a gift 
 you refused the gift  ?  that 's terrible  .  
 i know  but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift  .  i explained to him why  but he seemed really upset about it  .  i think he might have taken it the wrong way  .  
 perhaps  .  he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade  .  
are you cold  ?  
 yes  a little  .  
 i wonder if we can change the temperature  .  
 i tried before  .  there are no buttons on the air conditioning  .  
 there must be buttons  .  how do they turn it on and off  ?  
 i think it is centrally controlled  .  they control it at the main desk  .  
 well  they have it too cold in here  .  i want to be warmer  .  i wo n't be able to sleep  .  
 i 'm going downstairs for more drinking water  .  i will ask them  .  
 what did they say about the air conditioning  ?  
 they said it is centrally controlled . all the rooms are the same  .  they ca n't change it  .  
 that 's stupid  .  how can i sleep in this  ?  
i tried to ask the bank teller why it changed  but she did n't speak english well enough . so i decided to go to the magazine shop  .  the one around the corner . and i bought an american newspaper  .  
 what happened  ?  
 it seems that yesterday the mexican government declared would n't pay back the loans it got from the world bank . the government declared a default on the loans  .  
 that 's serious  .  
 i know  .  the economy here is having serious problems . but because the government declared a default  the currency value went way down  .  
 so now mexican pesos are worth about half as much  .  
 yes  it 's an amazing drop  .  
 wow  .  i feel sorry for the mexicans  .  but it 's good for us  .  
 yes  it 's very good  .  we suddenly have twice as much money to spend here . our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here  !  is n't that strange  ?  
 yes  and you know what  ?  
 what  ?  
 i do n't really like this hotel that much . so tonight  now that we are so rich  tonight why do n't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town  ?  
well  how did you enjoy your seaside trip  ?  
 it was fun  i tell you  .  
 tell me about it  will you  ?  
 well  we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning  .  it was a magnificent sight  !  
 did you stop at the fall for some pictures  ?  
 sure  we would n't miss that for anything  .  after that  we took a short cut to the park  .  there was very little traffic  so we got there in less than an hour  .  
 you were lucky then  .  
 yeah  we spent the whole morning under the tall trees  .  we had our picnic there  too  .  
 what did you do after that  ?  
 we went for a swim in the sea  .  that was the biggest part of the day  .  just look at my nice tan  !  
 so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday  .  
are you ready  ?  
you must be pretty excited about your trip to europe  .  when is it that you are leaving  ?  
 in just three weeks  and i am excited  .  but there are still a few things i need to do before i go  .  
 like what  ?  
 like renewing my passport  going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while i 'm gone  .  
 you are not going to give it up  are you  ?  
 no way  .  i 'll never find another apartment around here  .  but i do n't like the idea of paying three months rent on an empty apartment  either  .  
 i do n't blame you  .  perhaps you could sublet it  .  
 yes  but whom to  ?  
 mmm  .  .  .  let me think  .  oh  i know just a person  .  an old colleague of mine  jim thomas  is coming here to do some research this summer  from june to august  .  
 that 's exactly when i 'll be away  .  it sounds ideal  as long as the landlord agrees  .  
 tell you what  i 'll be calling jim late this week anyway  so i 'll mention it to him then  .  
hello  bob  this is frank  .  
 i know  we 've met  .  
 i did n't know you knew frank  .  
i ca n't believe it  i had faith in bob and he let me down  .  
 i know what you mean  .  
 really  ?  
get changed  !  
ben  what are you doing  ?  
 well  i would say that i  m just drifting   here  in the pool  .  
 why  ?  
 well  it  s very comfortable just to drift here  .  
 have you thought about graduate school  ?  
 no  .  
 would you mind telling me then  what were those four years of college for  ?  what was the point of all that hard work  ?  
 you got me  .  
be quiet  will you  ?  
what food do you fancy  ?  
 i feel like something good to eat  .  
 how about going to joe 's restaurant  .  
hi  how is it going  ?  
 pretty good  sam  .  only the awful weather  you know  .  
 that  s right  .  i  ve never really liked it since i got here  .  
susan  ?  what brings you here today  ?  
 well  i  ve got some papers due  .  
 really  ?  so what  s the news  ?  
i 'm feeling down  .  
where 's bob  ?  
 it seems like he 's not coming  .  
 can you give him a call on his mobile  ?  
i 'm so angry at bob for buying a new bike  .  
what day is it today  ?  
i 've just had an argument with bob  .  
 really  who started the argument  ?  
 he did and it 's his entire fault  .  
what are you doing this weekend  ?  
you said you like classical music very much  .  then who is your favorite opera star  ?  
 there are three of them  the three tenors  .  
 oh  you mean pavarotti  domingo and carreras  .  have you been to their live shows  ?  
 yeah  it 's really a unique experience  .  it 's a solo concert by pavarotti  .  he put on the performance in the forbidden city in beijing  .  
 i 've heard of that one  .  it was also his swan song  .  
 besides  speaking of classical music  we should never forget about the new year 's concert  .  
 of course not  .  people all over the world watch it on tv  or listen to it on the radio  .  
 sure  .  it 's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events  .  have you ever been to the live show  ?  
 yes  i went to the new year 's concert in   .  
 wow  you are so lucky  .  i saw that one on tv  .  but it must be so different to be there in the concert hall  .  
 that 's for sure  .  you know  it 's really amazing to be in the best concert hall  listening to the performance by the best orchestra  .  i had the greatest time ever  .  
 who was the conductor at that event  ?  
 lorin maazel  .  he did an amazing job  .  moreover  he just celebrated his th birthday  .  
 so cool  .  i wish i can go to the live new year 's concert someday in the future  .  
 the right opportunity for you would come along soon  .  you know  music is transnational  .  
are you free tonight  ?  
did you hear about bob and mary  ?  
 no  what happened  ?  
 they had an argument and split up  .  
can you recommend a resort to me  ?  
 what about the yellowstone national park  ?  
 have you ever been there  ?  
 yes  .  the scenery is so breathtaking  .  
 what is especially impressive  ?  
 there are thousands of hot springs and fountains  .  the park is known for them  .  
 is there a waterfall  ?  
 yes  .  the wellknown yellowstone waterfall is formed when the yellowstone lake falls down into the yellowstone canyon  .  
 what an attractive place  !  how can i get there  ?  
how did you do that  ?  
do you have change for a hundred  ?  
see you later  alligator  .  
i 'm back  .  
 what have you done  ?  
 going shopping  .  it tires me too much  .  
 why do n't you go shopping online  ?  
 can i  ?  
 why not  ?  let me recommend a website  .  
 ok  .  what does it sell  ?  
 it sells almost everything you can see in the department  .  
where are you going  ?  
 i 'm going to buy a cd  .  
 why not listen to music online  ?  
 then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line  is n't it  ?  
 you can audition music on line  and you can audition it off line after downloading it  so you need n't pay for it  .  
 i have downloaded one  but it still ca n't be listened  .  
 in order to listen to music  you must have the necessary software  .  
 can you recommend some to me  ?  
 certainly  .  realplayer is a good  .  
 can i download it  ?  
 yes  but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it  .  
do you have any particular hobbies  tom  ?  
 oh  yes  .  i love playing badminton  table tennis and computer games  .  and playing the games has become my favorite  .  
 i hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers  .  and they do n't care about their own health at all  .  how about you  ?  
 i 'm no better than them  .  they say it 's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time  but i think it 's stimulating  .  
 you wo n't play online games full of violence  will you  ?  
 once in a while  .  
 it 's no good  .  and i think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time  .  you might as well do something healthy and meaningful  .  
come on in  .  make yourself at home  .  
do you have a minute  ?  
bye  .  take care  .  
i heard betty lost her tennis match this morning  so she 's out of the tournament  .  
 really  ?  what a shame  !  i thought she was going to win this one  .  
it seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic  .  
i 'll participate in a quiz about the th olympic games in beijing  .  it will be held tonight  .  will you come  ?  
 sure  .  what do you know about the olympic games on the past  ?  for example  do you know where and when the first olympic games were held in the ancient times  ?  
 it was held in  b  .  c  .  at olympia  .  it also has a long history of more than  years  .  
 have n't the olympics been stopped for a long time  ?  
 yes  there were no games in    and   because of world war i and world war ii  .  
 i see  .  look  do you know what that emblem means  ?  i 've seen it so many times  but i do n't know what it stands for  .  
 oh  it 's the beijing  olympics emblem  .  it 's a chinese seal  meaning that chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world  .  
 i see  .  i believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to beijing to watch the games  .  
my husband goes out drinking with his friends every night  .  i 'm fed up with it  .  
how do you feel about teaching my friend how to read  ?  
 how old is your friend and why does n't he know how to read  ?  
 he 's  and he 's a new emigrant from south america and he 's never been to school  .  
 does he even know how to speak english  ?  
 no  .  but i thought that you could start with reading and then go from there  .  
 that was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me  .  
 come on  .  you 're great at teaching and i know you will love him  .  he 's adorable  !  
how annoying  !  
 what 's the matter  ?  
 every time i try to start this program  the computer freezes  .  
as we know  mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives  .  
 it bears a great many of advantages  but also some weak points  .  
 is it  ?  i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone  .  
 for instance  the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study  .  
 that 's true  .  some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones  .  
i 'm too tired now  .  i 've already worked for  hours overtime  !  
 god  !  do n't you think they should get you an assistant  ?  
 yes  they were supposed to  but so far nobody 's turned up  and i have to do the work alone  .  this is the first break i 've had all day  .  
 they 're really running you into the ground  .  why do n't you ask for some time off  ?  you could take a long weekend and have a good rest  .  
 i 'm afraid i ca n't before i finish this project  .  
 you 'd better pay more attention to your health  .  
 i will  thanks for your concern  .  
well  no one could survive without water  but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking  .  
 yeah  .  water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues  .  
 but what are the sources of water pollution  ?  
 they could generally be divided into two categories 
 well  direct ones are the pollution directly from factories  refineries waste treatment plants etc  .   aren  t they  ?  
 yeah  .  they are emitted directly into urban water supplies  .  
 but what about the indirect ones  ?  
 indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater  .  
 i see  .  for the sake of us all  we should be an active participator in the prevention of it  .  
i 'm tired  .  
 well  you 've been working on this assignment for five hours  .  
i could get along fine without all the office politics  .  
 what 's going on  ?  
 there is a position i 've had my eye on for several months now and i had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking  .  
 so what happened  ?  
 we were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so ay new employees  .  
 so what does that have to do with this position  ?  
 someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the management position i wanted  .  
julia  what do you think of the network  ?  
 network is omnipresent nowadays  .  it 's quite convenient for people  .  you see  we can download music and information from the internet  i can study from it  too  .  and the most of all  we can compose  send  and receive emails  .  
 yeah  you are right  .  internet makes our lives easier  .  but it 's a twoblade sword  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i mean internet brings benefit a lot  but also some disadvantages  .  for example  many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study  or some bad guys steal people 's money online  etc  .  
 i agree  .  but i think although it has some negative effects  on the whole internet does more good to us than harm  .  
hi  mr  .  wang  .  do you feel like going boating with me  ?  
 sounds interesting  i have n't gone boating for some time now  and what time  ?  
 how about tomorrow afternoon  ?  
 sure  .  where shall i meet you  ?  
 at the gate of the park  .  
 great  .  i look forward to meeting you  .  
 see you then  .  
hey  .  steven  .  you have a large chunk of money  but why do you still live in the old flat  instead of buying a new villa  ?  
 i like to live here and enjoy my neighbors company  .  and i do n't think i should waste money just because i have much of it  .  
 but i found you always hate to part with your money  .  look at the car you drive  it 's such a junker  !  
 oh  the car is old but still in good condition  .  i just think we should be thrifty  whether you are rich or not  .  
 but  .  .  .  but  .  .  .  
 but what  ?  just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue  but also a great revenue  .  
good afternoon  !  
 hi  how are you doing  ?  
 fine  thanks  .  i am wang lin  .  
 glad to meet you  wang lin  .  i am mary  .  
 is this your first time in beijing  ?  
 yes  .  my company has an office here  and i have just been transferred  .  
 here is my phone number  .  if you need anyone to show you around  call me  .  
what was the movie you saw last night  ?  
 it was a foreign film called gone with the wind  .  
 really  ?  i 've seen that movie  too  .  
 how did you like the movie  ?  
 i thought it was pretty good  .  
 i ca n't say i agree  .  
 you 're kidding  .  the storyline and acting were outstanding  .  
 i guess i expected too much from the movie  so i was a bit disappointed  .  
i want to improve my handwriting  and i 've practiced it for several weeks  but nothing happened  .  you see  my handwriting is still bad  .  
 oh  come on  .  you know it 's a long process  you have to be patient  .  
 i know it  but i do n't know when i can make it better  .  
 a  whatever you do  the most important is perseverance  .  so you have to hang on there  the longer  the better  .  then some day  you will find you 've already made a lot of progress  .  
 yeah  you are right  .  i must stop complaining and stick to it every day  .  
will you have time this saturday evening to go to the cinema with me  ?  
 saturday  ?  oh  i have a previous engagement  .  
 what a pity  !  then how about sunday  ?  
 i 've already got plans  too  .  
 then when do you think we could go out together  ?  
 how about friday  ?  only in that day can i arrange it  .  
 ok  .  any time on friday will be ok with me  .  
hello  !  
 is that the boxoffice  ?  
 yes  .  
 i 'd like to book two tickets for the film jane eyre for this evening  please  .  
 just a minute please  .  oh  i 'm sorry  all the tickets for tonight have been sold out  .  
 what a pity  !  how about tomorrow evening  ?  
 oh  you 're lucky  there are just two tickets left  .  do you want to take them  ?  
 wonderful  i 'll take them  .  
 ok  your name and telephone number please  .  
 wang min  .  telephone number is   .  can i pick the tickets this afternoon  ?  
 yes  of course  .  
oh gush  !  the first day of my career is over  .  i can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents  .  but i heard the notice that our company will hold twoweek staff training  .  
 stop fussing  !  it is said that the training is important for our newcomers  .  and my company also informs me to attend the training next week  .  
 but for me  the training is waste of my precious time  .  
it 's quiet everywhere in winter  .  
 yes  .  i like winter  .  
 me too  .  
 it 's snowing heavily  .  what about taking a walk  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  let 's go  !  
 what a heavy snow  !  look  !  the water is frozen  .  
 take care  !  do n't slip on the ground  .  
 i 've got it  .  i like the feeling of stepping on the ice  .  
 yes  .  very wonderful  .  
 there is a snowman over there  .  
i 'm sure he was offside  .  
 but the ref did n't whistle  .  
 i think he favors the host team  .  
hey  .  owen  !  have you gone on your family vacation yet  ?  
 oh  yes  .  i got so tired  .  my son began to cry the moment we got on the train  .  it was very embarrassing because we took the overnight train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep  .  
 did n't you bring his favorite toy  ?  
 yes  we did  .  fortunately we put his teddy bear in the bag  and finally he fell asleep at midnight with it in his arms  .  
 where did you go  ?  you 've got a beautiful tan  .  
 my wife did n't like to go to amusement parks  so we compromised and finally went to the seaside  .  i think vacation in summer is not good  .  
 you must have had a great time  .  most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming  .  
 yes  he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten  .  
 his friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir  .  
which team has won  ?  
 neither  .  the game ended in two all  .  
 but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized  .  
i like the kid  .  he 's so lovely  .  
 how old is he  ?  
in spring  people are feeling refreshed  .  they take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps  .  they feel they are full of spirits and energy  .  
 women in particular  .  they are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress  .  
 well  when summer comes  the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen  the sun is blazing and the air is threatening  .  no one would like to stay in the open air for long  .  
 that 's true  .  in summer  the first place people want to go is a spacious room with airconditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool  .  
 i myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects  especially the singing of cicadas  .  
 in autumn  almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested  .  
 and you can hear singing and laughing everywhere  !  people are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity  !  
 well  winter is a season for relaxation  do you agree with me  ?  
 well  it 's hard to say  .  for the fields and rivers  winter is a relaxing season  but for farmers  i think they might take a rest physically  but mentally they are still busy thinking  planning and calculating for the working of the next year  .  
what are your hobbies  mr  .  green  ?  
 i like collecting stamps  .  
 but it 's an expensive hobby  is n't it  ?  
 yes  you 're right  .  what do you like to do in your spare time  ?  
 i usually play chess with my friends  .  but i like playing basketball best  .  
 do you play basketball well  ?  
 no  i 'm not very good at it  .  i play just for the fun of it  .  
 shall we have a game together some day  ?  
hey  mary  what 's up  ?  
 just so so  .  last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time  so we decided to meet again tonight  .  
 oh  that 's exciting  .  what does this guy look like  ?  is he hot  ?  
 well  i did n't think so at first  .  but as we started talking  i found him extremely funny and witty  .  i could n't stop laughing at his jokes  !  and we have so much in common  .  we like the same team  music  and most amazingly  we both love chinese food  !  i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends  .  
 it seems you two are a good match  .  what qualities do you look for in a friend  ?  
 there 's nothing definite i think  .  i do n't have a list or anything  but when i first meet somebody  i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend  .  it seems i have radar helping me spot new friends  .  
 well  that 's something i 've never heard of  .  but if you ask me what i value most in a friend  i would say honesty  .  
 i agree  .  you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person  .  those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need  .  
what do you like to do in your spare time  ?  
 i am a girl of many interests  .  i like dance  chess  collecting stamps  travelling and taking photos  .  
 what kind of dance do you like  ?  
 i like rumba and tango  .  
 great  .  i am not interested in chinese chess  .  it is too difficult for me  .  
 you can learn chinese checkers or military chess  .  both of them are much easier  .  
 ok  i will try  .  as for stamp  do n't you think it is an expensive hobby  ?  
 yes  it is  .  but it is full of fun and knowledge  .  what about you  what do you like to do as hobby  ?  
 i like gardening  .  i take care of them everyday  .  i like those flowers and the swing in my garden  .  if the weather is nice  i would like to lie on the lawn  .  
mary  how was your date with john  ?  
 it 's ok  .  it seems we have a lot in common  .  
 oh  really  ?  that is great news  .  what does he look like  ?  
 he is tall and slim  fairhaired  .  
 sounds like he is pretty cute  .  what do you think of him  ?  
 he is a nice guy and very considerate  .  i am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor  .  
 oh  it 's love at first sight  .  when will you see each other again  ?  
 he did n't say  but he said he would call me  .  
 maybe he is busy with his work  .  just wait and try not to think about it too much  !  
 oh  david  .  stop it  !  i am a bit nervous  !  what should i do if he does n't call me  ?  
 come on  mary  you 're a total catch  .  i bet he will call you  .  do n't worry  .  
 thank you  david  .  you 're always so encouraging  .  
happy birthday  ann  .  many happy returns of the day  !  here is a present for you  .  
 thank you  peter  .  come into the dining room  .  we are going to cut the cake soon  .  
 ok  who is that girl  ?  
 that 's cathy  .  she is pretty  is n't she  ?  she likes dancing  .  ask her to dance  .  
 well  i do n't know  .  
 do n't be afraid  .  she is n't going to bite you  .  
donna  you really shocked everyone at the party last night  !  
 you mean with my performance  ?  
 yes  !  we have all assumed that you were the quiet  shy type  .  
 i guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve  .  
 where did you learn to sing like that  ?  
 i was part of a band in school  .  
 you  ?  wow  .  and why do n't you ever dress like that at work  ?  
hi  jim and wendy  .  where 're you going  ?  
that is the most beautiful sunset  !  
 let 's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute  .  
 here is a good place  .  let 's get out  .  
 wow  .  we do n't get to see this in the city  !  
 mother nature is quite an artist  .  
 look behind us at the mountains  !  they 're reflecting pink  !  
 amazing  .  the sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere  !  
are you free tomorrow  sam  ?  
 yeah  what 's up  ?  
what do you think of this suit  ?  do i look good or what  ?  
 you look great  !  however  i think you are a little over dressed for dinner  .  
 did n't they say we 're going to the ritz  ?  
 yes  but not the ritz carlton  the  ritz  is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor  .  
 in that case  let me make a quick change into my street clothes  .  
 i 'll wait right here for you superman  .  
 ta da  !  let 's go to the ritz  !  
hey sarah  .  why are you limping  ?  
 oh  .  hi matt  .  i went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches  .  
 was it your first time  ?  
 yeah  .  and i never want to go again  .  
 i remember the first time i went  .  my back was sore  i could n't sit down because it hurt my butt  and my legs would cramp if i walked too fast  .  
 that 's exactly how i feel now  .  
 it 's only like that the first couple of times  .  
 ha  .  there wo n't be a next time  .  
 you gotta give it a chance  .  it 's fun after awhile  .  
did you hear what happened to mike in accounts  ?  
 no  .  what  ?  
 he got arrested on friday night and spent the night in jail  .  
 no  .  really  what happened  ?  
 well  it was all a big mistake  actually  .  he got home on friday night really late  and apparently he 'd been out drinking with some clients  so he was really drunk  .  
 was he out with the guys from the bank  ?  
 yes  i think so  .  
 oh  yeah  they always get really drunk  .  
 well  anyway  he 'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys  so he could n't get in  .  he lives alone  you know  .  
 oh  really  .  i thought he lived with his wife  .  
 no  she left him last year  .  
 oh  really  ?  do you know why  ?  
 hang on  let me finish telling you what happened  .  where was i  ?  
 he lost his wallet and keys  .  
 oh yes  well  he tried to climb in through the bathroom window  but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot  .  the neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress  so they called the police  .  
 oh  no  .  
 yes  .  so when the cops arrived  they did n't believe his story 
 so then what happened  ?  
 well  when he sobered up  he called someone from work to come and bail him out  .  
 well  that 's a bit of a tricky situation  .  
what do you mean his grandmothers are already dead  ?  wait a minute  you do n't think he 's avoiding me  do you  ?  
 well you know  claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something  .  
 oh man  i hate rejection  .  it really makes you feel terrible  especially when you really liked the person  .  
hey jane  .  how are you doing these days  ?  
 hi martha  .  everything is perfect  .  
 are you enjoying married life  ?  
 it could n't be better  .  my husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much  .  
 you 're so lucky  .  i hope to get married to a guy like that  .  
 i 'm so happy  .  even though we are both working  we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends  .  
 do you guys do anything special  ?  
 in the evening  we just sit and talk over dinner  .  but on the weekend  we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant  or go to a nice cafe  .  
what about you  emily  ?  have you dated anyone recently  ?  
 i started to date someone recently  but it did n't work out  .  
 that 's too bad  .  what happened  ?  
i had a terrible journey back from bangkok last week  .  
 really  ?  why  ?  what happened  ?  
 well  first of all  the taxi that was taking me from the client 's office to the airport broke down on the freeway  .  
 oh  no  .  
 yes  and the driver did n't speak any english or chinese and he did n't have a phone on himcan you believe it  ?   and his radio did n't work  .  so there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi  .  
 so what did you do  ?  
 well  i actually thumbed a lift  .  
 you what  ?  
 yes  i stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out  and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport  .  
 wow  good for you  .  
 yes  except he drove really slowly  and i missed my flight  .  
 oh  no  !  
 yes  so i had to wait three hours for the next one  .  i did n't get home till four in the morning  and when i got home i realized i 'd left my house keys in my hotel in bangkok  .  
 you really have bad luck  do n't you  ?  
so kevin  what is your type  ?  
 i like girls who like to have fun  and are n't too serious  .  
 i agree  .  i like guys that can make me laugh  .  
what 's the time now  ?  
 sorry  i do n't know  there 's something wrong with my watch  .  
 you 've simply forgotten to wind it up  have you  ?  when do you usually wind it up  ?  
 in the coming  before going to work  .  
 you got up so late today  .  you have  i think  .  turn on the tv and set your watch by it  .  
 ok  .  i 'll turn it on  .  
 all right  .  it 's just four o 'clock  .  
 well  i 'm setting my watch at four  .  thank you  .  
do you want to hear a funny joke  ?  
 ok  .  are you sure it 's funny  though  ?  
 well  you 'll see  .  
 ok  .  
 ok  an englishman  a scotsman  and an irishman were going on a trip across the desert  and they could only take one thing with them  .  
 i see  .  
 so they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment  .  
 oh  that 's funny  !  
 hang on  i have n't finished yet  .  
 oh  sorry  .  
 well  as i was saying  they showed each other what they had decided to bring  .  the englishman had brought some water  .   if we get thirsty  we 'll have something to drink   he said  .  the scotsman brought a map  .   if we get lost  we 'll be able to find our way  .   the irishman had brought a car door  .  
 a car door  ?  you mean just one car door  ?  
 yep  .  a car door  .   why the door  ?   the others asked him  .   well   he said   if it gets hot  we can open the window  .   do you get it  ?  
wow  american football is more exciting than i thought  .  
 you  re in america now  my british friend  .  we just call it football  .  
 oh  right  .  so  i can  t quite follow what  s going on  .  .  .  who  s winning  ?  
 the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked  but the redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone  .  
 wow  !  what a hit  !  
 yeah  he tackled him so hard his helmet came off  .  
 is he ok  ?  
 it looks like it  he  s getting up  .  
 i guess he hit him too hard  the referee just called a penalty on the home team  .  
 the giants  ?  
 yeah  .  
 well  here we go again  .  
 what happened  ?  why did everyone get so quiet  ?  
hey john  nice skates  .  are they new  ?  
 yeah  i just got them  .  i started playing ice hockey in a community league  .  so  i finally got myself new skates  .  
 what position do you play  ?  
 i  m a defender  .  it  s a lot of fun  .  you don  t have to be able to skate as fast on defense  .  
 yeah  you  re a pretty big guy  .  i play goalie  myself  .  
 oh  yeah  ?  which team  ?  
 the rockets  .  
 really  ?  i think we play you guys next week  .  well  i have to go to practice  .  see you later  .  
what  s the mountaineering club doing this weekend  ?  
 we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river  .  
 how hard is the climb  ?  
 it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet  .  
 what did you do last week  ?  
 we rappelled down the side of   foot cliff  .  it was very exciting  .  
 wow  !  that sounds like a lot of fun  .  i  m sorry i missed it  .  
 well  you should come this weekend  .  i think you could do the climb  .  
 yeah  i will  .  see you then  !  
hey joanne  .  what are you up to  ?  
 i 'm just watching some television  .  
 i 'm so bored  .  i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning  .  
 me too  .  do you think we are boring people  ?  
 i do n't think we are boring  .  it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies  .  
 that 's right  .  what do you think we should do as a hobby  ?  
 that all depends on what you like to do  .  for example  i like to doodle on the notepad  so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings  .  
 i like to play the piano for fun  .  
 yeah  .  that can be a good hobby  .  
 hobbies are great  .  i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do  .  
hi  john  how was your vacation  ?  
 awesome  we went to australia and new zealand  .  
 that must have been wonderful  .  do anything interesting  ?  
 well  we went bungee jumping when we were in australia  .  
 wow  !  isn  t that dangerous  ?  
 a little  but the rush was worth it  .  
 tell me about it  .  
 we jumped off a bridge and fell  feet before the bungee cord caught us  .  
  feet  !  i would never be able to do that  .  
mike 's going to have a selfdriving traveling across the country  .  
 really  ?  he is so great  .  
 you do n't want to join him  ?  
 surely i want  .  it 's quite popular nowadays  .  
what is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space  ?  
 i was n't quite prepared for the view of the earth as we left  .  it was just aweinspiring  .  it emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole earth  where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance  .  i was n't quite prepared for that  .  it 's inevitably etched in my memory  .  
 when viewing the earth from space  do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind  ?  
 detached  .  you 're literally detached from one planet  captured by another  .  your only link to reality is the earth out there  fortunate  y  it stays in view the whole time  .  
 there 're a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality  .  is it going to be some future project that never happens  ?  
 i believe it 's certainly for real  .  it without question has suffered a lot of delays  .  but there 's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it 's due to go off in december  .  it is a reality  .  it has just taken longer to get literally off the ground  .  
 there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission  .  it seemed to fizzle out  .  do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public 's passion for space and get us to mars sooner  ?  
 i hope this flight is not just a onetime affair  that it does reignite people 's interest to push on  .  but only time will tell  .  
 you had gone to the moon twice  orbited space around the earth lots of times  and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have  .  how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness  ?  i just ca n't wait  .  
are the ceremony and reception held in the same place  ?  
 no  not usually  .  most people are married in a church  and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception  .  sometimes  however  they hold the reception in a big room in the church  .  
 where do they go  ?  
 either they go to a public place such as a hotel  a restaurant  or a club  or to the home of the brid 
 they go to the home of the bride  ?  
 why do you ask  ?  
 the chinese custom is to go to the groom 's homejust the opposite  .  
 oh  !  in our country the bride 's family is responsible for the entire weddingarrangement  costs  etc  .  so the reception is held at her home  .  
 that 's very expensive for the family of the bride  .  
 many american furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding  .  
 tell me something about the bridal bouquet  .  is n't it the custom to throw it  ?  
 yes  .  when the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place  .  the bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it  .  the one who does will be the next one married  .  
i 'm reading an interesting report on mars  .  
 oh  what does it say  ?  does it say water could still exist under the surface of mars  ?  
 absolutely  !  it says there is water on mars buried beneath the surface  .  it 's just a matter of how deep it is  .  
 then could the soil on mars somehow be fertile enough to groh simple plants  ?  
 the soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything  .  and it would need to be protected from the uv radiation  .  
 actually  we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on mars for an extended period of time  .  does nasa have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet  ?  
 i 'm not sure nasa has built any portable habitats for extended stays on mars  but they have looked at various designs  .  
 one of the most exciting things about mars is that there could have bean life on it  .  what are your personal opinions on the life on mars theory  ?  
 well  i 'm not really an expert in this area  but my understanding is that anything is possible  .  it 's just that it is so hard to determine what went on  .  billion years ago  .  
 but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans  .  
 i 'm skeptical  .  mars is made of rocks containing silicon  iron  and various minerals  .  it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide  .  it is so different from what we have on earth  you know  .  
 i 'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there  .  
is there any ticket left for tonight 's concert  ?  
 i am sorry  sir . all the tickets have been sold out  .  
 what a shame  .  will there be the same performance tomorrow evening  ?  
 sorry  sir  .  the only tickets of the same performance available are on st  .  
oh  ralph  i heard it is very dangerous traveling in space  .  disasters have happened before  .  if the spaceship were out of order  .   .   .  
 you should be optimistic about this  .  things have taken a good turn  .  you should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible  .  
 but is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors  ?  
 it 's once in blue moon  .  
 what do you think is the real danger man faced in space  ?  
i want to buy two tickets for tonight 's concert  .  
 sure  .  how do you like your seats  ?  
 ordinary one  please  .  
 ok  here are your tickets in row   .  
 i think they are too far from the stage  .  i want two in row   .  
are the galaxies in the universe moving through space  ?  
 no  the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them  .  but not too much  .  as the space between galaxies expands  it carries the galaxies further apart  like raisins in an expanding dough  .  
 but i heard that our milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy  .  if galaxies are moving apart from each other  how can they collide  ?  
 well  the universe is a chaotic place  and the gravity from one galaxy  or from a group of galaxies  may disturb the motion of its near neighbors  causing them to collide  .  however  on average  when you compare two large enough chunks of space  the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other  .  
 wow  you 're really informative  .  thanks a lot  .  
do you have anything to do after this  ?  
 no  i do n't  .  
 shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks  ?  
 that sounds like a good idea  .  
 i know a very interesting place  .  
recently  there prevails net love  !  
 what 's net love  ?  
 two people chat on the net and step by step fall into love  !  it 's net love  .  
 ridiculous  !  they have n't met  !  maybe they 're the same sex  !  
 maybe yesterday you 've received a man's woos  .  he 's called beast  ?  
 how could you know  ?  
 i watched the screen display  !  
 do you know he is ms  .  rebecca  !  
 it 's typical net love  and a typical lesbians homosex  !  ha  !  
i visited the polar aquarium today  .  
 is it like a zoo of polar animals  ?  
 almost  .  there are a lot of polar animals sea birds  such as seals  whales and penguins  people do n't get much chance of seeing them  .  
 it must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds  .  
 absolutely  .  to be frank  i learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas  .  i 'm thinking of my kids there one of these days  .  
when do children start school in your country  ?  
 normally at six  .  before that  they spend several years in the kindergarten or preschool education center  .  
 but thats only in the cities  isnt it  ?  
 right  .  in the countryside  things are more complicated  .  
 can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities  ?  
let me see  .  how much should i pay for you  ?  
 don  t think about it  !  
 no  this will not do  .  let me see  .  
 you pay for the taxi and dinner  then to even things up  .  
jim and you are bosom friends  are n't you  ?  
 i would n't say so  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
i am fed up with jack  .  he is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt  .  
 so he is  .  but  why not try to help him to become stronger  ?  
look  there are some words on the fish  .  
 i know that they are auspicious fish  .  it 's quite popular nowadays  .  
 for god 's sake  !  it 's too bloody  .  how can people be so cruel  ?  
 not at all  .  i think the tattoos are so cool and chic  .  
 you ca n't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people  .  
 honey  it 's not so serious  .  it 's just an animal  .  
 just an animal  ?  but it has life too  .  if you want a tattoo  get one  .  it 's your choice because you want it  .  but has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one  ?  
john  do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic  ?  
 sure  .  have you checked the weather report  ?  
 yes  .  it says it will be sunny all day  .  no sign of rain at all  .  
 i 'd like some toast and chicken wings  .  
 okay  .  please take some fruit salad and crackers for me  .  
 done  .  oh  do n't forget to take napkins  disposable plates  cups and picnic blanket  .  
 that 's great  .  we can also take the dragon kite with us  .  after the picnic  we can fly it  .  
 cool  we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket  .  
may  is this the hall of ancient china  ?  
 yes  .  look at these historical relics here  amazing  !  
 why are they all in glass boxes  ?  
 for protection  .  some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air  .  
 so there is n't air in the glass boxes  ?  
 no  there is n't  .  there is a vacuum in every box  .  
 i wonder how old these things are  .  thousands of years  ?  
 yeah  they all come from a very ancient time  .  
 hey  look at the tripod  .  i 've seen it on tv  .  
i  m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up  .  
 be careful of what you say  or you  ll have to eat humble pie  .  
hi  sue  .  what 's up  ?  
 hey  andrew  .  how 's everything with work  ?  
 ok  i guess  .  my boss has been on my back recently  .  
 really  ?  what 's he been doing  ?  
 you know  just giving me lots to do  .  i 'm really busy right now  .  
 are you  ?  what are you busy with  ?  
i 'd better be going  .  
 so soon  ?  why do n't you stay a little longer  ?  
 i wish i could  but it 's already late  .  
 oh  it 's a pity that you have to leave  .  
 thank you for a wonderful meal  .  
if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes  .  
 yes  .  the german engineer would never dreamed that the hand  supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the occident within a few years and even spread to japan and china  .  
 looking at the five sense organs of a scooter  it can be said as delicate and agile  .  to pull the tshaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically  adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it  .  
 small and exquisite in size  easy to operate  foldable and easy to carry are its charms  .  
how 'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  i promised to help my sister move saturday  .  
 how about sunday  then  ?  we could start in the morning  .  
 i might be able to do that  .  but i do n't think i can do it well  .  
 do n't worry  .  it is a test of physical endurance  intelligence  .  just to finish it is considered a victory for most  .  
i 'm afraid i 've got to go  .  i have another appointment at five  .  
 do you  ?  by the way  could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby  ?  
 no problem  .  
 thank you  .  come back to my office at the same time tomorrow  .  i 'll have the pictures ready by then  .  
it seems that you are an optimistic man who does n't dismay easily  .  that is what a good salesman needs  .  good luck  .  
 thank you  .  
 i guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it 's time to say goodbye  .  
how do you usually sell your products now  ?  
 i 'm doing business through internet now  .  
 oh  really  ?  is it a good way  ?  
 yes  very good  .  
 what advantages does it have  ?  
 it is very convenient  .  you know you can browse the website and send emails to your customers at any time  .  
 yes  if we do business through other ways  it will cost a lot of time  .  
 also it has low cost  and you know you only need to pay the fee of internet  which is very cheap  .  
 yes  going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much  .  but does it have any disadvantages  ?  
 to be frank  sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways  .  
 you mean there may be credit problems  ?  
 yes  but if you choose some good bb websites  such problems can be avoided  .  
 will you give some suggestion  ?  
 of course  such as the alabama  which is a famous website  .  
how do you shoot pool  ?  
 you have  balls on the table   solid colored   striped colored  a black  ball  and the white ball  .  
 and  ?  
 you hit the white ball with your cue  .  the white ball hits the colored balls  .  and you want to get the colored balls into the pockets  .  
 how do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one  ?  
 at the beginning  it does not matter  but once someone gets one ball in  it is set  .  
 can i get the black ball in  ?  
 the black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets  .  
hi  .  have you got a personal computer  ?  
 certainly  .  what 's the matter  ?  
 i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet  .  
 sure  .  i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores  .  
 great  !  it 's just like viewless stores  .  but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line  ?  
 that 's simple  .  just click the hyperlink  www . taobao . com or www  .  ebay . com  and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen  and then you can place an order online with the sales company  .  and the goods will be delivered to your place  .  
 is the service charged  ?  
 no  .  it 's free  .  
hey  let 's go to the night market after work tonight  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  i have n't been in a while and i need to get a new backpack  .  the old one is hanging on by a thread  !  
today more and more families have personal computers  .  people have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world  .  
 right  .  with the establishment of internet and a lot of web companies  people are getting more and more dependent on the web  .  
 one of the common uses of pc is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores  .  
 can you tell me how it is done  ?  
 if a customer is interested in some certain goods  he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen  and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company  .  and then the goods you want will be delivered to your home  .  the service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge  .  
tom  you look thoughtful and unhappy recently  .  what 's wrong with you  ?  
 lily broke up with me last week  .  in fact  she dumped me  .  
 why  ?  i mean  why did she part company with you after seven years together  ?  
 she said it was because we had very different ideas about life  .  
 do you believe her excuse  ?  
 of course not  .  i knew she had fallen in love with another guy  .  it is difficult to see her move on so quickly  .  
 come on  buddy  cheer up  .  why not do some sports with me  ?  violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love  .  
are you working or are you a student  ?  
 i 'm a student  .  
 which school are you studying at  ?  
nick  it 's very nice of you to see me off  .  
 you 're welcome  .  did you have a good time on this vacation  ?  
 very well  .  if i leave i 'll miss you  .  
 me too  .  please write to me as soon as you get boston  .  
 i 'm sure and i remembered your phone number  .  i 'll call you  .  
 ok  they begin to register  .  
 it 's time i left  .  
do you live with your parents  ?  
 no  they live in shanghai  my hometown  .  
 how often do you go back to visit them  ?  
bill  do you know if the cafeteria around the corner 's open today  ?  
 yes  .  they were open this morning when i came to work  .  they must 've finished remodeling  .  why do you want to know  ?  
 well  i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today  .  that is  if you have n't promised to go with someone else  .  
 that 'd be wonderful  peter  .  but i hope you 're in a better mood than you were this morning  .  
 i 'm sorry i was such a grouch  .  it must 've been the weather  .  when it rains i get depressed  .  
may i invite you to dance with me  ?  
 sorry  i ca n't dance  .  
 never mind  i can teach you  .  
 is it difficult to learn  ?  
 no  it is easy  .  
 how should i do  ?  
 you just follow me  .  
 all right  .  by the way  do you often dance  ?  
 yup  because dance can relax myself  .  
hey  let 's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight  !  
 sorry  i ca n't  .  i have to work late at the laboratory  .  
 nigel  you sure lead a dog 's life  what 's up with that  ?  
how will you spend this lovely weekend  ?  
 i have no idea  any suggestions  ?  
 we have n't played chess for a long time  .  how about playing chess  ?  
 it must be fun  .  but you know  i am not good at chess  .  i never won since i 've learnt to play chess  .  
 don  t worry  i will teach you how to win  .  
 ok  settled then  .  
 see you tomorrow  .  
harry is a henpecked husband  .  
 no  he isn  t  .  
 then why does he let himself be lead by the nose  ?  
i have never you mention this friend  .  are you on very good terms with him or her  ?  
 we have been on good terms  .  she is a very nice girl  .  but she got in dutch with her boss  .  i don  t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements  .  
 you must be stuck on her  or you would not use your elbow grease  .  
do you like tea  ?  
 yes  but i do n't know much about it  .  
 tea does good to people 's health  .  there are many kinds of tea . say  black tea  green tea  scented tea  brick tea  milk tea  jas  mine tea  chrysanthemum tea and so on  .  
 my favourite is jasmine tea  .  i like its aroma  .  
can you believe me  ?  
 sure  .  
 please count on my love  .  
 i will  .  
 i 'll be yours through endless time  .  
 i see  .  and i 'll always be devoted to you  .  
 thank you  .  i know i 've nothing to offer you  but i 'll never give you reason to cry  .  
 i 'll never hurt you  i 'll never lie  .  
 my love will grow  like a river to flow  .  
 it ca n't be dry  and ca n't die  .  
 i do n't know whether we are in a dream  .  
what good sunshine  !  let 's go and get a suntan on the balcony  .  
 i 've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day  .  i do n't need any more suntan  .  
 it 's different in my case  .  i work in the office  so only rarely do i get the chance to get any sun  .  
we 'd like a halfday package  .  
 we offer many different sea water treatments  .  
 how many can we choose  ?  
 the aquamedic pool is included  .  you can choose three  .  
 we 'll do the seaweed wrap  the jet bath  and the foot massage  .  
that was heaven  !  
 the sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you  .  
 really  ?  
 but the water has to be kept at  degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body  .  
hey  joshua  !  is anny coming with us  ?  
 yes  why  ?  
 nothing  .  i 'm just asking  .  
 just asking  ?  but why is your face burning like mad  ?  aha  someone has a crush on anny  does n't he  ?  
 who has a crush  ?  
 come on  josh  do n't be such a chicken  .  if you like her  you 've got to tell her  .  maybe she likes you  .  
 i 'd totally die if she turned me down  .  
happy anniversary  sweetheart  !  
 yes  .  to our first anniversary and many more to come  .  cheers  !  
 i 'll drink to that  .  thanks for making this a night worth remembering  .  
 well  it 's a special day  .  they say if you survive the first year  the rest is smooth sailing  .  
 that 's good to know  .  oh  listen  !  the band 's playing our song  .  
 i requested it  .  what do you say  ?  do you have your dancing shoes on  ?  
flowers for my favorite girl  .  
 how did you know that i love red roses  ?  
 that 's a secret  .  here  let me help you with your coat  and we 'll be on our way  .  
  at the dance  that band is playing good music  .  shall we dance  ?  
 fine  what do you call this  ?  
 foxtrot  .  oh  .  you 're a good dancer  .  
 really  ?  thank you  .  i am thinking the same thing about you  .  
rose  the weekend is coming  .  let 's discuss what we will do  .  
 what about going to the zoo on saturday and to the park on sunday  ?  
 sounds good  .  but on saturday there 's a football final  .  
 then  what shall we do on sunday  .  
 let me see  .  we can visit the country  .  we have n't done that for such a long time  .  
 good idea  .  i 'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby  .  we 'll go to the zoo and the park another time  .  after all  we can put that off  .  
what a nice dress  jean . you look marvelous  !  
 you  too  .  where did you get your new hat  ?  
 from the crown's  .  oh  what lovely earrings you have  !  are they diamond  ?  
 yes  .  it 's a birthday present from my husband  !  
 well  you are lucky to have such a considerate husband  .  mine has n't brought me a single rose since we married  .  
 he 'll come out with surprises  .  just wait and see  .  look at that woman  with the white chiffon  !  
 she 's chic  is n't she  ?  
 yes  .  i like the dress  .  it must be the latest fashion  .  look  the hem has lowered  and the waist narrowed  .  
 it makes me feel rather shabby  .  that woman has a good taste in dressing  i would say  .  
 yes  .  she dressed with an individual flair  .  i rather envy her  .  
 most women follow fashion like sheep . they do n't know any better than imitate  .  
 i quite agree with you . see the woman there  ?  i dare say she has n't got any eyes  .  how could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag  ?  and all that jewelry  !  
 the gown is quite expensive  believe me  .  
 so what  ?  it only makes her look cheap and vulgar  .  
 you know those upstarts  .  they 're all showoffs  !  i think i 'd better have a diet  otherwise i 'd look like a ballon soon  .  
 you 're quite slim  .  in fact  if you were one of those starlets  the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure  .  
 thanks  .  i 'm flattered  .  
let me hold the door for you  miss  .  
julia  are you free tonight  ?  
 what 's up  ?  
 i want to invite you to go to the movies  .  
 are you asking me for a date  ?  
 yes  .  
 i don  t like to go to the movies on a date  .  it 's noisy there  .  
 where do you want to meet  ?  
 let 's go to the coffee shop then  .  it 's quiet there  .  
 what time should we meet  ?  
 how about seven  ?  
mr . martin  we 're on arrival  .  
 it 's nice of you to see my off at the airport  .  thank you very much  .  
 we 'll miss you  .  i hope we 'll keep in touch  .  
 sure  .  you 've given a great help to me in the past days  .  
 it 's my pleasure  .  we hope you 'll visit beijing again  .  
 certainly  .  i 'll be glad to  .  
 it 's almost time to get aboard  .  
 yes  we should go  .  thank you very much  .  goodbye  !  
do you want to go out for dinner tonight  ?  
 sure  .  have you got anywhere in mind  ?  
 i 'm starving  so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions  .  
 that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions  .  do you want to go there  ?  
 i 'm not really in the mood for italian  actually  .  i was thinking of something a bit spicy  .  
 if you want spicy food  then i 'd recommend going to a thai  indian or chinese restaurant  .  how about that chinese buffet on cowley road  ?  
 i really like that restaurant  you get a lot for your money there  .  but  they 've westernized their food  so it 's not actually that spicy  .  
 you 're right  .  most of their dishes have sweet sauces  .  we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us  .  
 the taj  ?  they 're a bit expensive  but they do serve large portions of very hot food  .  
 the taj it is then  .  
 shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money  ?  
 they 'll still charge us a corkage fee  .  
 that 's right  .  it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway  .  
 do n't worry about money  .  i 'll treat you tonight  .  
 are you sure  ?  we could go dutch  .  
 no  i 'll pay  .  it 's my turn anyway  .  you paid last time  .  
what a nice day  !  why do n't we go for an outing  ?  
 sure . where would you suggest  ?  
 how about going to the suburbs  ?  
mum  this is for you  .  
 oh  flowers  !  what for  my dear  ?  
 happy mother 's day to you  mum  !  
happy new year  jim  !  
 thank you  same to you  !  lee  have you got any plans  ?  
 yeah  i 'm going to the temple fair with my family  .  
merry christmas  linda  !  
 merry christmas  lee  !  
 linda  thank you for this wonderful christmas dinner  .  i really enjoyed it  .  
hi  where have you been  ?  
 i was away for my vacation  .  
 oh  how was it  ?  
victoria  you are back from vacation  !  how was it  ?  
 to tell the truth  i feel tired  .  
 how come  ?  
i like the kid . he s so lovely  .  
 how old is he  ?  
you missed the film . that s a shame  .  
 is it stimulating  ?  
 yes  .  i got very excited  .  
my friend jean is very beautiful  .  
 what 's her figure  ?  
 perfect  and i like her charming eyes too  .  
 what 's the color of her eyes  ?  
tony looks very handsome in the suit  .  
 he prefers suits to jackets  .  
 judge from his look  he 's a very serious person  .  
what do you think of the speech the man delivered just now  ?  
 do n't believe him . he s a liar  .  
what do you think of your teacher  ?  
 he 's very strict with us  .  
 and i hear he gives very good lectures  .  
i have n't met the smiths for a long time  .  
 they have moved to chicago  .  
 why  ?  
judy  have you ever made out how much money shall we spend  ?  
 oh  yeah  .  the total amount is no less than  rib  according to our itinerary  .  
 what  ?  that 's too much  .  
 sit down  .  i 'll show you the list of our financial budget  .  first of all  it is nearly  rib that we should spend in transportation  .  
 ah  the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget  .  
 then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel  .  but if we want to save money  we can choose a hotel which is not so good  .  
 hmm  what i 'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel  .  
are you going anywhere for your vacation  ?  
 yes  we 're making plans for a tour  .  
 that 'll be lovely  .  where are you going  ?  
 well start out from long island this friday  .  we 've planned a four day drive to salt lake city  where we 'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday  .  
 well  you 've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then  .  
 oh  we 'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by  .  how does it sound  david  ?  
 it sounds good  .  you can do a lot of sightseeing  too  .  
 yes  we 'll take our time  .  and we 'll go to fivelake strict and the wall street  .  
 so  you 're going to have a really nice vacation  .  
a new film is on  .  have you ever seen it  ?  
 what kind of movie is it  ?  
 it 's a feature film  .  
good afternoon  !  
 good afternoon  !  sit down  please . how are you  ?  
 i 'm very well  thank you . how are you  ?  
 very well too  thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day  ?  
 yes  it 's beautiful  but it 's also very hot  .  
 yes  .  
 what 's the weather like in your country  ?  
 mm  .  .  .  it 's quite warm now  .  
 where do you live  ?  
 in london . where do you live  ?  
good morning  mei  !  how are you  ?  
 hi tom  !  i 'm fine  and you  ?  
 not bad thanks  .  
 good  .  see you  !  
which season do you like best  ?  
 i like spring  .  
 why  ?  
 oh  everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer  .  
what happened  ?  
 i do n't know  .  
 let 's stop and have a look  .  
 do n't waste time  .  
 i 'm curious about that  .  
it 's too hot to read  .  
 we 'd better go out for a walk  .  
 which season do you like best  ?  
 spring  .  
 how about summer  ?  
 i dislike it most  .  
 why  ?  
 because the hottest season is summer in a year  .  
look at the cloud  .  
 it 's going to rain  .  
john  my father is n't there at all  .  are you kidding  ?  
 cool  fellow  what 's the date today  buddy  ?  
 it 's  .  .  .  oh it 's the st april  april fool 's day  .  
when were you born may i ask  ?  
 on th may   .  
 do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar  ?  
 th day of the fourth month  .  
 by the way  could you tell me when the film will begin  ?  
 it will begin at   .  
 i am afraid i ca n't be there on time  .  
 you can see it tomorrow  .  
well  how did you enjoy your seaside trip  ?  
 it was funny  .  
 tell me about it  will you  ?  
 well  we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning  .  it was a magnificent sight  .  
 did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures  ?  
 sure  we would n't miss it for anything  .  after that  we took a short cut to the park  .  there was very little traffic  so we got there in less than an hour  .  
 you were lucky then  .  what did you do after that  ?  
 we went for a swim in the sea  .  that was the best part of the day  .  just look at my nice tan  .  
 so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday  .  
i usually get a lot of information on the computer and use email to send messages to my friends  .  
 me too . recently  i 'm fascinated with netchat  .  i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them  .  i really enjoy it  .  
 do n't you think it s a sheer waste of both time and money  ?  
so alex  you  re off to the olympic stadium then  ?  
 yes  i should get there just in time for the women  s m relay  .  
 wow  that should be really exciting  especially with so many famous athletes there  .  
 yes  i  m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump  .  
 well have a good time  .  get me some autographs if you can  .  
every time when heroes came back from the battlefield  we took our hats off to them  .  
 you were showing respect and admiration for them  .  
what shall we do after the volleyball match  ?  
 how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look  ?  i remember there is one in the gym  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family  .  
 me  too  .  what did you have in mind  ?  
 i have n't decided yet  but i think the olympic mascots are a must  .  
 i agree  .  they 're very lovely  especially huanhuan 
 is that the red one  ?  that is my favorite  too  .  do you know how much they are  ?  
 the five dolls are sold together as a set  and they 're priced according to the size  .  the bigger they are the more expensive  .  
 oh  i see  .  if i buy more than a set  can i get any discount  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now  .  
 any other ideas  ?  
 there are lots of things  such as postcards  key chains  posters and various arts and crafts  .  
how  s your trip going  ?  
 oh i  m enjoying myself but it  s so hot here 
 isn  t london hot in the summer  ?  
 well it can be but shanghai is much warmer than london  .  
 i see  .  what about transport  ?  how does shanghai compare to london  ?  
 actually i think the buses and trains here are more modern  .  
 and what about the number of people on the streets  ?  
cindy  how come nearly all the primetime tv shows are comedies  ?  
 that 's because americans love sitcoms  .  
 sitcoms  ?  
 situation comedies  .  a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly  .  sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people  .  if there is one thing that all the shows have in common  it is teaching wholesome values  .  
 in taiwan  primetime shows are an hour long and most of them are n't comedies  .  
have you been to shanghai before  ?  
 yes i have  .  i  ve been there three times in the past year  .  
 that sounds great  .  have you been to the top of the pearl tower  ?  
 no i haven  t  .  i haven  t visited the bund either  .  i  ve always had too much work to do  .  
 so you haven  t done much then  in shanghai  ?  
hello martin  .  have you been to any events yet  ?  
 yes i have  .  i went to the table tennis yesterday  .  
 oh wow  .  how was it  ?  
 oh  .  it was great  .  i love ma lin  .  he  s my favourite table tennis player  .  have you seen anything yet  ?  
 oh i still haven  t managed to get any tickets  .  i  d love to see something though  .  
 well  let  s go to the marathon tomorrow then  !  we can just stand by the side of the road  .  
what happened to you yesterday  ?  
 oh i fell over on the way to work  .  
 oh i see  .  so that  s why you didn  t come in  ?  
 yes and i broke my phone too so i couldn  t call you  .  
 oh dear  that sounds terrible  .  
 it was  !  but the worst thing was i tore my best shirt  .  
oh that  s a lovely necklace  .  
 thank you  .  my husband gave it to me  .  
 oh i didn  t know you were married  .  
 yes i am  .  i got married five years ago  .  
 oh i see  .  that  s nice  .  did you meet your husband at work  ?  
oh you look awful  !  what  s the matter  ?  
 oh  !  i feel really under the weather  .  i  ve got a sore throat and a bad cough  .  
 oh dear  .  maybe you  ve caught a cold  .  
 yes  i  ve had lots of overtime to do recently and i haven  t slept much at all  .  
 well then  you should get some rest this weekend and don  t go out drinking  .  
you married joe  did n't you  ?  
 joe  ?  i do n't know what you mean  .  
 i remember you are in love  .  
 oh  i took a shine to him when we met for the first time  .  but it comes and goes  .  
it is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas  .  
 so the reform cannot be carried out well  .  
 government is making efforts to change situation  .  
where is tom  ?  
 he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep  .  
 what  ?  it  s only p  .  m  .  now  .  why today he went to bed so early  ?  
 he ran four miles and came back dead beat  .  
i think that  s settled  .  
 i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions  .  who do you think you are  !  
 how dare you speak to me like this  .  
do n't cover up your sadness  .  let it go  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  
 it is n't your fault  .  no one will blame you  .  
i feel pity for the old man  .  
 i feel the same way  .  
 it must be dreadful to grow old  .  
where is john  ?  i ca n't find him anywhere  .  
 have n't you heard that he is in prison  ?

diana  do you like the perfume i gave you  ?

 i  m sorry  .  i didn  t know that  .  
excuse me  .  may i take a picture of you and your little boy  ?  
 what  s it for  ?  
 it  s for a book  .  
 oh  that  s a nice idea  .  well  it  s fine if you take our picture  .  
are you doing anything tonight  ?  
 no  nothing  .  why  ?  
 do you like western music  ?  
 yes  i do  very much  .  
 there  s a concert tonight  .  would you like to go and listen to it  ?  
i decided to go for this kind of life  .  
 try to keep cool  .  it 's not an easy take  .  
 i know  .  i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst  .  
hi  how are you doing  ?  
 everything 's great  .  and you  ?  
 same here . have you seen any new films recently  ?  
 no  i have n't had a chance to  .  but i have been watching a chinese tv scries called  chinesestyle divorce   .  
 oh  .  really  ?  i saw it two years ago  .  it 's worth seeing and it 's thoughtprovoking  .  
 yeah  .  i found it is so close to our life  .  
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this everchanging world  .  
 you said it  .  you know  the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year  .  
 well  it 's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too  .  
 i know a couple who divorced a week after getting married  .  
 oh  that 's too shortlived  .  
 that 's true  .  it 's said the shortlived marriage is typical of the post  s generation  .  
 ii ca n't agree more  .  the onlychildgeneration in china tends to know little about marriage  .  
 definitely . they do n't take relationships and marriages very seriously  .  
 in their mind  love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone  .  
when she told me that she would marry no man but dick  my heart was almost in my mouth  .  
 you were scared  too  ?  i dared not tell you my feeling when i heard that  .  i almost got fainted  .  
 i could not and can  t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like dick  .  he plays the field with many girls  .  
mrs  .  smith  you are always worried about your children  .  
 they are my own flesh and blood  .  it  s hard for me to see them suffering  .  
hi  kenji  .  
 hi  debbie  .  have a seat  .  how 's it going  ?  
 i 'm ok  .  how are you doing  ?  
 pretty good  .  listen  .  .  .  have you heard about the new thai restaurant over on university avenue  ?  
 do you mean the bangkok  ?  
 that 's the one  .  a bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night . how about coming with us  ?  
 sure  i 'd love to  .  
 great  .  i 'll call and make reservations  .  
 any time after  o 'clock is good for me . oh  !  i 'm late  !  i have a class  .  
 all right  .  i 'll call you tonight and tell you the time  .  
hello  .  could i speak to justin  please  ?  
 speaking  .  
 oh  hi justin  .  this is karen hepburn . we met at chris and jim 's party  .  
 of course  .  how 're you  ?  
 great  .  uh  justin  would you like to see otis lesley on thursday night  ?  he 's at the kangaroo club  .  
 i 'm sorry  karen  but i ca n't  .  i have to work late this thursday  .  
 oh  .  .  .  that 's too bad  .  
 yeah  .  i really like lesley  .  
 actually  are you doing anything on friday or saturday  ?  he 's playing those two nights as well  .  
 well  i ca n't make it on friday either  but i 'm free on saturday night  .  what time does it start  ?  
 at eight sharp . how about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven  ?  
 that sounds perfect . and let 's go out for coffee after the show  .  
 sure  !  
our son is gone and my heart is gone too  .  i don  t know how to spend the rest of my years  .  
 oh  darling  we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music  .  i know you can pull yourself together  .  
 i feel life is meaningless without him  .  
my mother likes to split hairs  .  
 what do you mean by that  ?  
 she has keen to buy something which is much cheaper  .  
i am tired of everything in my life  .  
 what  ?  how happy you life is  !  i do envy you  .  
 you don  t know that i have been overprotected by my mother these years  .  i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings  .  
ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one  .  
 the reason is that he once was bitten by a dog  .  
we must set  dollars aside each month  .  
 why  ?  
 we are going to buy our own house  .  
you are in love with mary  right  ?  
 you are pulling my legs  !  
well  known  jim  i 'm  .  .  .  i 'm pretty much in favour of computers  i think computers teach kids to think  because they require logical thought  .  
 but i  .  .  .  i do n't agree with that  because computers weaken kids ability to think  because kids do n't learn basic skills  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 they ca n't spell  they ca n't add  they ca n't subtract  they even do n't remember any more . that s because they rely on gadgets  .  
it  s time for me to go now  .  
 would you like me to go with you  ?  
 i  d rather you stayed in the office and did these things  .  
 do you want to type that letter  ?  
 i  d rather you typed it  .  
 do you want to tell her  ?  
are you going out again  ?  
 yes  i 'm going to the cinema  dad  .  
 you must n't go to bed very late  .  can you be home before nine  .  
 oh  i wo n't be back so early  .  the film will be over at nine  .  can i have the key to the bicycle  ?  
 no  .  i wo n't let you ride a bicycle late at night  .  
 oh  dad  i 'm not a child  .  i 'm  already  .  i 'll come back as soon as the film is over  .  
 ok  .  here 's the key  .  take care  .  
you must n't touch the wet paint  bill  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  i wo n't do it again  .  
 try to be more careful in future  .  look  !  you 've damaged the sign  .  
 is this the sign  ?  what does it says  ?  
how was the movie last night  ?  
 i did n't really like it  .  
 mary said that she was really pleased with the photography  .  
 i found it very disappointing  .  
 she liked the acting  too  because that 's what she wanted to see  .  
 i was n't happy with it  .  
do you know who  s just got married  ?  old mc donald  .  
 never  !  he  s over   isn  t he  ?  
 he  s nearly   .  
 good gracious  !  are you sure  ?  
 i am  .  whatsmore  his wife is   .  
 is she really  ?  
 yes  she is  .  and guess what  he is her sixth husband  .  
john's very late . do you think he 's coming  ?  
 well  it does n't seem like it . he must have forgotten  .  
tom  you promised to cut the lung  .  you wo n't forget  will you  ?  
 no  i assure you  .  
 and you 'll repair the television  wo n't you  ?  
 ok  .  
 do you promise  ?  
 of course  .  
 and tom  you will help johnny with his homework  wo n't you  ?  
 i 'll see  .  i will if i can but i wo n't promise  .

 at least more than  years old  .  
 let 's enter it  !  
 i ca n't open the door  .  
 it must be locked  .  
 let me ask the old woman in that reception office  .  
 she ca n't answer you  .  
 she must be deaf  .  
 it must be a haunted house . are you frightened  ?

 what about saturday  ?  
 sorry  i never go out on saturday evening  .  i always watch football on saturday evening  .  
 will you come round next tuesday  ?  
 next tuesday  ?  just a moment  .  it will be the twentyfirst of may  ?  oh  dear  .  hum  i promised my aunt i  ll be at her birthday party  .  
 what do you say next wednesday then  ?  
 let me see  .  yes  mary  .  let  s make it next wednesday  .  
 okay  .  bye  .  
it  s very kind of you to invite me to dinner  .  
 please sit down and make yourself at home  .  please don  t stand on ceremony  .  
 this dish is really delicious  .  
 i  m glad that you like it  .  this is only the first time that i made it  .  
 you  re great  .  could you say it in chinese  ?  
could you tell me what university you went to  mr  .  smith  ?  
 i went to yale university  .  
 did you  ?  and what did you study  ?  
 i have a b  .  a  .  in economics  .  
 would you mind telling me how old you are  ?  
 i 'm twentyseven  .  
 and could you tell me what other jobs you have had  ?  
 yes  i have worked in a bank for the last years  .  
 and what was your salary at the bank  ?  
good evening . welcome to our program  .  
 thank you . good evening  mr . dean  .  
 would you tell us your name  please  ?  
 i 'm helen baker  .  
 glad to meet you  ms . baker  .  
 glad to meet you  too  .  
 where are you from  ms . baker  ?  
 i 'm from new zealand  .  
 what do you do for a living  ?  
 i 'm a teacher  .  
on saturday night i  m going to have a small gettogether  .  
 good  .  
 would you like to come  ?  
 do you mean this saturday  ?  
 yes  this coming saturday  .  
 thanks for inviting me  jack  but i  ve already made plans for this weekend  .  i won  t be able to come  i  m afraid  .  
 i  m sorry to hear that  .  
 yeah  that  s too bad  .  
are you free on friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner  ?  
 oh  thank you very much  .  i  d like to come  but i  m afraid i  m busy that evening  .  
 that  s a pity  !  then when would it be a good time for you  ?  
 well  i  m not too sure  actually  .  i  ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks  .  why don  t i call you later  ?  
have you found another job yet  sally  ?  
 no  i have n't  but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper  .  
 what kind of job are you looking for  ?  
 either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel  .  
 you have n't had any experience in either of those fields  .  
hi  mr  .  zhang  .  what  s wrong  ?  you don  t look so happy  .  how was your date  ?  
 i was turned down again  .  it  s frustrating  .  i guess you  ve got to teach me some skills  .  
 me  ?  i  m even less experienced than you are  .  
 at least you know what american women generally like in a man  .  
 believe it or not  i guess american women like a man in good shape  which chinese women may not care about so much  .  that  s my honest opinion  .  i know you have been trying very hard  .  
 american men are naturally taller than chinese men  .  so even if i exercise  there aren  t many chances  .  
 no  that  s not true  .  i  ve met two american women who were married to chinese  .  but those chinese look very strong and healthy  .  so if you exercise more often  i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls  .  how old is jacky chan  ?  he  s small and short  .  but i bet he can have any american woman he wants  .  
 you know  that  s going to be a tremendous change for me  .  because i never exercise  .  
hi  kate  .  
 hi  don  .  what a surprise  !  
 yeah  i saw someone walking like you  but i wasn  t sure  .  we haven  t seen each other for how long  ?  almost three months  ?  but you look quite different now  .  
 have you noticed what has changed  ?  
 oh  you look quite slender and more vivacious  .  what have you been taking  ?  are you on a diet  ?  
 yes  .  i  m on a diet  but i  ve not taken anything  .  i just eat less and exercise more  .  and it really worked in the past three months  .  i  ve lost twelve pounds  .  
 wow  !  that  s great  .  i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals  but it  s difficult for me to keep up the exercise  .  also you know  old habits are hard to break  .  
 what kind of exercise do you think i do  ?  i just go to dance everyday after work  .  i  m taking an amateur dance class  .  i dance two hours everyday  .  
 dance  ?  you only go dancing  ?  that  s not hard  .  i can do that  .  
hey  shirley  !  want to join me for lunch  .  .  .  my treat  !  
 wow  !  sure  !  
 i must confess i have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch  .  
 oh  .  .  .  that 's ok  .  .  .  as long as you 're buying  !  
 i really want to pick your brain about something i 've been thinking a lot about  .  
 i 'd love to help if i can  .  
 well  as you know  i have a bachelor 's degree in english literature and that 's served me well so far  but i 've always wanted to do some postgraduate work  .  .  .  maybe even get a doctorate  !  
 wow  !  just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain  .  
 but you have a master 's degree  .  .  .  has n't that helped your career  ?  
 yeah  i 'd have to say it has  .  but i 'm still paying for it  you know  .  
 i know education is expensive  but it 's been my lifelong dream  .  call me crazy  but i 've always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name  .  
 well  getting a doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school  .  can you afford that  ?  can you survive that  ?  
 i certainly ca n't afford it  but i 'm sure i could find some good student loans  .  
 i think you need to separate the dream of having a phd from the reality of years of more schooling  .  it 's not as romantic as you might think  .  
 yeah  .  .  .  i keep thinking about what i 'll do with a master 's or doctorate  .  i love language but i do n't think there are a lot of wellpaying jobs out there for experts on shakespeare  .  
hey claire  you 've been really quiet these last few days  .  is something wrong  ?  
 i 've been really stressed  .  it 's the end of the year and i 've got so much stuff to do  !  i feel like i 'm drowning in work  .  
 well  stress is a real thing  .  it 's not an imaginary condition  .  
 it 's seriously affecting my life  !  i ca n't sleep  i do n't have much of an appetite and my husband says i 've been kind of short tempered  .  other people seem to handle stress okay  .  .  .  why am i so weak  ?  
 you 're not weak  .  .  .  you 're stressed out  !  stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years  .  back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators  .  .  .  and as you might imagine  that was pretty stressful  .  
 yeah  but i do n't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office  .  my stress is just about silly paperwork  !  
 but you 're actually having the same reaction as our treedwelling ancestors  !  it 's called the flight or fight response  .  each time you feel like something 's threatening you  your body decides whether to run away or fight  .  .  .  it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body  .  
 so a deadline will cause that same reaction  ?  
 it could  .  modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did  .  they just had a couple of close calls every day  but today  we have dozens or even hundreds  !  
hey susan  what are you coming as this year  ?  
 coming as  ?  
 yeah  .  .  .  for halloween  !  we have a big office party tomorrow evening  .  there 's a prize for best costume  !  
 um  .  .  .  i have to confess  i have n't given it much thought  .  i 'm from china and halloween really is n't celebrated there  .  
 really  !  you do n't have some kind of chinese ghost festival  ?  
 oh  .  .  .  sure  .  we have an entire month  !  in traditional chinese culture  ghost month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit  .  
 cool  !  a whole month  !  what do you do during that month  ?  
 well  people sometimes set off firecrackers  some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense . mainly though  you need to feed the ghosts because they 're hungry  .  
 feed them  ?  
 yeah  .  .  .  we set up tables with food  fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts  .  
 and then later everyone eats the food  ?  
 yes  !  how did you guess that  ?  
 it makes sense  right  ?  who else is going to eat it  ?  
 good point  !  
 but no dressing up like ghosts  right  ?  
i heard you are going to move  .  
 yes  i found a better house near my office  .  i  m very satisfied with it  .  but i  m worrying  .  
 what are you worried about  ?  
 i  m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff  .  you know  i have a lot of stuff  .  
 you can call a mover  .  
 how much dose that cost  ?  
 around  rib for a truck  .  
 i think it  s a little expensive  .  
 but think about it  you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers  how much trouble you will save  .  
 that  s right  .  
 i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service  .  i  ll leave you their phone number  .  
 wonderful  .  
 it  s    .  
 okay  thanks a lot  .  you did me a great favor just now  .  
hey  look at the offer i got in my email  .  it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home  !  
 do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i mean that you 're gullible  .  you should n't believe everything you read  especially on the internet  .  
 but it seems like a good idea  .  all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter  .  after that he 'll tell me how to earn much more money  .  
 sounds like a pyramid scheme  .  have you heard of those before  ?  
 pyramid scheme  ?  what is that  ?  
 it 's a scam  that 's based on a hierarchy  like a pyramid  .  the person at the top asks the people below him for money  and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him  .  
 sounds good to me  .  the guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him  .  
 not exactly  .  the scam keeps on going  with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom  .  
 what happens then  ?  
 nothing  .  the people at the bottom give their money to the people above them  and they get nothing  .  they end up losing  .  that 's why it 's a scam  .  
hi amanda  how are you  ?  i 've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week  .  
 we 've missed you too  .  the office just is n't the same without you  .  how is your new job  ?  
 it 's great  .  i really get to focus on what i like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming  .  however  i 'm having a small problem with my new colleagues  .  
 what happened  ?  
 well  three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person  .  
 wow  so you 'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work  !  
 i know  .  it is a lot of money and i have n't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet  .  at our old department  it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us  .  
 well  every department is different  .  you would n't want your new coworkers to think you 're a grinch  right  ?  
 what is that  ?  
 a grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic  .  you know  a party proper  .  
who  s that  ?  
 it  me  .  susan taylor 
 oh  please come in  .  nice to see you  .  
 on  what  re you doing  ?  you look as busy as a bee  .  
 yeah  i  m trying to decorate my house  .  
 really  that  s cool  .  let me see what you  ve done  .  
 but actually it  s not done yet  .  i  m going to get a special pendent lamp  .  
 that  s all right  .  let me see  oh  that lace looks so unique  and it  s so creative to make a picture display here  .  how did you get that idea  ?  
i hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs  .  
 that  s right  we bought it the same day we came on the market  .  
 what kind of house is it  ?  
 it  s a wonderful spanish style  .  
 oh  i love the roof tiles on spanish style houses  .  
 and it  s a bargaining  .  a house like this in river side costs double the price  .  
 great  is it a two bedroom house  ?  
 no  it has three bedrooms and three beds  and has a living room with a twelvefoot ceiling  .  there  s a twocar garage  .  
 that  s a nice area too  .  it  ll be a good investment for you  .  
 yeas  when will you buy a house  ?  
 not untill the end of this year  you know  just before my wedding  .  
 right  congratulations  .  
every year  the south has the floods  .  it is an act of god  .  
 do you really think so  ?  
 yeah  you have some other ideas  ?  
 think  in some way it is an act of god  but in another way  it just is caused by us  .  
 for example  ?  
 we did n't pay attention to the environment  cut down trees and polluted the air  .  
john dates her seven times a week  .  
 really  ?  that 's a straws in the wind  .  
 i think so  .  maybe he 's fallen for her  .  
how do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth  ?  
 at least  it is better than my boxed lunch at work  .  i 'm so fed up with the bland food  .  thank you for having lunch with me  !  
 any time  .  but i do n't mind eating boxed lunch  .  the food sanitation is really good too  .  
 it 's hard to believe that you like it  .  you are so easy to be satisfied  .  
 hey  it 's not that bad  .  the food is nutritious and it 's really convenient  .  i do n't want to spend too much time on eating stuff  .  
 eating is important  .  you are what you eat  .  it 's not only a daily routine  .  
 well  will you just go back to work after lunch  ?  
 no  .  i 'm going to pay the bill for the company 's lunch  .  
 but you did n't eat anything today  .  
 well  the bill is paid by month  .  that 's probably the only thing that i like about a takeout restaurant  .  
 all right  .  i 'm going to the mcdonald 's  .  
 for what  ?  i thought you did n't like western food  .  
 no  i never did  .  it 's for my son  .  he loves it  and i made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week  .  
 that 's really smart  .  my son daniel is the same with your son  .  i just do n't get it  why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food  .  
 me  either  .  but  it 's for sure that the children market is a really big one  .  
sandra is actually blue chipper  .  i do n't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women  .  
 that 's fate  .  
 i feel sorry for her  .  
how many cleaning ladies does your company hire  ?  
 we have two cleaning ladies  .  but both of them have received little education  .  
 most cleaning ladies are illiterate  .  but some of them do a very nice job  .  
good afternoon  madam  .  how can i help you  ?  
 well  i am a bit out of shape  .  i 'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit  .

 that depends  .  we offer membership for one month  half a year and one year  .  
 maybe one month  .  just have a try first  .  not too tough at the beginning  .  
do you have any hobbies  ?  
 yes  i like collecting things  .  
 oh  that  s interesting  and but what kind of things  ?  
 several things  for example  very coins  stamps  stones and so on  .  
 stones  ?  i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones  ?  
 yes  stones  .  
lisa  i 'm so glad to see you  .  how are you doing  ?  
 fine  .  i miss you so much  uncle benjamin  .  
 me too  .  we have n't seen each other for years  .  
 it 's been  years now  .  
 how time flies  !  now you are a college student out of a little girl  .  
 how is aunty shirley  ?  
 could n't be better  .  
 how has may been  ?  
hurry up  daniel  it 's barbie time  .  
 all right  sis  !  
 come on  it 's cool outside  .  
 i really wish mom and dad were here with us  .  
 hey  daniel  what 's your favorite weather  ?  snowy or sunny  ?  
 me  ?  er  i like hot weather  just like today  .  
 what  ?  are you crazy  ?  
 i like to watch barbie sticking her tongue out  .  
 ew  danny  gross  !  
 by the way  what 's your favorite weather  ?  
 i love snowy  because it is very very romantic  .  
it 's a lovely day  is n't it  ?  
 yes  the weather sure is nice today  .  
 i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch  ?  
 that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear  the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze  so it is not too hot  .  
 i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado  but i must admit  this sure is a nice spring day  .  
 hey  this spot in the shade looks really comfortable  .  
 okay . hey  is that a dark cloud over there  ?  do you think it will rain after all  ?  
 i do n't think so  .  i say the weather report last night  and it said the weather should be fine all day  .  
hey  .  i 'm a visitor from china  .  i love your music  .  it 's the best i 've ever heard  .  will you please spare a little bit of time for me  ?  
 sure  .  thank you for saying that  .  actually  those songs were sung for the first time today  .  i wrote them in the past two months  .  
 oh  you wrote them all by yourself  .  that 's amazing  !  are you a regular singer here  ?  
 you can say that  .  but my band and i also sing regularly in several other places  too  .  
 cool  .  your guitar skills are very impressive  .  how did you learn to play like that  ?  
 i picked up guitar at an early age  maybe around  years old  .  afterward  i taught myself by listening to some records of top players  .  
may  is the university a terrible place  ?  
 surely not  .  life in the university is fun  .  why did you ask  ?  
 because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam  .  so i figure you would study even harder after you  ve got in  .  
 studying in the university is not easy  but it 's not as arduous as you think  .  
 how do you know that  ?  you have n't got in yet  .  
 of course i know  .  i once attended lisa 's class  sitting quietly at the back of the classroom  .  
 oh  really  ?  were you not caught  ?  
 of course not  .  you are allowed to attend any lecture  only if there are empty seats for you and you do n't disturb the class  .  in universities  you study in a free and creative environment  .  
 what do you want to study in the university  ?  have you thought about it  ?  
 this question has really been bothering me  .  i like chinese literature  you know  .  but economics is really hot now  and it has a very good career prospect  .  
 i will choose what i like  .  you do n't know what a torture it is for me to study english  because i do n't like english  .  
 though i like chinese literature very much  i 'm also interested in economics  .  it 's a tough choice to make  .  
 you can decide later  .  you will have choices before you submit your university application form  .  
wow  there are so many lanterns to appreciate  .  now  i can see why it 's called the lantern festival  .  it deserves its name  .  
 yeah  .  people always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances  .  
 what are they doing over there  ?  people keep on gathering there  .  
 did you notice the characters on the lanterns  ?  
 sure  .  but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters  .  what do they say  ?  
 they are puzzles  .  it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival  .  
 very interesting  .  but i 'm afraid we 'd better do something else  .  hey  look  !  there is a huge lantern there  .  let 's get close to it  .  
 it 's really eyecatching  .  it 's the biggest dragon lantern i 've ever seen in all my life  .  
 really  ?  then i 'm really lucky  .  oh  it 's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth  .  
 very impressive  .  it 's made of glass which makes it even brighter  .  
 there are many chinese characters on its body  too  .  what are they about  ?  puzzles  ?  
dad  i want to learn how to drive this summer vacation  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  you 'd better hurry up before they 've filled all classes  .  many people are learning how to drive now  .  
 i will get registered now at once  .  do you know any training schools  ?  
 i am not sure  .  you can search for them on the internet  .  
 ok  .  look  i 've typed driver schools  and there are so many results coming out  .  
 let me see  .  teetee training school  summer program   yuan  learn how to drive within one month  and get driver 's license within three months  .  
  yuan is a little bit steep  .  
 i think so  .  let 's see the next one   yuan  summer program  .  forget it  .  
 i 've heard that the ideal life school is famous  .  they offer many programs and there are many classes available  .  the charge is also fair  .  
 search on the internet then  see if we can find something more about it  .  
 ah  got it  .  ideal life school  programs 
may  look  what 's that in the cage  ?  
 do n't you know that  ?  it 's panda  .  
 of course i know  .  i just ca n't see it very well  .  
 ok  then put on your glasses  and do you know what does the panda eat  ?  
 of course  bamboo  !  
 that 's right  .  
 i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship  .  
 you sound quite knowledgeable  .  
 not really  panda is my favorite animal  .  
 actually  it likes milk too  .  
 any way  in a word  panda is our friend  .  
 do you know other famous animals in the world  ?  
 yeah  let me think  the kangaroo and koala bear from australia are very famous  .  
daniel  have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary  ?  
 is that different from this kind of zoo  ?  
 yes  of course  .  
 so tell me about it  !  
 there are a lot of wild animals in that place  and also some special rules while visiting  .  
 special rules  ?  
 there  you only have two ways for visiting  .  
 details  ?  
 on their bus or in your own cars  and you wo n't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region  .  
 why not  ?  
 because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus  .  you can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be  .  
 that makes sense  .  but that sounds interesting  .  is there one in beijing too  ?  
 yes  .  
 i prefer to go there next time  .  
i 've heard the hitchhiker would be on next week  .  i want to see it  .  
 is it horror movie  ?  
 yeah  i love horror movies the most  .  would you like to go with me next weekend  ?  
 no way  .  i will be scared out of my wits  .  
 well  what kind of movies do you like  ?  
 er  let me see  .  romance  comedy  documentary  action  science fiction  cartoon and so on  .  
 in a word  you like all the movies except for the horror movies  .  
 yeah  it seems like we do n't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned  .  
 not quite  .  i also like romance and comedy movies very much  .  
 the terminal is a movie of this type  .  
 so we can relax now  .  
how time flies  !  
 may and danny have already grown up  .  
 i can still remember our first date  .  
 look at that big tree over there  .  
 yeah  oh my god  !  it 's still there  .  we have our first date right on there  .  
 do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight  .  
 you were dull at that time  .  
 but you agreed to go out with me at last  .  
look  forest gump is on at six thirty  .  
 really  ?  it was on in  for the first time  .  and it is really a classic  .  
 yeah  i am very impressed with tom hanks performance in the movie  .  
 i am also impressed with the lines in the movie  .  
 life is like a box of chocolates  you never know what you 're gonna get  .  
 that 's my favorite  .  
 you know  it also won  oscar awards in   .  unbelievable  !  
 it deserves  .  that film can give us a lot of inspiration  .  
 yes  the forrest 's experience can encourage the people in trouble  .  
 all in all  it will never lose its appeal  .  
 gucci  i have an idea  .  do you want to see this movie together  ?  
hey  may  .  how about getting together for a movie tonight  ?  
 sure  .  what 's playing  ?  
 well  let me check the newspaper  .  what about the terminal  ?  
 wow  it stars catherine zetajones  my favorite actress  .  
 well  birds of a feather flock together  .  i like her too  .  she was in a lot of dramas  .  
 she is so beautiful and elegant  .  and she is famous for her fine acting  .  
 what 's more  she does n't have scandals  .  and she likes to take part in the charitable activities  .  
 who is the director  ?  
 steven spielberg  .  another superstar  .  
 yes  a legend  also  .  i still remember  his movies  jurassic park and schindler 's list got him nine oscar awards in   .  
 can you introduce the story of the terminal briefly  ?  
 it tells a romantic and humorous love story  .  
hi  !  i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection  .  
 there  s so much i want to do  .  i  ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world  .  i just ran a search for music to download  .  
 i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit  .  
 thanks  .  that would be very helpful  .  i  ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want  .  there  s too much information on the net  .  
 when you sent your emails  did you attach any files to them  ?  
 yes  i did  .  there  s an antivirus program with my email account that scans all attachments  so i  m sure i haven  t sent anything nasty to anyone  .  
 when you use the internet  be careful not to give out your email address very often  .  if you do  you might get a lot of spamunwanted email from companies trying to sell you things  .  
 that  s good advice  .  i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself  such as my password and credit car number  .  
 that  s right  .  another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites  .  your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit  .  
 how do i do that  ?  
 take this web page for example  .  press the keys  control  and  d  together  .  click on  favourites  at the top of the screen  .  there you are  .  it has been added to you favourites list  .  if you click it  you will automatically go to that web page again  .  
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans  .  
 really  ?  i  m not sure that i would like all the attention  .  there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star  s private live in recent years  .  
 i love being photographed  !  if i were famous  i  d do interviews for all the top magazines  like cosmo and elle  .  
 i wouldn  t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice  but it would get tedious after a while  .  imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you  .  
 noone really believes gossip columnists  .  
 i think you  ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns  .  you  d also have to be very careful about every word you said  .  if you appeared on a chat show and said something silly  it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines  .  
 i think you  re right about that  .  i  d need a good manager to be my spokesperson  .  i could do a lot of charity work  which would help a lot of people  .  
 that  s a great idea  .  which charities would you support  ?  
 i love children  as you know  so probably a children  s charity  .  
 you  d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity  so you  d really need to be very careful  .  anyway  i  d be the first to buy your posters and i  d attend your first booksinging when you wrote your autobiography  .  
hi  !  is that the new laptop you brought last week  ?  it looks very nice  .  
 yes  it is  .  thanks  .  i  m just surfing on the internet  .  
 here  ?  in this cafe  ?  how can you do that  ?  
 this cafe offers a wireless internet connection  .  that means i can get on the net for free while i  m here  .  of course  i have to buy a cup of coffee  !  
 that  s great  .  can you do it anywhere  ?  
 no  .  you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection  .  there are only about  or  places that offer it in this city  .  
 so  what programs do you have on your laptop  ?  
 i  ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs  .  
 i know you are keen on photography  .  it  s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera  .  then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone  anywhere  at anytime  !  
do you use an antivirus program to protect your computer  ?  
 yes  i do  .  i also use an antispyware program and a firewall  .  there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users  .  you have to be very careful and keep you computer clean  .  
 how often do you run your antivirus program  ?  
 i usually run it every few days  .  it finds a virus about half the time  .  
 which antivirus program would you recommend  ?  
 how you tried this one  ?  it  s very good and you can download it for free on the internet  .  you can also download updates for free  .  
 that sounds very good  .  which website should i visit to download it  ?  
 just a minute  .  .  .  go to this one  .  i  ll send you an email with the line in it  .  it only takes a few minutes to download  .  then you have to go through the set up procedures  .  but they are not complicated  .  
 what do you use your computer for  ?  
 i use it for several thingssurfing the net  word processing and creating presentations  .  i don  t play many games on my computer  but i do a lot of work with photographs  .  using c computer program  you can edit and resize photographs  .  you can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones  .  
how often do you use the internet  ?  
 i use it almost every day  but i usually only use it to check my email  .  i don  t often surf the net  .  you use the internet a lot  don  t you  ?  
 yes  .  i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company  .  it can be frustrating when the connection is poor  .  
 so  you  re online eight hours a day  .  
 yes  i like the job though  .  sometimes  i help other people in the office if they  re having trouble online  .  
 how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information  ?  
 i think it  s fairly useful  but there are two big problems  .  first  a lot of the information you find online is false  .  second  when you buy something online  you don  t see it until you actually get it  .  
 how do you solve the website problems when you  re buying something online  ?  
what do you think are the main causes of war today  ?  
 i  d say the main reason is poverty  .  countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little  .  if their neighbors have some resources  they try to steal them by military force  .  
 it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars  .  people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country  .  
 several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years  .  it seems they will never end  .  
 how do you think they could be ended  ?  
 i don  t think that there is any easy way  .  the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country  .  at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate  .  the thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that  .  
 so  if the cause is poverty  there should be a program to make the country richer  .  if the problem is resources  share them  .  
 it sounds easy when you say it like that  .  in reality  it  s harder to make peace between countries  .  
 yes  .  it is  .  one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support  .  wars are very expensive  .  
it  s so relaxing  taking a walk in the country  .  the air is so fresh and clean  .  
 would you like to live in the country  ?  i  m not sure i  d like it  .  
 i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage  .  the problem is that  for me  each advantage has its own disadvantage  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 well  i hate the noise in the city  but i love being around lost of people  .  the problem is that you can  t have lots of people and have peace and quiet  .  the two just don  t go together  .  
 i see what you mean  .  i love being far away from a city  but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities  .  
 people can  t have it both ways  .  if you live in the country  it is often less convenient  .  if you live in a city  it is noisy  but there  s more to do  .  
 i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams  .  they  re so much better to look at than concrete  rows of parked cars and tall buildings  .  
 i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face  .  when the wind blows in the city  you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes  .  
 the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing  .  there  s so sign of pollution  .  the village looks so peaceful  .  
 just remember that in that village there  s nothing to do  .  there  s not even a pub or restaurant  .  there  s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods  .  
do you believe in god  ?  
 not at all  .  i  m an agnostic  .  do you  ?  
 i  m not sure  .  why don  t you believe there is a god  ?  
 i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one  .  
 i basically believe in science over theology  .  i mean  i believe in evolution for example  .  however  there are many things that science hasn  t explained yet  .  
 i  m sure that science will explain everything eventually  .  i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong  .  
 for example  ?  
 religions preach tolerance  but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics  .  
i can  t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice  !  
 why not  !  it  s a classic  .  in fact  it  s one of my favorite novels  .  
 but it  s so old  .  
 don  t judge a book by its cover  .  do you kwon what it  s about  ?  
 no  not at all  .  
 first of all  it  s a romance novel  set in the early th century  .  
 i didn  t realize it was a romance novel  .  what  s the main storyline  ?  
 it  s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls  .  
 why does he want to do that  ?  
 since he doesn  t have a son  he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man  .  that way  all of his daughters will be cared for  .  
 won  t they get his inheritance  ?  
 no  that  s the problem  .  though they are welloff  once he dies  his house will go to his cousin  .  so  when he dies  the girls will have nothing  .  
 i see  .  this sounds interesting  !  maybe my teacher isn  t so horrible after all  .  
 so  are you going to read the novel or watch the movie  ?  
 there  s movie  ?  my teacher didn  t tell me that  !  
 that  s probably because she wants you to read the book first  .  
 it would take a lot less time  .  .  .  
 how about this  .  when you finish the book  .  i  ll get the movie and watch it with you  .  
do you think children watch too much tv  ?  
 i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day  .  i don  t think that tv is bad for kids  .  i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes  .  
 perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch  .  they don  t do much else in their free time  .  at least they always do their homework first  .  
 if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch  remember to have something else for them to do  .  if you don  t  they  ll get bored and misbehave  .  
 they could go out and play with their friends  .  
 sure  .  you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time  .  
 perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing  .  he watches too much tv too  .  
do you like traveling  kathy  ?  
 i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance  .  but i don  t like traveling to work  waiting for buses  or  .  .  .  
 or getting stuck in traffic jams when you  re driving  .  
what 's your favorite book  ?  
 it 's gone with the wind  .  
 why do you like it best  ?  
 i enjoy the various characters and the plot  .  
 well  .  i like the thom birds best  .  
 is it very interesting  ?  
 sure  .  i like the writer 's language  too  .  
 if i have a chance  i 'll enjoy the book  .  
 would you like to go to the bookshop with me  ?  
what 's that book you have under your arm  ?  
 it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months  .  
 how in the world did you get a copy  ?  i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn  .  
 i checked it out of the rental library  .  it only costs five cents a day  .  
 is it really worth paying for  ?  
 i ca n't tell yet  .  i have n't got beyond the first chapter  .  
do you know much about computers  ?  
 not a great deal  .  
 i 've just been reading an article about them  .  they 'll be used for all sorts of things now  .  
 for accounting system and things like that  you mean  ?  
 yes  but they are used for other things  too  .  do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris  .  
 yes  ?  
 the man asked where we want to go  then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply  .  a few moment later  he gave us two tickets  .  
 of course  his machine must have been connected to a computer  .  
well  known  jim  i 'm  .  .  .  i 'm pretty much in favour of your computers  i think computers teach kids to think  because they require logical thoughts  .  
 but i  .  .  .  i do n't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids 'ability to thinkbecause kids do n't learn basic skills  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 they ca n't spell  they ca n't add  they ca n't subtract  they even do n't remember any more  .  that 's because they rely on gadgets  .  
um  which of them is the better typist  ?  
 well  mary types faster than jones  .  but i think jones types more carefully  .  
 is there any difference in their short hand  ?  
 jones can certainly take down letter more quickly  but mary  s short hand is the best in her class  .  
 how about languages  ?  
 both of them speak excellent french  .  but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does  .  
i  ve got a new boss  .  
 oh  what  s he like  ?  
 well  he  s got dark hair and brown eyes  .  
 yes  .  
 and a white sports car  .  
 um  that  s good  .  
would you like to come to our party  ?  
 i 'd like to  .  but i 'm not myself today  .  
 what happened  ?  you look so pale  .  
 it 's the end of the world for me  .  
 what makes you say that  ?  
 today  i 'm told i failed three courses  .  
 oh  that 's too bad  .  work harder next term  .  
 i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me  .  
 do n't loose heart  .  everything will be fine  .  
jenny  are you having fun here  ?  
 yes  of course  .  this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines  .  
 i  m glad you  re enjoying it  .  
 thank you for the invitation  .  
 it  s my pleasure  .  would you like another glass of champagne  ?  
would you like to come out with me tonight  ?  
 sorry  i can  t  .  
 tomorrow night  then  ?  
 i  d like to  .  but i  m afraid i can  t  .  
 i  m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then  .  
 that  s sounds great  .  
 ok  .  how about give me a ring  then  ?  
 no  .  i  d better not  .  
 why not  ?  
hey lydia  what are you reading  ?  
 i  m looking at my horoscope for this month  !  my outlook is very positive  .  it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic  and that i will have a passionate summer fling  !  
 what are you talking about  ?  let me see that  .  .  .  what are horoscopes  ?  
 it  s a prediction of your month  based on your zodiac sign  .  you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in  .  i was born on april th  so i  m an aries  .  when were you born  ?  
 january th  .  
 let  s see  .   .   .  you  re a capricorn  .  it says that you will be feeling stress at work  but you could see new  exciting developments in your love life  .  looks like we  ll both have interesting summers  !  
 that  s bogus  .  i don  t feel any stress at work  and my love life is practically nonexistent  .  this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense  .  
 no  it  s not  your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality  .  see  ?  it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize  .  
 well  you certainly match those criteria  but they  re so broad they could apply to anyone  .  what does it say about me  ?  
let  s play a game  !  
 ok  !  how about scrabble  ?  
 no  no  a friend of mine taught me this really fun game  .  i  m going to describe someone  s face  and you guess who it is  !  
 ok  !  
 let  s see  .  he has a roman nose  bushy eyebrows and dimples  !  
 our cousin pete  !  my turn  !  she has a pointy nose  sunken eyes and a mole on her chin  !  
 aunt rose  !  that mole is so huge  !  ok  my turn  .  he has a crooked nose and full lips  .  he has quite a few freckles and an oval face  .  oh  he is also bald  !  
 your future husband  !  
what are you doing  ?  
 what am i doing  ?  what am i doing  ?  don  t you know what day it is  ?  
 mumm  .  no  .  
 it  s only the day when the world  s biggest sporting event is kicking off  .  
 what  ?  
 the world cup  !  the first match is today  !  it  s mexico vs  .  south africa  !  it  s going to be a really good match  !  both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players  .  i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country  and all  .  
 i have no idea what you  re talking about  .  the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl  .  
 this is bigger than the super bowl  man  !  teams from  countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy  .  they first start in a group stage with bigger groups  each group having  teams  .  the top  teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals  .  
 sounds interesting  but soccer doesn  t really appeal to me  .  
 are you kidding  ?  over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup  !  it  s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport  !  each nation is cheering on their team  hoping they will become the next champion  .  so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt  they  re really good  !  
 all i know about soccer is that you can  t use your hands and that players are always falling down  trying to get a free kick or penalty kick  .  it seems like a sissy sport to me  !  
hey  !  how was your first day of class  ?  i  m in level two and i  m loving my class this semester  !  it  s great being in a class of international students  !  
 mine was ok  except that no one in my class speaks english  .  i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester  .  
 that  s both fortunate and unfortunate  .  it  s the united nations in my class  !  we have people from all over the world  !  there are three germans  a pole  a scottish  two french  an american  a brazilian  a chilean  a new zealander  though he prefers to call himself a kiwi  .  who else do we have  ?  oh  we also have a moroccan  a togolese  a pakistani  and two indonesians  !  
 that  s quite the array of nationalities  .  everyone in my class is from asia  except me  .  there are a few south koreans  several japanese  malaysian  thai  singaporean  filipino  kazakhstan  and one russian  .  
 well  i think you  re pretty lucky actually  .  you  ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture  .  
 i guess so  but i think it  s going to be hard to relate to my classmates  especially with the language barrier  .  i think i might change classes  .  
 don  t  !  stay the course  !  your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful  .  i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice  .  
 i highly doubt it  .  your girlfriend is chinese  .  
oh  george  what a beautiful day it is today  !  the sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there  !  what a perfect day to be at the beach  !  the kids are going to have so much fun  !  and we  ll be able to relax in the sun while they  re playing  .  
 it does seem like the perfect day  !  i  m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather  !  this looks like the perfect spot  !  ok kids  put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up camp  .  here  mary  help me lay down these beach towels  .  
 there we go  .  can you help me with the umbrella  ?  perfect  .  
 ok kids  here  sa beach ball and a frisbee  a pail and a shovel  .  i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave  .  don  t stray too far  .  wait  !  leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes  .  
 and stay in the shallow area  .  i don  t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar  !  it  s too deep out there and we didn  t bring your floatier  .  
 you  re back already  ?  the water was too cold  huh  ?  i  ll tell you a secret  .  do you see that small pool of water over there  ?  it  ll be warmer in there  .  go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows  .  
 what is that  ?  a jellyfish  ?  jeremy  put that down right now  !  it could sting you  !  
trina  will you marry me  ?  
 yes  !  yes  !  and yes  !  jared  of course i  ll marry you  !  
 oh  babe  i can  t wait to spend the rest of my life with you  !  i can  t wait for all the adventures we  re going to have  for all the fights and the laughter  .  i can  t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you  .  
 oh  jared  !  i can  t wait for our wedding  !  i hope you don  t mind  but i  ve already chosen a date  !  six months from now in the summer  !  melissa saw you buying the ring last month so i  ve had plenty of time to start planning  !  
 she what  ?  
 oh don  t worry  sweetie  i didn  t know when you were going to propose  .  it was still a nice surprise  !  as i was saying  i  ve got it all planned out  .  there  s almost nothing left to do  !  i wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending  .  
 four hundred  ?  
 no need to sweat it  .  my parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding  which is going to be lowbudget anyway  .  so roughly four hundred people  which means that the hall at northwoods heights will be our reception venue  .  i thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents  church and my uncle of course would be officiating  .  we  ll meet with him soon for some prewedding counseling  .  the music for the wedding ceremony was a nobrainer  .  my stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that  .  my cousin will be the official photographer  .  i thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo  .  did you know that she  s going to be a professional opera singer  ?  
 ah  .  .  .  
 and then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we  ll get the youth group to serve us  .  i was thinking that your friend  s band could be our entertainment for the night  .  though they might have to tone it down a bit  .  or we could hire a dj  .  your sister  s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings  .  what  s their name again  ?  i was thinking that we could have an island paradisethemed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like aquamarine  .  and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we  ll make our toasts  !  what do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors  ?  who else am i missing  ?  oh  your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake  !  
 wow  .  
 see  ?  it  s going to be wonderful  !  oh this wedding is going to be everything i ever dreamed of  .  
joanne  let  s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is  okay  ?  let  s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly  so we can go our separate ways  alright  ?  
 fine with me  .  i just want to get this over with  .  it  s important we make a clean break  .  i should have signed a prenup  .  
 what was that  ?  
 nothing  !  anyway  you  re right  there  s no reason this has to be nasty  .  my lawyer tells me you  ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property  as well as the custody agreementi keep the cat and you get the dog  .  so that  s done  .  .  .  finally  .  
 let  s not go there  joanne  !  ok  so let  s start with the record collection  i  ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back  .  
 fine  but i  m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me  .  
 i believe that was a wedding present to both of us  joanne  .  and you hardly ever use it  !  
 he  s my grandfather  and he never really liked you anyway  !  
 whatever  !  alright  i  ll concede the silly gramophone  if you  ll agree that i get the silver tea set  .  
 how typical  when are you ever going to use a silver tea set  ?  fine  !  i don  t want to drag this out any longer than necessary  .  what  s next  ?  what about these old photographs  ?  
 which ones  ?  let me have a look  .  wow  look at that  !  that brings back memories  .  .  .  that  ?  
 our trip to italy  !  i remember that day  .  we were going to visit the trev fountain  and we got caught in the rain  .  .  .  
  .  .  .  and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet  .  i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley  smiling and laughing in the rain  .  .  .  
 oh  we really did have fun back then  didn  t we  ?  
 oh  joanne  are we making a big mistake  ?  i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can  t reconcile and try again  ?  i still love you  .  
 oh jeff  !  i love you too  !  i  m so glad we didn  t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle  .  
woo hoo  !  this just might be the start of the rest of my life  !  
 what happened  ?  
 i  m in the market for a job  !  i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for  .  i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write  .  i  ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally  .  and you know i can be charming in interviews  .  goodbye my penniless days  !  hello salary and a career  !  
 ben  we  re fifteen  .  what kind of job are you looking for  ?  
 oh  just for a position as a gas station attendant  .  you know  starting at a simple lowly job  just like all the greats before they made it big in the world  .  
 uhhuh  .  
now that it  s the new year  i  ve decided to turn over a new leaf  .  
 yeah  ?  you finally decided to wipe the slate clean  ?  
 you got it  !  i have a new job  i  m living in a new city  with new friends  !  this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life  .  
 so what are you going to do  ?  take up an art class or something  ?  
 well  first of all  i  ve decided to stop smoking  .  it  s not that i  m pinching pennies or anything  it  s just that i  ve been smoking since i was sixteen  and i think it  s time to stop  .  
 i  m with you on that one  .  anything else you  re planning on doing  ?  
 one last thing  i  ve decided to come out of the closet  .  
bill  .  bill  !  you gotta help me  !  
 what  s wrong  ?  slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack  .  
 tomorrow is christmas and i haven  t bought my mom anything  !  i  m such a bad son  !  
 take it easy  !  let  s go to the mall  window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like  .  
 that  s just it  !  i don  t know what to get her  !  last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small  !  i suck at getting presents for people  .  
 that  s where you  re making a big mistake  !  you can  t just guess peoples  likes or sizes  !  especially with clothes or jewelry  .  on top of that  i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her  .  at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like  !  
 yeah  you  re right  .  when it comes down to it  i can be pretty tacky  .  
 yeah  tell me about it  .  i know  !  your mom is trying to learn spanish  right  ?  why don  t you get her a gift certificate for this great website i saw called spanishpod  .  
now  david  can i get you a drink  ?  what will you have  ?  
 coffee  please  .  
 what about you  mary  ?  
which do you like better  orange or lemon  ?  
 i like orange better  .  
 why  ?  
what would you like to do tonight  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 what about going to a movie  ?  
mary  today is a great day for you  .  
 how nice of you to remember  !  
 oh  here 's a little token of my affection  .  
hello  jack . it s good of you to come  .  
 the pleasure is mine . happy birthday and many happy returns of the day  !  
 thank you  jack . to be frank  i 'd rather forget my birthday  .  
where do you spend the weekend  ?  
 we 've a country house  .  
 that 's nice  .  
 join us  will you  ?  
how about doing shopping this weekend  ?  
 what 're you going to buy  ?  
 sportshoes . will you go with me  ?  
paul  let 's go and see grandpa this afternoon  .  
 but grandpa will be working  .  
 it 's saturday  .  
are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon  ?  
 it depends on the weather  .  
 the radio says it 'll be fine  .  
i can see you 've got some color back in your cheeks  .  
 yes  i find jogging does good to me  so i keep on doing it  .  
 you 've formed a sound habit  .  
i wonder if you agree that money is not happiness  .  
 i do n't entirely agree with you  .  
 then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide  ?  
let 's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at mall cinema . betsy told me it 's a beautiful love story and i should n't miss it  .  
 oh  goodness  please not again . that s what we did last week  .  
 no  we did n't  .  last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness  .  
 right  it was a chick flick  just like this one  so what 's the difference  ?  besides  this is the last week for the third movie in destroyer series and i want to see that on a big screen  .  action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen  .  
 oh  yeah  and i did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week . but you liked that movie  did n't you  ?  
 oh  sure  it was great  .  i had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a twohour nap  .  
 it was n't that bad  and you 're the one that insisted on skipping dinner . we went to an excellent restaurant  .  
 that place does n't have a single meat dish . just fish and shellfish and you know i do n't like fish that much  .  
 and i do n't like meat that much . the only meat i eat is chicken  .  
 but when i pick the restaurant  we go to a place that has both chicken and fish  .  i always respect your food preferences  .  
 well  i suppose that  to be fair  you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat  .  
who 's your favorite film star  ?  
 tom hanks is always my favorite film star  .  
 what films feature him  ?  
which is your preference  tea or coffee  ?  
 my choice would always be tea  .  
 when did you form this hobby  ?  
have you started your report yet  ?  
 i 'm having a hard time getting the information  .  
 it 's easy  .  you only have to search the internet in order to get the information you 're looking for  .  
hey  !  what 's up  ?  
 hi  john  !  i have n't seen you for ages  .  
 yeah  i 've been out of town  .  
 so how have you been  ?  
oh  it 's getting late  .  i 've got to run  .  it was nice talking to you  karren  .  
 thanks  tim . nice meeting you  too  .  
 i guess we 'll see just around  .  
 ye  i hope so . well . take it easy  .  
hi  sue  .  what 's up  ?  
 hey  andrew  .  how 's everything with work  ?  
 ok  i guess  .  my boss has been on my back recently  .  
 really  ?  what 's he been doing  ?  
 you know  just giving me lots to do  .  i 'm really busy right now  .  
 are you  ?  what are you busy with  ?  
i 'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys  .  
 but you promised to play chess with me this afternoon  .  
 yeah  but that was before the guys ask me to join the team  .  
 so what  ?  
 you know how much i want to be on the team  and now there is an opening for me . if i do n't go to practise today . they ll get someone else and i 'll miss my chance  .  
 i do n't care about baseball . you know i need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if i washed the dishes for you last sunday  and i did  .  
 i know  and i will  .  
 when  ?  
 after baseball practice  .  
 and then  it 'll be dinner time  then homework  and then your show is on . you are going to break your promise  .  
 no  i wo n't  .  i 'm going to skip tv tonight and work on your chess game with you if that 's ok with you  .  
 well  i 'd rather do it the way we set up . but if you promise to give me your best game  it 's ok with me  .  
i think andy 's party will be fun  .  
 yeah  i think so  .  oh  by the way  i need to ask you something  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 could i get back the sweater you borrowed  ?  
 sure  .  oh  that reminds me  .  could i borrow your black leather boots  ?  
so  where are you going to spend your winter vacation  ?  
 oh  i  m going to meet my girlfriend in thailand  .  
 you have a girlfriend in thailand  ?  interesting  .  how come i have never heard of that  ?  
 actually it will be my first time to meet her  .  
 you mean you haven  t seen her before  ?  then  how could she be your girlfriend  ?  maybe you don  t even know her  .  
 that  s true  .  but we have known each other over the internet for a few months now  .  actually we are on an intimate level  .  we even plan to be engaged next month  .  
 congratulations  !  it  s good to follow your heart  .  but i just didn  t expect to be so fast  .  
 the internet is making interaction much faster  .  people are getting to know each other much more quickly this way  .  
lili  let  s take a vacation  !  
 george  how can we  ?  vacations cost money  .  and this month we don  t have much money left after paying the rent  .  
 well  lili  we can visit different places in the state in our van   .  we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time  .  trust me  it won  t cost much  .  
 where will we sleep  then  ?  
 in the van  .  
 what about other expenses  ?  
 let  s see  .  gas  food  recreation  we won  t spend much  .  come on  .  don  t hesitate  .  we need to get out of the house once in a while  .  we have been working hard  haven  t we  ?  
 maybe you  re right  .  when do you plan to go  ?  
 the sooner the better  !  i can  t wait  !  
 oh  i don  t know where we  re going yet  .  
 as long as we  re going  you can decide where to go  .  i trust your judgments  .  i know you miss chinese food  so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time  .  
 let  s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field  !  
how is your job search going  janet  ?  
 i found the ideal position  .  i  m working for a plumbing company  .  
 are you serious  ?  you studied mathematics at college for four years  and now you have a job working with your hands  !  
 plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge  and creativity  .  i love this job  .  
 i can see that  .  but i didn  t know you had experience in that line of work  .  
 i didn  t  but i applied for an apprenticeship  and since i studied math  and i have a good attitude  my application was accepted  .  
i can  t wait to retire  .  
 and then what  ?  
 and then i  m moving to florida where i can play golf all day  every day  !  
 that sounds boring to me  .  
 what do you plan on doing after you retire  ?  
 yes  i think i will do something new  .  i  ve always wanted to be a teacher  .  i  m willing to begin studying to teach  .  
how good are you at sports  bill  ?  
 are you kidding  ?  i  m terrible  !  but i love to watch sports  .  i go to football or baseball games a lot  .  and i read sports magazines every week  .  
 wow  !  
 do you like sports  janice  ?  
 oh  yes  .  i like to exercise  .  but i don  t watch sports or buy sports magazines  .  i don  t have much time to do those things  .  
 oh  i see  .  you know  we spend time doing different sports  .  how much time do you spend exercising  ?  
 well  i guess i exercise about two hours a day  .  i do aerobics three times a week  and the other days i play badminton  with my husband  .  i always feel good afterward  .  
 that  s great  !  i  ve heard people say that before  .  
 well  why don  t you try to get some exercise  ?  it  s difficult  but very rewarding  .  
so do you believe in palmistry  ?  
 palmistry  ?  what is that  ?  
 it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm  to tell the future  .  
 oh  you mean palm reading   .  i 've seen that before  but i do n't believe in it  .  
 are you sure  ?  i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm  .  do you want me to take a look at your hand  ?  
 really  ?  you 've read books about it  ?  ok  then  .  but only if you want to  .  
 ok  let 's see  well  you 've got a long life line  which is good  and the love line is strong  .  .  .  
 what else do you see  ?  will i be successful  ?  will i make a lot of money  ?  
 hmm  hard to say  wait  yes  it looks like you will do well in business  and your ambition will help you a lot  but  .  .  .  
 what  ?  what is it  ?  what 's the matter  ?  
 you seem to have a large gullibility line  .  you believe everything that you 're told  .  
so  jack  do you believe in ghosts  ?  
 no  not really  .  why do you ask  ?  
 because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost  .  
 you saw a ghost  ?  when  ?  
 it was many years ago  when i was a little child  .  it was the middle of the night  and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen  .  i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs  when  .  .  .  
 so that 's where you saw the ghost  ?  in your house  ?  what did it look like  ?  was it hideous  ?  
 it was a big  green thing that looked like a person  .  it was in the kitchen  and it slowly moved towards the stairs  .  .  .  
 so what did you do  ?  
 i hid so that it could n't see me  .  slowly it got closer and closer  until  .  .  .  
 until what  ?  what happened  ?  did you see it clearly  ?  did it attack you  ?  
what 's the matter  lisa  ?  you do n't look too good  .  
 i just found out that my husband is cheating on me  .  
 you mean mark  ?  he seems like such an honest guy  .  
 that 's what i thought  .  it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months  .  
 two months  ?  how did you find out  ?  
 i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang  .  i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark  .  she then asked if i was his sister  and i said no  i was his wife  .  she hung up immediately  .  
 so you asked him about the girl who called  ?  
 yeah  he first said it was someone from work  .  he gave me a lame excuse  and so i pressed him on it  .  
 what 'd he do  ?  
 he kept trying to make stupid excuses  and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion  .  
 indiscretion  ?  how can an indiscretion last two months  ?  i mean  you two have been married for two years  !  how can he do that to you  ?  
 i told him i would divorce him if he wouldn  t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her  .  
i don  t understand why you always look so happy  so energetic  .  it seems like you  ve got good news everyday  .  
 really  ?  do i look happy all the time  ?  
 all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers  .  
 oh  do you know why  ?  actually  it  s easy  .  because i always exercise  .  my exercise  i think  is very hard  .  i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties  .  i feel alive  !  
 oh  i know  .  i saw you doing pullups one time on the campus  and some students trying to imitate you  .  
 yeah  they are doing it for fun  .  seldom would people like my exercise  .  it  s difficult and boring  .  
 it  s true  .  many students do the exercise when they have to  .  we have p  .  e  .  once a week  .  
 but i think chinese students need to exercise more  .  besides exercise will help them learn new things better  .  don  t students want to have a good memory  ?  
 of course  .  i didn  t know that  .  i only know exercise makes bodies stronger  .  i should take some exercise then  .  do you have any suggestions  ?  
 well  do what you like to do  .  it can be anything  .  jogging  doing aerobics  going bicycling  and playing pingpong  .  absolutely anything  .  doing three or more workouts a week is good for you  .  but remember to do some stretches first  .  
hey  what 's new  ?  
 not much  .  just sitting here eating some chinese food  .  is that the paper  ?  why do n't you open it and tell me my horoscope  ?  
 ok  wait a minute  .  .  .  let 's see  .  i 'm a taurus  and it says  mars is in the third house  and is soon to eclipse venus  .  i do n't know what that means  but then it says  your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking  .  remember to be positive  .  sounds good to me  .  
 what about gemini  ?  what 's the prediction  ?  
 since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter  your fortunes are falling  .  bad luck will follow you today  and you will lose that which you value  .  be careful  .  
 that sounds bad  !  i 'm really worried  what should i do  ?  maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day  .  
the acting of this film is marvelous . in spite of the thin plot  the acting  the music and the scene have won the academy award of this year  .  
 i 'm sorry for hero  .  i dont think there 's any excuse for his acting in some parts  .  
i plan to buy a car this year  .  
 how do you pay for it  ?  
 i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments  .  
going to the cafeteria  ?  
 no  i am not eating there anymore  .  i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner  .  the food served in the cafeteria is not my type  .  i am a total meat lover  .  but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian  .  they have been serving the chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days  .  haven  t you noticed that  ?  
 that  s fine with me  .  i don  t hate vegetables and i don  t eat much during lunch  .  
how was your education going on in australia  ?  
 i 'm going to graduate this summer  .  
 where are you going to work then  in australia or back in china  ?  
 i 'm planning to return to china after graduation  .  
 why are you choosing to leave a foreign country  ?  many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad  .  
 well  i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment  .  
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work  ?  
 of course  !  it is the no  .   stressor in my life  .  you know job stress has become a very common problem these days  .  so we must learn to cope with it  .  
 totally agree  .  what is your solution  ?  
 well  there are two causes of job stress  .  one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition  .  so if we want to manage job stress  both we and the companies should do something  .  for me  i am trying to balance work and leisure time  .  you know  all work and no play make jack a dull boy  .  
 you seem to have a very relaxed outlook  .  
 it is necessary  .  positive attitude helps to prevent stress  .  
 but i don  t think we can change our working condition  .  anyway  we are not the bosses  .  
do n't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted  ?  
 yes  at first i felt very awkward  .  after bill was demoted and then resigned  it was kind of like somebody died  !  i mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something  .  and then i was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to  .  .  .  
 did they mutiny  ?  
 thankful  no  .  i guess everyone understands the opportunity i had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career  .  i 'm really moving up the ladder now that i 'm considered a supervisor  .  after a couple weeks  it was like nothing happened  .  
 it is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work  .  supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them  .  
mary  how was your date with john  ?  
 it 's ok  .  it seems we have a lot in common  .  
 oh  really  .  that is great news  .  what does he look like  ?  
 he is tall and slim  fairhaired  .  
 sounds like he is pretty cute  .  what do you think of him  ?  
i heard through the grapevine that michael probably become the new sales manager  .  
 how did you get wind of the rumor  ?  
 i am not a rumor monger  .  
i am not sure what to do during the holidays  any suggestions  ?  
 well  going to a cinema  visiting the galleries  exhibitions and museums  finding and meeting old friends  exercising in the health club or mountain biking  .  there are so many good choices  .  
 the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun  .  i just don  t know what to do first  .  
 why not start with the most interesting one  ?  
 actually  i  m interested in all of them  .  the more choices we have  the harder to make a decision  .  
ella  it 's been such a long week  .  i 'm ready to go out and party  .  hey  let 's go out for a night on the town  .  
 gosh  you took all the word right out of my mouth  .  let 's go out and get crazy tonight  .  
 let 's go to the new club on west street  .  
 sure  but what do i wear  ?  
how do i look in this new dress  ?  
 you  d better change it  .  it  s ugly  .  
 how about this one  ?  
thanks for the pizza  .  it was delicious  .  
 it 's okay  .  
 next time  it 's on me  .  
 do n't be silly  .  
 i 'm serious  .  
 alright  .  next time  we can try some other flavors  .  
 certainly  .  the vegetarian pizza looks pretty good  .  it must be very delicious  .  
i remember you said that you like china because it has cheap beers  .  
 yes  unbelievably cheap  .  carlsborg is less than    .  
 why do you drink  ?  i mean  where does drinking get you  ?  
 it 's fashionable  .  
 come on  you do n't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity  .  
 mary  it 's not about the blind following  .  what matter is i enjoy in drinking  .  it 's like when you get off of work  .  you 're so tired  .  you need to get relaxed  .  you ca n't just turn on the tv and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep  .  you need to make your after work time more fun  .  
 how  ?  by drinking  ?  
 drinking is just part of it  .  i mean  you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun  .  you drink and talk  .  and the more you drink  the more you talk  .  it makes me so relaxed  .  
 when did you begin to drink  ?  
 it 's a long time ago  .  when i first went to a bar to pick up girls there  i saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke  .  then i went up to her and said can i buy you a drink  ?  
 and then  ?  
 then i talked to her and got her number  .  you know what  ?  when you do n't know what to say  ?  just drink  .  
who is it  ?  
 open the door  .  it 's me  .  i ca n't find the key  .  
 you 're always so careless  .  
 oh  thank you  .  i am exhausted  .  will you bring me a cup of tea  ?  
 okay  but i have n't prepare supper  .  
 so let 's eat out  .  
 what do you want to eat  ?  
 noodles  .  how about you  ?  
if i can improve my vertical jump a few more inches  i think beach volleyball might be my ticket  .  
 but whenever we play  you just sit on the sand  drink beer  and watch the girls  !  
 it 's a beautiful sport  is n't it  ?  
 to be honest  i do n't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch  !  
you 've heard of bruce jenner  have n't you  ?  
 he won the decathlon in the  olympics  right  ?  
 i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles  .  
 i can think of better things to dream about  .  .  .  
 sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat  with his legs pumping away  .  
are you ready  honey  ?  
 sorry  not yet  !  can you help me to select the dress  ?  i don  t what i should wear to fit thinner party  .  
 just dress formal  .  
 how about transom  ?  
 it is too loud  we  ll handle some official business first before the dinner  .  
 oh  i nearly forget it  .  
which season do you like best  ?  
 i like spring best  .  it is neither too cold nor too hot  .  freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier  .  how about you  ?  
 i prefer summer  especially the summer evenings  .  when the sun comes down  it is so nice to take a walk and breathe  .  after a rain shower  the smell of the air is refreshing  .  it is also a best reason for icecream  .  
 how do you get through the stuffy daytime  ?  
i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year  what do you say  ?  
 fantastic  !  i enjoy clubbing  especially those clubs with live bands  .  the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad  full of smoke  and the music is too loud  so conversations are not really possible  .  once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette  .  
 how did that happen  ?  
 a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it  .  if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face  .  
would you like to have dinner with me tonight  ?  
 sorry  i have to work overtime  .  
 you are really career minded  .  
did you watch the volleyball match last night  ?  
 yeah  .  
 who won  ?  
 china  .  
 what is the score  ?  
 china beat brazil three to zero  .  
bob  !  
 anne  !  i have n't seen you for ages . how ve you been  ?  
 fine  just fine . and you  ?  
 not bad . it really is great to see you again . where have you been  ?  
let  s go to wangfujing by bus  .  
 better take the subway  .  it  s faster and more convenient  .  
 okay  .  it will be a new experience for me  .  
 we have a rather comprehensive subway system here  .  we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway  .  especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy  .  
 where do we pay the fare  ?  
 just give the man standing there three yuan and he 'll give you a token  .  then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in  .  
 let me pay for it  .  
 where can i get the subway madam  ?  
 ask the worker who sells token to give you one  .  it  s free of charge  .  actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations  .  
 do i have to pay additional fare to change train  ?  
well  sir  we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant  .  
 is that so  ?  i did n't know it . can i possible borrow a jacket and a tie  ?  
 i 'm sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie  .  
 then we return to the hotel and come back . will you change the appointment  ?  
 certainly . what time will you come back  ?  
 at seven  please  .  
 how many in your party  ?  
 a party of three  .  
so click here  then up to the top  .  
 er  .  .  .  hum  .  .  .  got it  .  
 then open that window . yeah  that one  .  
 right  !  
 and that 's it  .  you 're done  .  
excuse me  is this seat taken  ?  
 i  m afraid this seat is taken  .  
 oh  .  is it  .  thank you anyway  .  
 you  re welcome  .  why don  t you ask the conductor when he comes by  ?  
wow  !  what happened to you  ?  you look sad  .  
 i just lost my job  .  my boss just told me  .  
 that 's unbelievable  .  why did this happen  ?  
 i do n't understand of myself  .  it seems they have to save money  .  
oh  it 's getting late  .  i 've got to run . it was nice talking to you  karren  .  
 thanks  tim . nice meeting you  too  .  
 i guess we 'll see just around  .  
 ye  i hope so . well . take it easy  .  
hi  tim  any news about your job interview  ?  
 yeah  i did n't get the job in the end  .  
 oh  what a pity  !  
hi joe  .  you met my new assistant  right  ?  
 emm  .  .  .  yes  .  but i was n't too impressed  .  i found her a little stuck up  .  
 you are kidding  but she 's so helpful  .  
 tom  .  .  .  you are her boss  you kown . of course  she 's helpful to you  .  
 come on  .  she 's like that with everyone  .  
you have a lovely house  jack  .  
 thank you  .  but a number of things have been going wrong lately  .  
 that 's too bad  .  what problems are you having  .  
 oh  the whole house needs repainting for starters  .  the carpet in the living room is worn out  and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting  .  last week  i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet  .  anyway  all par for the course when you own a house  i guess  .  i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over  .  
 i  ve studied home decoration as a hobby  .  could i make some suggestions  ?  
 go right ahead  .  
 well  i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room  and maybe some new drapes for the windows  .  also  a grandfather clock would look great in the den  .  perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 well  you really do have a talent for this  alice  .  thanks for the suggestions  .  
tom  did you see the film last night  ?  
 yes  i did  i thought it was a failure  .  
 do you really think so  ?  i do n't think so  .  it was n't that bad film at all  .  did n't you hear the applause of the audience  ?  
 well  maybe so  .  but i still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion  .  
hello  !  
 oh  hi  !  
 please allow me to introduce myself  .  my name is tom  .  
 pleased to meet you  .  my name is alice  .  did you just move in next door  ?  
 yes  i did  .  have you lived here long  ?  
 me  ?  i guess so  .  i 've lived here for about six years now  .  have you lived in america very long  ?  
 no  not really  .  when i left vietnam  i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years  .  where do you work  alice  ?  
 i teach mathematics at a college  .  what do you do  ?  
 i am an accountant at a company

 it 's nice meeting you too  alice  .

ms anderson  my name is mike  .  i am division chief of abc company  .  welcome to toronto  .  
 thank you  .  it 's a pleasure to meet you  .  
 a pleasure meeting you as well  the flowers are for you  .  
if you wanna keep healthy  you must give up smoking  .  it 's extremely bad for your health  you know  .  
 i know it 's not good for me  but the problem is i just ca n't help it  .  
 well  i 've got an idea  put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes  and read it before you smoke  .  it may give you a feeling to reduce it  .  
you look run down  brian  .  
 i 've been feeling under the weather recently  .  i caught a bad cold last week  and i still have n't got over it  .  
 well  you wanna take a sick leave  ?  all you need now is a good  long rest  .  
 i guess so  .  even though i seem to be over the worst of it  .  i do n't want to give the bug to anyone in the office  .  
please do excuse me for a moment  .  i 've got diarrhea  .  
 it 's easy to get loose bowels in summer  .  
 it may have something to do with the food i had last night 
 you  ve got to be careful on the food you eat  .  
steve  you look pale  .  what happened  ?  
 i did n't sleep a wink last night  .  
 did you have something on your mind  ?  you look so concerned  .  maybe i can help you  .  
 well  i am under a lot of pressure  .  my boss is very pushy  .  he assigned me three projects  .  now the deadlines are near  and i still have not finished all of my projects  .  
 is there anything i can do to help you  ?  
hi  robert  .  what happened to your face  ?  it looks swollen  .  
 i had to go get a cavity filled today  .  
 did it hurt  ?  
 i do n't even wanna talk about it  .  it killed me  !  
 how long were you in the chair  ?  
 it took quite a while  but the worst part was getting numbed  .  they had to give me  shoots  .  
 well  i guess you 've learned a good lesson  huh  .  you have to take good care of your teeth  .  
 no kidding  .  not only can  t i stand the pain  but man  .  .  .  dentists are expensive  .  the bill is going to be humungous  !  
 do n't you have a dental insurance  ?  
man  they take a lot of our paycheck  .  
 yeah  the government really takes a bit  does n't it  ?  
 seriously  .  the only tax i do n't mind them taking is social security  .  it 's only a few dollars every paycheck  .  
 yeah  i do n't mind it either  .  we  ll both end up rich slobs and not need it  but what if we do  you know  ?  
 yeah  .  it wo n't be much  but at least we  ll have a monthly check when we get old  .  
 yeah  my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive  .  
 let 's just hope the politicians do n't figure out a way to spend it  .  
have you seen any good movies lately  ?  
 it 's ages since i went to see a film  .  
 why  ?  you were a real movie buff when you were a student  .  
good afternoon  would you mind if i sit here  ?  
 of course not  .  
 i  m jack  .  what  s your name  ?  
 laura  .  
 do you like this place  ?  
 i don  t think it  s very nice  .  and my father doesn  t like it  .  but my mother likes it very much  .  so we often come here  .  
 how often  ?  
 well  we come here almost every month  .  
 who  s that  ?  
 it  s my mother  .  she  s fond of swimming  .  and the man beside her is my father  .  
 do you like swimming  ?  
jill  how do you like your new job  ?  
 i like it  .  but how did you know about my new job  ?  i wanted to surprise you  .  
 i just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town  .  you can still fill me in on tile details  .  
 well  two weeks ago i got a tip about a possible job opening at ace travel agency over on franklin avenue  .  
 sure  i think i know the place  .  
 well  anyway  i made a beeline over to their office  had an interview with the manager  and was told to start work the next day  .  
 that  s really great  jill  .  so  what do you do there exactly  ?  
 right now i  m basically just a secretary  but if i  m given the chance  i want to become a travel agent there  .  
 don  t tell me your  re already bucking for a promotion  .  
 no  of course not  .  i  ve got a lot to learn yet  .  in the meantime  i just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone  s toes  .  
what would you like to have in your breakfast  bread  egg or sandwiches  ?  
 bread  .  
 and milk or orange juice  ?  
 orange juice  .  
 what would you like for lunch  pork  mutton or beef  ?  
 i think mutton is best  .  
 what kind of drink do you like most  red wine  beer or champagne  ?  
 i like champagne  .

 banana of course  .

hi bob  how  s business  ?  
 just okay  .  
 okay  enough small talk  .  let  s get down to business  .  
 good idea  .  
 since we  re good friends  you do n't have to pay me  .  
what sort of things do you grow in your garden  ?  
 i grow a variety of things  so that something is in bloom all year round  .  
 when is your garden at its best  ?  
the may day holiday is coming  .  have you made any plan  ?  are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling  ?  
 i haven  t decided yet  .  but i may go out  .  
 where have you planned to go  ?  
 i want to go to shanghai  but i also want to visit hainan  .  
 then which will be your first choice  ?  
 i don  t know  .  how about you  ?  are you staying here or somewhere  .  
 i have decided to go to tasha  .  
 by train or by plane  ?  
is there something wrong  ?  you look so sad  .  
 my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture  .  
 no wonder you look so upset  .  have you called the police  ?  
people say that you never have a real winter in the south china  but i do n't think so  .  
 why  ?  
 i did experience a winter with snow in kunming  the spring city  .  
well  speak of the devil  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i was just thinking about you the other day  .  
it 's a lovely day out today  is n't it  ?  
 it 's beautiful  .  enjoy it while it lasts  .  it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow  .  
 what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow  ?  
 it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain  .  
 that does n't sound pretty  .  
 do you have any plans for tomorrow  ?  
 well  i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends  .  
 you might want to change your plans  .  with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow  the roads are going to be rather slippery  .  
 i suppose i should  .  i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions  .  do you have any plans for tomorrow  ?  
 i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon  .  
 if you 're lucky  it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day  !  
 if that happens  then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies  .  
 that sounds like fun  .  
 hey  look outside  !  it 's started to drizzle  !  
hi  charlie  are you busy this evening  ?  
 sorry  i 'm afraid that i 've got plans tonight  .  
 what are you doing  ?  
 i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday  .  
 how old is he today  ?  
 it 's his th birthday  .  
 well  wish him a happy birthday for me  .  
 sure thing  .  what are your plans for the evening  ?  
 i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight  .  
 well  if you can wait until tomorrow night  i 'll go with you then  .  
 sorry  i 've got people coming over tomorrow night  .  
 sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us  .  
 sounds that way  .  maybe some other time then  ?  
 sure . hey  i 'm sorry  but i 've got to get going  .  
 yeah  me  too  .  it 's about time i made a move  .  
 say hello to your friends for me  .  
 likewise  .  see you later  .  
what are you listening to  ?  is that beethoven or mozart  ?  
 it 's beethoven  .  do you like it  ?  
 i think beethoven's music is incredible  .  i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent  too  .  do you believe that  ?  
 i do n't know about that  but i do think that it helps people relax  .  
 what other kind of music do you listen to  ?  
 actually  i mostly just listen classical music  .  what about you  ?  
 to be honest  i think classical music is too complicated for me  .  
 what kind of music do you prefer then  ?  
 i like pop music  .  do you  ?  
 not really  .  i do n't think pop music has much depth  .  
 i see what you mean  .  i think that 's way i like it so much  .  
 how long have you been in to pop music  then  ?  
 i 've always been into it  .  have you always liked classical music  ?  
 not really  .  when i was little  we did n't really listen to music at all  .  
 so  how did you become interested in it  ?  
 well  when i was about  years old  i started playing the piano  .  i think that 's how it all started  .  
 do you still play piano  ?  
shall we go to cinema this evening  ?  the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing  .  it  s supposed to be really good  .  
 what kind of movie is it  ?  i don  t like many of his movies  actually  .  
 it  s a thriller  .  it has julia roberts playing the female lead  .  
 i like thrillers and i like julia roberts  so it might be interesting  .  i read a review today and the critic didn  t seem to be very impressed  .  
 what did the critic say  ?  
 he didn  t say it was bad  but he said that it wasn  t as good as it could have been  particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it  .  
 the movie starts at eight o  clock  so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready  .  
 good  .  dinner is nearly ready and i  d like to watch the news before we go  .  the oscars were last night and i want to see the results  .  
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching  ?  
 i like current affairs programmes and documentaries  especially wildlife ones  .  how about you  ?  
 i like those kinds of programmes too  .  they  re very informative  .  i think that many people underrate the education value of tv  .  
 i agree  .  people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence  .  
 yeah  .  and that  s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational  !  
 right  .  you can  t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes  .  they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes  .  
 in my country  there  s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown  .  i think it  s about six minutes per hour  .  
 that  s great idea  .  but don  t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that  ?  
 no  .  they don  t  .  they simply charge higher prices at peak times  .  is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country  ?  
 not as far as i know  .  we have so many advertisements  .  the interruptions are unbearable sometimes  !  that  s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv  where you pay a fixed amount each mo 
 some people have satellite and cable tv in my country  but people don  t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes  .  besides  the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes  .  
what  s the plot of your new movie  ?  
 it  s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders  .  i play the part of the detective  .  he has to catch the killer  but there  s very little evidence  .  it  s a psychological th 
 did you enjoy making the movie  ?  we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director  .  
 i have had disagreement with every director  .  i  ve worked with  .  we  ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences  .  it was the same when i made this movie  .  i don  t no 
 critics are not very happy with the movies that you  ve made recently  .  does that bother you  ?  
 not at all  .  the feedback from audience has been great  .  i care about what they think more than what the critics think  .  
 did you do you own stunts in the movie  ?  
 i wanted to  but my insurance company wouldn  t let me  .  all of my stunts were done by a stuntman  .  as you know  i used to do my own stunts  but i  ll leave that to the experts in future  .  
 thank you very much for doing this interview  .  
 my pleasure  .  have you seen the movie yet  ?  
what did you do over the weekend  ?  
 i went a global warming rally in london  .  it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment  .  
 do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already  ?  
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves  but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening  .  
 like what  ?  
 well  we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start  .  
 what else can we do to protect the environment  ?  
 if you do have to drive  you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol  .  also  your home should use sources of renewable energy  .  
 how about recycling  ?  does that actually help  ?  
 yes  .  you should take your glass  paper  plastic  cardboard  and tin cans to a recycling center  .  
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future  ?  
 i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone  .  
 i had no idea you were such as environmentalist before  !  
have you ever been in an earthquake  ?  
 yes  i experienced one when i was in tokyo once  .  the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over  .  
 do you know where it measured on the richter scale  ?  
 i do n't remember  but it was n't very serious  .  have you ever been in an earthquake  ?  
 no  but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger  .  
 where are you from  ?  
 i 'm from the plains of the midwest  .  it 's a prime location for tornadoes  .  
 did your house ever get damaged from the winds  ?  
 most of the time we were lucky  but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room  .  
 wow  that must have really been scary  .  
 actually  some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass  .  
 have you ever experiences a flood  ?  
 no  but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once  .  it actually happened the day after he bought the car  !  
how are you doing  ?  
 i 'm ok  .  i wish i could say the same for my friend  .  
 what happened to him  ?  
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving  .  
 was it his first offence  ?  
 unfortunately not  .  he was charged with a dui when he was in university  .  
 what happened to him then  ?  
 not much  it was a minor offence back then  .  he got away with a fine of    .  
 did they take his license away  ?  
 no  they were really easy on him  .  the problem is that that was a long time ago  .  they are much tougher on crime now  .  
 what do you think will happen to him  ?  
 well  he 'll definitely lose his license  pay a fine  and maybe even spend some time in jail  .  
 that does n't sound too promising  .  does he have a defence lawyer  ?  
 not yet  .  if we ca n't find a lawyer for him  then the state will appoint him with one  .  
 my sister is a lawyer  .  i can ask her if she can help him  .  
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most  ?  
 i think housing is a big problem  .  there are thousands of homeless people on the streets  .  
 how would you solve the problem  ?  
 i have a good idea to solve it  .  the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes  .  
 it would probably be very expensive  .  
 i think the government can afford it  .  besides  there are many advantages  .  homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address  .  they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i 
 it  s not a bad idea  .  i think education is the biggest problem at the moment  .  schools don  t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly  .  
 if we are to invest more money to education  we will need to raise taxes  .  that wouldn  t be popular with voters  .  
 most voters what everything both ways  .  they want the government to pay for lots of things  but without increasing taxes  .  
 the government should show that it is using money efficiently  .  sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project  .  
how was your business trip  ?  
did you understand question number three  ?  
i never understand why these shops have so much liquor  .  
 what do you mean  ?  it 's because it 's much cheaper to buy liquor dutyfree  .  
 but why  ?  why do n't people like to buy shirts dutyfree  ?  or shoes  ?  i just do n't understand why it 's always liquor  .  
 well  it 's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it  .  
 you mean liquor has a higher tax than other things  ?  
 yes  of course  .  did n't you know that  ?  
 no  i did n't  .  how high is the tax  ?  
 well  it is different in different countries . but it 's because of the high tax that buying liquor dutyfree is such a good deal  .  
 why would the government want to tax liquor so much  ?  
 liquor is considered a luxury item . and also  it is considered as something that is n't very healthy . so if people want to buy it  the government thinks it has the right to tax it  .  
 that 's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too  is n't it  ?  
will you be at the family reunion next year  ?  
hectic  .  it 's always hectic  .  but how was your windsurfing  ?  
 i tried it for a halfhour . it was interesting  but  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  i could n't really do it  .  
 see  ?  i told you  .  it 's very hard  .  
 i could n't even stand on it and hold the sail  .  i probably fell down fifty times  .  
 fifty times  ?  
 yes  it was really stupid  .  
 and how much did it cost to rent it  ?  
 it was fifty dollars for a halfhour  .  
 well  that 's not too bad then  .  
 what do you mean  ?  it 's expensive  !  
this place serves good breakfasts  do n't you think  ?  
 yes  .  but i 'm not used to eating americanstyle breakfast  .  
 what are you planning to do today  ?  
 i saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach  .  i want to rent one  .  
 have you done windsurfing before  ?  
 no  but it looks fun  .  i always wanted to try it  .  
 can you take a little advice from a friend  ?  
 sure  .  what  ?  
 do n't waste your money  .  windsurfing is very hard  .  and it will be windy today . they will charge you fifty dollars for a halfhour  and you wo n't be able to windsurf . you will fall and fall and fall  .  
 but i always wanted to try it  .  
 yes  but it takes a long time to learn . you would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer  .  
you are too picky  .  
 no  i 'm not . hey  look at that guy over there  .  
 which guy  ?  
 the guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window  .  
 i ca n't see him  .  where  ?  
 right there  .  
 oh  i see him now  .  wait  !  that 's  .  .  .  
 yes  it 's mel gibson  .  
 oh  wow  !  it 's really him  !  who is that woman he 's with  ?  
 i do n't know  .  why do n't you go ask for his autograph  ?  
 i ca n't do that  .  
i 'm not comfortable about this  sandy  .  i do n't understand most of these games  .  
 that 's okay  .  i can explain a little  .  
 i do n't want to lose all my money  .  
 do n't worry  .  you ca n't lose all your money . because you wo n't gamble all your money  .  
 i guess you 're right  .  
 of course i 'm right  .  i already told you the rule for las vegas  .  remember  ?  
 yes  i remember . you must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play  .  
 that 's right  .  that 's the best way to have control over yourself . you say to yourself  .  tonight i will gamble fifty dollars  .  only fifty dollars  .  no more . if you follow the rule  you ca n't lose more than fifty dollars  .  
 i know it 's true  sandy  .  but still some people lose control . they start to gamble  and they ca n't stop  .  
 but i wo n't let you do that  .  i will watch you  .  
 okay  .  
 so how much do you want to gamble  ?  
 maybe  dollars  .  
  dollars  !  that 's too much  !  you just said you are afraid to lose your money . if you 're afraid  why do you want to gamble  dollars  ?  
 i do n't want people to think i 'm stingy  .  
now i understand  .  but i do n't smoke or drink . so what am i supposed to buy in here  ?  
 you can buy some of these nice butterflies  .  
 no  i 'm sorry  .  i do n't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes . it is kind of disgusting  .  
 what  ?  you feel sorry for the butterflies  ?  
 yes  .  i think they should just let them fly free  and not try to sell them to foreigners  .  it is a kind of destruction of nature  .  
 well  i agree with you  .  i 'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains  .  i just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population  .  
 who knows  ?  hey  i like these jade bears here  .  
 how much are they  ?  
 this one is  dollars . maybe i should buy it for my mother  .  what do you think  ?  
 if you want  .  did n't you buy her a small vase already  ?  
 yes  but she would like this a lot  .  she likes to collect little things like this  .  
 alright  .  buy it then  .  i wo n't buy anything  .  well  maybe i 'll buy some cognac  .  
 maybe i could buy some cognac for my brother  .  he always drinks it  .  
so how much should i gamble  ?  
 why not fifty or onehundred dollars  ?  
 okay  .  onehundred then  .  do you think i will lose it  ?  
 i do n't know  .  you have to be smart  but you have to be lucky too . some games are all luck  .  with some  you need to be smart  .  
 i want games that are all luck  .  
 i knew you would say that  !  then you should play the slot machines  .  
 slot machines  ?  no  i do n't want that  !  that 's too boring  .  i want a game with cards or dice  .  
 so what do you want to play then  ?  
 blackjack . we can play blackjack  .  and i will gamble onehundred  or maybe twohundred dollars  .  
 huh  ?  you are breaking our rule already  !  and we did n't even start to play yet  !  
 oh  do n't be so strict  !  we are in las vegas  .  
hi  betty  !  
 hi  andy  how are you finding your new job  ?  
 pretty good  .  my colleagues seem alright  .  so far everything is great  .  
 that 's nice  .  what do they have you doing over there  ?  
 well  i work in the marketing department  .  the corporate culture is totally different from my last employer  .  before  when i was assigned a task  i was totally on my own but here most of the work is don 
 that s really good  .  it 's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work  .  
 indeed  .  team work is highly valued in this new company  .  i like our boss too  .  he is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation  .  he 's highly respected by all his employees  .  
 that 's great  that 's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees  .  i wish my boss was like that  .  
 true  take my former supervisor as an example  .  he was extremely controlling and overbearing  .  he always had to micromanage everything  .  
 well  now you do n't have to worry about that  .  this new place sounds really good  .  
hi  natasha  how 's life  ?  
 great  .  my family came to visit me  .  
 oh  you must be very happy  .  how many people are there in your family  ?  
 my immediate family is very large  .  it 's my mother  my father  my two older brothers  my younger sister and me  .  
 i have a small family  .  they are my parents  my younger brother and me  .  
 i thought you were the only child in the family  .  did n't china practice the onlychild policy in the early s  ?  
 yes  it did  .  but my parents are ethnic minority people  .  it 's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children  .  
 interesting  .  what do you think about families with only one child  ?  
 the child must feel very longly  .  my younger brother is  years younger than me  .  before he was born  i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one da 
 do you get along well with each other  ?  
 yes  we are very close  .  he is  years old and very smart  .  he always makes us laugh a lot  .  
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family  .  
this party rocks  !  
 you said it  .  good beer  good music  and on top of that  there are so many hot girls here  !  
 i 'm with you on that  .  check out that one over there  .  i think i 'm in love  !  
 well  she 's alright  but not really my cup of tea  .  what about the blond with the red dress  ?  
 oh  that 's janice  .  she 's just new in town  .  you have a thing for blonds  eh  ?  
 yeah  !  she could do anything she wants to me  !  
 i bet  .  why not go over and talk to her  ?  she 's really nice  .  
 i do n't think so  .  i get so nervous talking to girls  .  i always put my foot in my mouth  scare her off  and end up looking like a real fool  .  besides  she is way out of my league  .  
 come on  !  man up  !  you 'll never know until you try  .  
 okay okay  just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game  .  
 all right  .  but i think you ought to move soon  .  
 why  ?  
 i can see five other guys eying her up  .  
 okay  here i go  !  
do you have internet in your room  ?  
 sure  i am a total internet junkie  i ca n't survive without internet  .  
 really  ?  what do you usually do online  ?  
 well  there are a lot of things  like reading news  email  shopping  etc  .  but mostly i chat online  .  you could say i 'm addicted to online chatting  .  
 i never chatted online before  .  what 's it like  .  
 well  basically it 's similar to facetoface chat  but you type instead of talk  .  you should try it at least once  .  
 really  ?  who do you chat with  ?  
 to people all over the world  !  i have a lot of net pals  .  see  the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world  .  you can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were 
 that 's amazing  .  i will install an online messenger program when i get home  .  
 well  my suggestion for a newbie like you is that do n't get lost in the cyberspace  .  you know internet wo n't do the filtration for you  so you still need to use your judgement  .  there are a lot of per 
org  !  it must be so late where you are  .  what time is it  ?  
 just after  am  .  
 what 's wrong  ?  ca n't sleep  ?  
 nope  actually i was waiting for you  .  i have something big to tell you  .  
 really  ?  what is it  ?  
 i have an offer to work for a company in your city today  ?  
 i ca n't believe it  !  is it real  ?  you 're moving here  ?  
 i have n't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday i think it 's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding  .  if you have time i think we c 
 just give me the dates and i 'll make sure i 'm free  .  you know after all these chatting online  it will be great to meet you in real life  .  i look forward to seeing you soon  !  
 me too  .  but i think i am going to bed now  .  my head is getting heavy  .  have a nice day there  !  
 thanks  .  this is so exciting  .  sleep tight and sweet dreams  !  
hi  mary  !  what do you like to do in your spare time  ?  
 well  i spend a lot of time watching movies  .  
 what a confidence  !  i always watch a lot of movies  too  .  
 oh really  frank  ?  what kind of movies do you like  ?  
 actually  i watch whichever movie there is  be it a comedy  a scifi or a suspense movie  .  how about you  ?  
 art films are my favorite  but thrillers are cool  too  .  
 really impressive  .  these two genres are totally different  .  
 sure  .  i enjoy both of them very much  .  
 how often do you go to the cinema  ?  
 once in a while  i suppose  i usually rent movies at movie salon  .  
 movie salon  ?  where is that  ?  
 it 's a movie rental store in my neighborhood  .  i 've got a membership there  .  
 is it good  ?  
 yes  you can find almost all new releases there  .  
 really  ?  maybe i shall also sign up for its membership  .  
hello  jason  there is going to be a screening of final destination  at our campus cinema tomorrow  .  i plan to go to see it  .  
 is it a horror movie  ?  
 yeah  i love horror movies  .  would you like to go with me tomorrow  ?  
 no way  .  i will be scared out of my wits  .  
 that 's funny  i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside  .  
 hey  how could you like to taste my fist  ?  
 alright  all joking aside  what kinds of moves do you like  ?  
 um  let me see  romance  comedy  .  documentary  action  science fiction  animated and so on  .  
 that is to say  you like all genres except for horror movies  .  
 yeah  .  it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned  .  
 not quite  .  i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy  .  
 the notebook is this type of movie  .  
 really  ?  i have n't heard of it  .  
 well then  this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together  .  i bet you 'd love it  .  
bob  !  your eyes look bloodshot  .  did you not sleep well  ?  
 i had a drop too much last night  .  i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine  .  and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table  .  
 you have it right  .  alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china  .  drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship  especially in northern china  .  
 i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me  .  but if i keep gulping down one cup after another  i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick  .  
 you lose face by refusing to drink  and the host might think you refuse to give him face  .  the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up  .  this will endear you 
 a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night  crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood  .  
 then he must be opening his heart to the friends  .  in a word  as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort  no one will jeer at you  .  
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon  .  
 really  ?  where did you hear that  ?  
 i met with the supervisor just this morning  .  i do n't know  but i am a little worried  .  who do you think will get sacked  ?  
 i 'm not sure  .  .  .  well  first  it could n't be george  .  he is such a kissass  .  he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked  .  
 no  it 's not going to be george  .  i do n't think it 's andy either  .  he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw  .  and you know how whipped our boss is  .  
 that 's true  .  what about lisa  ?  i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her  .  
 lisa  ?  no way  .  i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair  .  you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere  .  
 well  okay  .  then there is still michael  .  but he 's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row  .  it definitely wo n't be michael  .  
 no  that would be crazy  .  but then who will it be  ?  oh dear  it must be me  .  i should have known it  !  why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing  .  what should i do  ?  i 've got a family t 
the band is pretty good  .  how do you like the music  ?  
 it 's very nice  .  i have n't heard live music in a while  .  this is fun  .  
 well  then  may i invite you for the next dance  ?  
 of course  .  but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer  .  .  .  
 do n't worry  .  i 'm not much of a dancer myself  .  
 you 're dancing so well  .  
 you dance beautifully too  .  
 when did you learn to dance  ?  
 in college  .  but i do n't dance very often  .  what 's your favourite dance  ?  
 it 's hard to say  .  it depends  .  but i love the waltz  .  
 how about tango  ?  
 oh  i like it  .  it 's such a beautiful dance  but i ca n't do it well  .  what about you  ?  
 tango is my favorite  .  anything but hiphop or the foxtrot  .  
 thank you for the dance  .  
 my pleasure  .  let 's go and have a drink  .  
it 's a beautiful day  is n't it  ?  
 yes  is n't it  .  
 do you now the temperature today  ?  
 it 's beautiful  degrees  .  
 how nice  .  i hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week  .  i 'm going on the canoe trip this weekend  .  
 not a good plan  .  the tv weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend  and the temperature will also drop to  degrees  .  
 what a nuisance  !  every time i plan to go canoeing or camping  a storm comes along  .  the sky gets dark  the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops . well  i 'd better stay home  .  
 i never make any definite weekend plan until friday morning  .  then after listening to the weather temperature  i make my plans  .  
where are you going for your holidays  charles  ?  
 to australia  .  i 'm going to visit my uncle in brisbane for three weeks  .  
 good gracious  !  you certainly are lucky  .  how are you going there  ?  
 by air  of course  .  it takes over two weeks to go by sea  .  
 i once went to singapore by air  .  it was very excitingbut never again  .  
 why  ?  did you feel frightened  ?  
 for a short time  .  one of the engines caught fire  .  
 what did the pilot do  ?  
 he put it out and flew back to the airport  .  then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was  .  
 did you land safely  ?  
we 've got a new manager in our department  .  
 oh  ?  you hoped to get that job  did n't you  ?  
 yes  i did  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  that 's too bad  .  who is it  ?  who got the job  i mean  ?  
 someone called drexler  .  carl drexler  .  he 's been with the company onlytwo years  .  i 've been here longer  .  and i know more about the job  too 
 hmm  .  why do you think they gave it to him and not to you  ?  
 because i 'm the wrong sex  of course  !  
 you mean you did n't get the job because you 're a woman  ?  
 yes  that was probably it  !  it is n't fair  .  
 what sort of clothes does he wear  ?  
 a dark suit  .  white shirt  .  a tie  .  why  ?  
 perhaps that had something to do with it  .  
 you mean you think i did n't get the job because i come to work in jeansand a sweater  ?  
 it 's possible  is n't it  ?  
 do you really think i should wear different clothes  ?  
 well  .   .   .  perhaps you should think about it  .  
 why should i wear a skirt  ?  or a dress  ?  
 i 'm not saying you should  .  i 'm saying you should think about it  .  that 's all  !  
 why should i do that  ?  i 'm good at my job  !  that 's the only important thing  !  
i had broken up with him  how painful i feel  .  i  m going to drown my sorrows  .  
do you believe in ufo 's  ?  
 sure  .  a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet  .  if you think about it  our space shuttles are ufos  .  
 i 've never thought about it like that before  .  
 i 've seen photos of ufos in america before  but they 've all looked doctored up  .  
 do you think that there 's life on other planets  ?  
 i think there must be  .  
 why is that  ?  
 i do n't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world  .  the world is just far too big for that  .  
 do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us  ?  
 no  but we 're trying to contact them  .  
 i suppose you 're right  .  
 i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet  humankind will not become extinct  .  
 do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day  ?  
you have drank dozens of cups  .  you are bound to get a bay window  .  
i  m betting the new york yankees win  .  how about you  ?  
 well  i  m favor of the red sox  .  they  ve had a good season  .  
 sorry  guys  .  could i just interrupt for a moment  ?  my money is on the yankees  !  
 that  s not a very good pick  .  i  m against the yankees  .  
 hey  ken  .  good luck if you already put your money on the red sox  .  
what did you do over the weekend  ?  
 i went a global warming rally in london  .  it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment  .  
 do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already  ?  
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves  but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening  .  
 like what  ?  
 well  we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start  .  
 what else can we do to protect the environment  ?  
 if you do have to drive  you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol  .  also  your home should use sources of renewable energy  .  
 how about recycling  ?  does that actually help  ?  
 yes  .  you should take your glass  paper  plastic  cardboard  and tin cans to a recycling center  .  
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future  ?  
 i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone  .  
 i had no idea you were such as environmentalist before  !  
excuse me  what do you want for this bag  ?  
 let me see  .  the one goes for    .  
 would you take    ?  
 no  i can  t let you have it for  . how about   ?  
  .   ?  
i have never experienced a roller coaster  .  i want you to sit beside me  .  
 wait a moment  i want to go to the toilet  .  
wow  !  what  s the hold up  ?  
 it  s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend  .  nobody sticks around in the summer  .  
 really  ?  then  i guess i won  t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab  ?  
 actually  you might because there  s a big convention in town this weekend  .  
what time is our connecting flight  ?  
 let me check . oh  oh  !  it  s at   .  
 wow  that 's cutting it close  !  that means we only have  minutes to make the connection  !  what gate is it at  ?  
 it  s at  .  .  .  gate   .  
 oh  great  !  that  s at the other end of the terminal  !  
 ok  so here  s the plan  when we land  run to gate   !  
what do you do  ?  
 i  m a firefighter  .  
 really  ?  that  s so cool  .  
 i  m really lucky to do something i really love  .  
 what station do you work at  ?  
excuse me  do you have any english songs  ?  
 yes  we do  .  they are all in this book  .  
 great  thanks  .  
 no problem  .  just give us a few minutes more to pull them up  though  .  we don  t get that many english singers  !  
what was the biggest turing point in your life  ?  
 i usee i would say that would be moving out of my parents  house for the first time  .  
 really  ?  why is that  ?  
 till i moved out of my parents  home  i became a lot more independent  .  
 what would you say was the lowest point in your life  ?  
 that would definitely be getting a divorce  .  
 what went wrong  ?  
 we just were n't right for each other  .  
 how long were you married  ?  
 the marriage only lasted about a year  .  
 have you remarried since then  ?  
 yes  i got married to a man that i met shortly after i divorced my first husband  .  
 do you think you 'll ever get a divorce again  ?  
 oh i hope not  my first marriage was a mistake  but this one isn  t  .  
 how long have you been married  ?  
 about  years now  .  
 do you think you 'll still love him when he is old and gray  ?  
 i think so  hopefully we  ll have a long and a happy life together  .  
how many people are there in your family  ?  
 my immediate family is quite small  .  it 's just my older stepbrother  my mom  my stepdad and me  .  how about you  ?  
 i have a large family  .  i have three older sisters  my twin sister  a younger brother  and my parents  .  
 i did n't know you were a twin  !  are you identical or fraternal  ?  
 we 're identical  .  i mean  we look exactly the same  but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else  !  
 interesting  .  it must be great having a twin sister  .  are you best friends  too  ?  
 we used to be really close  but that all changed once she moved to shanghai  .  how about your family  ?  you did n't mention to your biological father  .  
 i do n't know much about him  .  he died when i was just a baby  .  even though i do n't have a blood relationship with my stepfather and stepbrother  i consider them to be my real family  .  
 what about your stepbrother 's mother  ?  does he keep in touch with her  ?  
 no  she also died when my stepbrother was little  .  my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends  .  they ended up getting married a few years later  .  
did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning  ?  
 no  .  i have n't had a chance to read the paper yet  .  
 you 've got to see it  .  it 's an unbelievable picture  !  
 what 's so interesting about it  ?  
 well  this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up  half his face had been bitten off  !  
 what  ?  how did that happen  ?  
 they think his dog was trying to wake him up and could n't  so ended up biting him in his face  .  
 wow  .  what does his look like now  ?  
 it looks pretty frightening  .  he does n't have any lips  so all you can see are his gums and teeth  .  most of his nose and chin are missing too  .  
 what did he look like before his dog bit his face off  ?  
 he was actually quite handsome  .  what a shame  .  
 what 's he going to do now  ?  
you know iden  i don  t know much about you  .  where were you born  ?  
 i was born in london  but i spent most of my childhood in hongkong  .  
 what was your childhood like  ?  
 i had a pretty strict upbring  and my parents and i were always fighting about it  .  
 do you get along with your parents now  ?  
 oh  sure  .  once they reached middle age  they became a lot less uptight  .  
 where did you go to university  ?  
 my parents wanted me to stay in hongkong  but i decided to go back to england  i graduated from oxford university with a degree in english literature  .  
 what  s your current occupation  ?  
 i  m a freelance writer  .  i write magazine articles and fiction books 
 did you always know you wanted to be a writer  ?  
 no  i didn  t  .  i was an english teacher for about five years  but by the time i was thirty  i decided i want a fresh challenge  .  
 how did you start writing  ?  
 i started writing margin articles for fun  and eventually was asked to write a book  so i was pretty lucky  .  
 are you writing a book now  ?  
 yes  it  s about a group of friends living in a foreign country  and all the strange experiences they have 
have you ever thought about having children  kaitlyn  ?  
 my husband and i have thought about it  but we 've decided not to have any  .  they 're just too expensive  .  besides  with all the news about global warming on the news lately  who knows what kind of worl 
 well  i 've always wanted to have lots of children  .  growing up with only one brother  i always felt a bit lonely  .  what do you think about families with only one child  ?  
 for me  growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention  .  i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i would n't ever have to share  .  
 do n't you think you would miss having other people around  ?  
 no way  !  i spent  years of my life with relatives around me   .  you know  i do n't think i 've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents home  .  what do you think fo the onechild policy 
 if china did n't have such a policy  can you imagine how many people there would be in china now  ?  
 that 's true  .  but as a woman  i 'm glad that even though i do n't want any children  i at least have a choice in how many children i have  .  on the other hand  i ca n't imagine what china would be like 
 do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child  ?  
i do n't know about you  but i 'm famished  .  are you interested in getting a bite to eat  ?  
 that sounds great  .  i 'm absolutely starving  !  what kind of food are you in the mood for  ?  
 i 'd love something spicy  .  maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot  .  
 you 're a woman after my own heart  .  i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food  .  are you sure you are up for hotpot  .  
 sure  .  if i could  i would eat hotpot every day  !  
 ok  you 're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food  are n't you  ?  
 well  let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hotpot restaurant for dinner  !  
 let me think about it for a minute  .  let 's see  .  .  .  oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue  !  give me a second and it 'll come to me  .  
 well  .  .  .   ?  have you thought of it yet  ?  
 no  .  .  .  
 never mind  .  there 's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street  .  have you been there  ?  
 that 's it  !  that 's the one i was thinking of  !  i told you i 'd remember it  !  
what 's the life expectancy in your country  ?  
 i 'm not sure  but probably about  years  .  how about in your country  ?  
 about   i think  .  this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population  .  it 's a problem that will soon affect most of the world  .  
 i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age  because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly  .  
 perhaps we need to have more babies  !  tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday  .  
 did she  ?  that 's great  .  however  if we have too many children  that will have a bad effect on the environment  .  
 how 's your son these days  ?  
 oh  he 's fine  .  kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays  .  
 he 'll be a teenager before you know it  !  teenagers are often rebellious  !  when do you think it is a good age to have a child  ?  
 i had mine when i was   .  that 's a little young  .  i 'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties  or even in your early thirties if you have a good career  .  
 yes  i think you 're right  .  i 'm thinking about having a child  but not just yet  .  
 is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country  ?  
 yes  there is  .  teenagers do not want to live traditional lives  .  they want to go out  have fun  and explore the world  .  they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discour 
 parents usually give their children more freedom in my country  .  sometimes they give them too much freedom  .  
i had a big argument with david yesterday  .  i hope he  s not still mad at me  .  
 what did you argue about  ?  
 he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back  .  he said he didn  t have the money yet  .  
 well  he should pay you back  .  it  s only fair  .  
 yes  but is got angry with him too quickly  .  he probably thought that i mistrusted him  .  i shouldn  t have got angry  .  
 did you lend him a lot of money  ?  
 not much  .  i had to pay an unexpected bill  so i needed the money back  .  
 well  talk to him about it next time you see him  .  he probably feels as bad about it as you do  .  close friends sometimes have disagreements  .  it  s nothing unusual  .  neither of you said anything r 
 no  we didn  t  .  i guess you  re right  .  we should patch things up  .  
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends  ?  
 i like people who are open and friendly  .  those people are usually more active and fun to be with  .  i like spending time with my friends  .  we go to bars together or play sports together  .  
 i don  t like to make friends with people who aren  t honest  .  honesty is very important to me  .  
 i think it  s important to most people  .  the problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them  .  
 you can find out from their friends  .  
 if you know any of their friends  .  you can  t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time  .  you have to go out and make the first move sometimes  .  i also like funny people  .  
 oh  i don  t  .  they don  t seem to take anything seriously  .  you never know when they are joking and when they are being serious  .  
 sometimes it can be hard to tell  but if you know the person fairly well  you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking  .  
 it seems that we generally like different kinds of people  .  how is it that we are such good friends  ?  
when you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill  what do you do to attract his attention  ?  
 i just make eye contact with him and nod my head  .  then i tell him when he comes over to the table  .  why do you ask  ?  
 i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill  .  
 that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant  .  
 that  s what i thought  .  i just thought i  d ask you and see what you thought of it  .  anyway  what did you do yesterday evening  ?  
 well  it was a warm evening  so i stretched my legs  .  i walked along the canal for a couple of miles  .  actually  several other people had the same idea  .  i saw bill  .  
 did you  ?  how is he these days  ?  
 he seemed ok  .  we didn  t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal  .  we just waved at each other  .  
 i need to move some furniture  .  could you help me to lift it  ?  
 of course  .  what do you want to move first  ?  
do you like barry  ?  
 no  not very much  .  he 's too ambitious and dishonest  .  
 i agree  .  i like his brother paul  .  they are not alike  .  
 yes  .  they are completely different  .  paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother  .  
 what kind of person do you consider yourself to be  ?  
 i think i 'm polite  careful  relaxed and shy  .  
 oh  i do n't think you 're shy  !  you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party  .  
 well  .  yes  but those people always start talking to me  .  i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think  .  anyway  you 're certainly not shy  !  
 you 're right  .  i love going out and making new friends  .  
 so  you 'll be at my birthday party on friday  ?  
are you going to helen  s birthday party on friday evening  ?  
 i wouldn  t miss it for the world  !  it  s sure to be fun  .  she  s invited a lot of people  .  do you think everyone will be able to get into her house  ?  
 if everyone turned up  it would be a squeeze  .  but a few people said that they couldn  t go  .  so i think it should be ok  ?  
 are you taking anything  ?  
 i  ve got her a birthday present and i  ll take a bottle fo wine too  .  
 that  s a good idea  .  she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks  .  i think it  s going to be a noisy party  .  i hope her neighbors don  t mind too much  .  
 helen gets on very well with her neighbors  .  i wouldn  t be surprised if they went to the party too  .  
 i  m really looking forward to it  .  this party is going to be a blast  !  
that was a great party  .  thanks for saying behind to help me clear up  .  
 it certainly was a great party  .  it  s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here  .  
 i expected that something might get broken  .  that doesn  t bother me  .  that spilled drink won  t leave a stain  will it  ?  
 i doubt it  i  ll deal with it right away  .  luckily it wasn  t a glass of red wine  i  ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth  .  
 i  m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag  .  
 afterwards  we can do the washing up together  .  everything will be finished within an hour  .  your friend keith is really funny  .  i liked his magic tricks  .  
 yes  he  s very good  .  .  isn  t he  ?  he told some funny stories too  .  
 amanda told some very funny jokes  .  at the beginning of the party  she was being ver serious  .  
 i think that she had a litter too much of the punch  .  
 what did you put in that punch  ?  it tasted great  but was quite strong  .  
 that  s my little secret  .  did you like the snacks and i prepared  ?  
 very much  .  the birthday cake was delicious  wasn  t it  ?  emily told me that she and karen made it themselves  .  
 that cake tasted so good  !  it disappeared within minutes  so i think everyone liked it a lot  .  how  s that stain  ?  
so  tell me about your new house  .  how is it different to your old one  ?  
 well  first of all  it  s much bigger  .  it has the same number of rooms  but each room is larger  .  we also have a larger garden  which our dog loves  of course  !  
 so  it  s a threebedrooms detached house  ?  
 yes  .  one bedroom is for my wife and i  .  there  s another for our daughter  .  my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room  but i  d like to make it into a study  .  our daughter is also keen on 
 what  s the kitchen like  ?  i know both you and your wife like to cook  .  
 that  s one of the main reason we chose that particular house  .  the kitchen and dining room are together  .  it  s really large  .  
 are the rooms nice and bright  ?  
 yes  they are  .  that  s very important to us  .  we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light  .  each room has large windows  .  
 do you have a balcony  ?  
 no  we don  t  .  we wish we had one  .  that  s the only thing we wanted  but don  t have  .  the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly  .  
 you  re right on the edge of the city  aren  t you  ?  there can  t be much noise or traffic there  .  is it easy to get into city centre  ?  
so  your friend  s getting married on saturday  .  what have you bought her as a wedding gift  .  i find is so hard to choose the right gift  .  
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea  .  they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook  .  the picture are of things they want  .  people sign their name b 
 that  s clever  !  then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there  s no chance of two people buying the same gift  .  what things were in the notebook  ?  
 most of the things were household appliance  .  you know  everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker  .  i think it  s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help 
 so  what did you get them  ?  
 i bought a sewing machine  .  i know that my friend likes making her own clothes  but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems  .  
 what  s wrong with is  ?  
 she says that after several years of use  it  s not working properly  .  when she uses it  it makes a funny noise  .  
 household appliance don  t seem to last for a long time nowadays  .  
do you do a lot of your shopping online  ?  
 not really  .  i like looking on the internet at what  s available  but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i  m buying before i pay for it  .  sometimes  i  ll look at something in a shop  but lat 
 no  .  i  m a little worried about security  .  you never know who  s trying to find out your codes and passwords  .  aren  t you worry about that  ?  
 not really  .  i know that it happens  but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites  you should be ok  .  even though i use online shopping facilities  i don  t think it  s the best way to sho 
 i  m surprised to hear you say that  .  i thought you loved anything technological  .  
 i do  .  i  m a big fan of using new technology  but i don  t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day  .  i think people need to get out and interact with other people  .  
 so  how about coming to the department store with me  ?  i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet  .  
 sure  .  i  d love to join you  .  can we stop by the computer store  ?  i just want to see if they have something  .  
 sure  .  while you  re in the computer store  .  i will visit the book store opposite  .  i like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting  .  
 ok  .  i  ve finished online  .  let  s go  .  i  ll just get some money and my credit card  .  
so you 're going picnicking  ?  
 yeah  .  i 'm going with jennie  .  
 have a good day  !  
hello  bill  !  how are things going  ?

 i 'd like a pair of shoes  please  .  
how are you doing  jim  ?  
 fine  just fine . how about you  ?  
excuse me  are you jane  ?  
 no  i 'm mary  .  
 oh  are you in class four  ?  
how do you do  ?  
 how do you do  ?  
 my name is jane greenwood . glad to meet you  .  
mary sings much better than susan  does n't she  ?  
 yes . but mary is no match for susan in painting  .  
plastic bags are widely used nowadays  .  
 but they 're hard to be disposed of  .  
tell me  what do you enjoy doing in your spare time  ?  
 i enjoy drawing and painting  .  
 you know how to draw and paint  ?  
 yes  i do  .  
 when did you learn how to do that  ?  
 i learned back in high school  .  
 oh  so you took an art class  ?  
 yeah  i loved that art class  .  
 i see that you 're pretty talented  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 i wish i had a talent like that  .  
i really want to go to the beach this weekend  .  
 that sounds like fun  .  what 's the weather going to be like  ?  
 i heard that it 's going to be warm this weekend  .  
 is it going to be perfect beach weather  ?  
 i believe so  .  
 good  .  i hope it does n't cool off this weekend  .  
 i know  .  i really want to go to the beach  .  
 but you know that california weather is really unpredictable  .  
 you 're right  .  one minute it 's hot  and then the next minute it 's cold  .  
 i really wish the weather would just stay the same  .  
 i do too  .  that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time  .  
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend  .  
 a trip to the beach would be fun  .  how is the weather going to be  ?  
 the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend  .  
 so do you think it 'll be perfect weather for the beach  ?  
 it sounds like it will be  .  
 i really hope it does n't get cold  .  
 that would ruin things  i want to go so badly  .  
 the weather in california is unpredictable  so you never know  .  
 that is true  .  the weather is constantly changing  .  
 it would be nice if the weather would never change  .  
 that would be great  then we could plan things sooner  .  
how 's it going  ?  
 i 'm doing well  .  how about you  ?  
 never better  thanks  .

 thank you so much  .  i would really appreciate that  .  
is this the friendship hospital  ?  please send an ambulance to  hu nan road  .

 of course  .  it 's urgent  .  i think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis  .  he may die if not treated in time  .  
 all right  we 'll come right away  .  
  after a while  .  .  .   where 's the patient  ?  
 he 's there in the room  .  he 's very ill  .

welcome to perfect getaway tours  .  how can i help you  ?  
 i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife  .  
 very well  we have a couple of different options such as beaches  the wilderness  the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend  .  
 i think something in the countryside would be nice  .  
 perfect  !  this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire  .  a free airport pickup is included  .  our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirtyminute ride to the countryside  .  
 sounds good  !  what is the hotel that we will be staying at like  ?  
 that is the best part  .  your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests  .  you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm n included in the price is three meals a day  excluding beverages  .  you can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush  green gardens  .  if you prefer  your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace  .  
 wow  !  this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy  !  are there any outdoor activities we can take part in  ?  
 of course  !  the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail  .  you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard  .  
i have to check out now  .  my name is ruth carson  .  can i have my bill  please  ?  
 yes  it 's    .  
could i see the manager please  ?  i have a complaint to make  .  
 yes  i  m the manager here  .  what can i do for you  madam  ?  
 did you have the room checked before we move in  ?  
 which room are you in  ?  
   .  the toilet doesn  t work properly  .  the water doesn  t run in the shower  .  
 i  m awfully sorry to hear that  .   after checking  i  ll turn to it right away  .  i do apologize  .  we  ll change your room to   .  
 that  s not bad  .  thanks for your help  .  
did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel  ?  i heard it  s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities  .  
 i had a wonderful time  .  the rooms are not very big  but they are well furnished  .  the restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced  .  there  s a sauna and a jacuzzi  .  
 do they have a swimming pool  ?  
 no  they don  t  .  they have a beauty parlor  but i didn  t go there  .  
 what  s the service like  ?  
 it  s very good  .  check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes  .  the wait staff is very good  .  a waiter recommended their baked fish  which tasted wonderful  .  the hotel was quite full  so i  d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there  .  the hotel offers a discount at the weekends  .  
 it sounds perfect  .  did you have any complaints at all  ?  
 there was a problem with the internet access  so i couldn  t check my email  but i didn  t complain about it to the management  .  
 i suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world  .  
 yes  i was  .  here  s their business card  .  
 thanks  .  was there a mina bar in the room  ?  
 no  there wasn  t  .  there is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal  .  
 one of the things i dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips  .  
this is the route i thought we could take on our hike on saturday afternoon  .  
 how long is it altogether  ?  
 it  s about six or seven miles  .  that  s about ten kilometers  .  
 that sounds ok  .  so  we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall  .  
 right  .  then we turn left and walk up this small hill  .  the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb  .  we can eat a snack there  .  
 then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church  .  
 we can spend a few minutes looking around the church  .  then  we turn right and walk along this path  .  
 this path leads to the cave  .  can we look inside the cave  ?  
 yes  we can  but it isn  t very interesting  .  
 then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path  .  
 that  s right  .  
 how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk  ?  
 i think it will take about four hours  including breaks  .  
 that  s fine  .  are there signposts along the way  in case we get lost  ?  
have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet  ?  
 yes  i have  .  i handed in my application form two weeks ago and i  m going for an interview next week  .  
 good luck  !  i  ve heard it  s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states  .  
 the application form are quite complicated  .  it took me a few hours to fill it out  .  the hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents  .  that took almost two weeks  .  
 what kind of documents did you need to present  ?  
 i had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education  because i want a student visa  .  
 why do you think so many people have their applications rejected  ?  
 i think that they don  t complete the forms correctly or they don  t include all the required documents  .  the embassy is very strict about it  .  you have to be quite careful  .  
 why are they stricter with chinese people than with other nationalities  ?  
good morning  !  the inland hotel  .  how may i help you  ?  
 good morning  .  i  d like to book a room for friday night and saturday night  .  
 certainly  .  what kind of room would you like  ?  
 a single room please  .  i hope you  re not fully booked  .  
 a single room  ?  that  s fine  .  in whose name shall i make the booking  ?  
 jones  .  according to your website  the nightly rate is    including breakfast  .  
 we offer a   discount for guests staying of friday and saturday  .  the total cost will be    including breakfast  .  
 thank you very much  .  i look forward to seeing you on friday  .  
 could i just take your credit card number please  ?  i should mention that there is a cancellation charge of    .  
next please  !  hello sir  may i see your passport please  ?  
 yes  here you go  .  
 will you be checking any bags today  .  
 yes  i  d like to check three pieces  .  
 i  m sorry  sir  .  airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage  at twenty kilograms each  plus one piece of carryon luggage  .  i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase  .  
 what  ?  why  !  i am taking an intercontinental flight  !  i  m flying sixteen thousand cms  !  how am i supposed to only take two  twenty kilo bags  ?  that  absurd  !  
 i am sorry  sir  there  s nothing i can do  .  you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry  on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat  .  that bag is clearly too big  .  
 now i see  .  you charge next to nothing for an international ticket  but when it comes to charging for any other small thing  you charge an arm and a leg  !  so tell me  miss  how much will i have to pay for all of this  .  
 let  s see  .  .  .  six hundred and twentyfive us dollars  .  
do you think we can get to the airport by  
 we should make it  if there is n't too much traffic  .  
 is it the rush hour now  ?  
you must be pretty excited about your trip to europe  .  when is it that you are leaving  ?  
 in just three weeks  and i am excited  .  but there are still a few things i need to do before i go  .  
 like what  ?  
 like renewing my passport  going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while i  m gone  .  
 you are not going to give it up  are you  ?  
 no way  .  i  ll never find another apartment around here  .  but i don  t like the idea of paying three months  rent on an empty apartment  either  .  
 i don  t blame you  .  perhaps you could sublet it  .  
 yes  but whom to  ?  
 mmm  .  .  .  let me think  .  oh  i know just a person  .  an old colleague of mine  jim thomas  is coming here to do some research this summer  from june to august  .  
 that  s exactly when i  ll be away  .  it sounds ideal  as long as the landlord agrees  .  
 tell you what  i  ll be calling jim late this week anyway  so i  ll mention it to him then  .  
i need to know why i 'm being charged   for a movie that i never ordered  .  
 hmm  .  your file shows that you watched titanic monday night  .  
 monday night  ?  monday night i was at a great concert  .  
 well  as they say  garbage in  garbage out  .  let me correct this error  please  .  
 thank you  .  it 's very nice when problems can be solved quickly  .  
 when i deleted the    the computer automatically added a   service charge  .  
 are you crazy  ?  you made the mistake and now you 're charging me for your mistake  ?  
 sir  if it makes you feel any better  the   service fee used to be    .  
 why do n't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything i have  ?  
can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to  ?  
 of course  !  how much would you like to spend on your meal  ?  
 my date is quite sophisticated  .  she would expect nothing less than the best  .  
 well  how about our own hotel restaurant  ?  it 's conveniently located and has a threestar rating  .  
 that 's a good idea  except i want to go out  not stay in  .  something else  maybe  ?  
 well  how about gramercy tavern  ?  it 's a very popular tourist spot  with great food and music  .  
 that sounds good  !  could you call them to see if i can get a reservation  ?  
i need a suggestion for a restaurant here in manhattan  .  
 certainly  !  how much are you planning to spend on dinner  sir  ?  
 my date 's very sophisticated  so i 'm sure she would expect nothing but the best  .  
 may i suggest our own hotel restaurant  ?  it got three stars in the latest restaurant review  .  
 no  thank you  i want to go out on the town  .  what other ideas do you have  ?  
 there 's always gramercy tavern  .  they have live jazz  .  the food is delicious  but very expensive  .  
 that sounds like a good place to take a date  .  can you make a reservation for me  ?  
could i order dinner  ?  
 of course  .  what would you like  ?  
 i want a bottle of champagne  lobster tail  and filet mignon  medium rare  .  
 i 'm so sorry  .  we ran out of filet mignon  .  may i suggest the porterhouse instead  ?  
 that 's too bad  but the porterhouse will be okay  .  
 may i be so bold as to suggest chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne  ?

 no strawberries  .  we 'll charge your amenities account  if that 's okay  .

 we have a computer lab on the first floor  .  
 that 's great  !  how much is it  ?  
 it 's absolutely free to guests  .  except for printing  of course  .  
 okay  .  what about the other alternatives  ?  
 you could use your wireless right here in our lobby  .  
 yes  that 's the ticket  !  and if i need to print something there  ?  
could you bring me some food  please  ?  
 sure  .  what do you fancy  ?  
 can i have a bottle of champagne  lobster tail  and filet mignon  medium rare  ?  
 sir  the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out  .  may i suggest the porterhouse  ?  
 oh  no filet  ?  okay  porterhouse will be fine then  .  
 perhaps you would like chocolatecovered strawberries with the champagne  ?  
 not tonight  but thank you for the suggestion  .  
 okay  .  this will be charged to your amenities account  okay  ?  
 no problem  .

 okay  no strawberries tonight  .  the items will be charged to your amenities account  .  
 go right ahead  .

 uhoh  !  i ca n't use ethernet  .  my computer is wireless only  .  
 that 's okay  .  i can tell you about some alternatives we have  .  
 any alternative that works will be great  .

 that sounds good  .  what 's the charge  ?  
 the lab and the computers are no charge  but you have to pay for whatever you print  .  
 that sounds good  .  now  how about the other alternatives  ?  
 of course  .  our lobby is set up for wireless  so just bring your computer down here  .  
 use my laptop in the lobby  ?  that 's great  !  now  if i need to print something there  ?  
well  we did n't ask for this room service . it must be somebody else 's  i 'm sure  .  
 oh  is it  ?  let me check  .  
 yes  please  .  
 i 'm sorry to say that this room service charge is yours  .  
 we paid for the room service already in our room  .

 this room is overrun with cockroaches  .  
 there has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel  sir  .  
 i stopped counting at nine  .  
 sir  this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors  .  
 your inspector needs spectacles  .  the fact is that cockroaches are running rampant  .  
i want to change rooms immediately  plus a refund for tonight  .  
 i 'm sorry  sir  .  exactly what is the problem  ?  
 i 'm kneedeep in cockroaches  !  
 i 'm so sorry  sir  .  we 'll give you a new room immediately  and give you a refund also  .  
 thank you  .  i 'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact  .  
i have a little problem with room   .  
 problems are what we 're here for  sir  .  please tell me your problem  .  
 this room is filthy with cockroaches  .  
 were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them  sir  ?  
 i 've already seen nine of them and  as they say  eight is enough  !  
 sir  sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots  .  
 you are not in a position to question my vision or my statement  !  
i 'm quite upset  !  i want a new room and a refund for tonight  .  
 forgive me  sir  i have n't been told what the problem is  .  
 i 'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches  !  
 my apologies  sir  .  we 'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund  .  
 thank you  .  i did n't want to have to take this to court  .  
i 've been looking for a swimming pool  but i have n't found one yet  .  
 we have no pool  sir  but we do have swim stations in our gym  .  
 swim stations  ?  could you be a little more explicit  ?  
 you know how you run on a treadmill but do n't go anywhere  ?  well  it 's the same thing  .  
 gee  that 's a great idea  .  now  how much do i have to pay  ?  
 the stations are absolutely free to guests  sir  .  
 great  !  now  when can i go down there and use the stations  ?  
 the swim stations are open daily from  a  .  m  .  to  p  .  m  .  
 boy  oh boy  !  i ca n't wait to change into my swim trunks  .  
i think i 've looked everywhere  but i have n't seen a swimming pool here  .  
 this hotel has no fullsize pool  but we do have swim stations in our gym  .  
 swim stations  ?  whoever heard of such a thing  ?  
 you swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill  .  
 all that exercise in a little pool  !  do i have to pay anything  ?  
 the swim stations are available to all guests for no charge  .  
 very good  .  now can you tell me the hours of operation  ?  
 they 're available anytime between  a  .  m  .  and  p  .  m  .   seven days a week  .  
 wow  !  i ca n't wait to change into my trunks  !  
i have a reservation  .  my name is john sandals  .  
 may i see your id  please  mr  .  sandals  ?  
 certainly  .  here it is  .  
 thank you  .  do you have a credit card  mr  .  sandals  ?  
 yes  i do  .  do you accept american express  ?  
 sorry  sir  just visa or mastercard  .  
 okay  .  here 's my visa card  .  
 okay  .  you 're in room   .  it 's a single queensize bed  spacious  and nonsmoking  .  is that suitable  ?  
 yes  it sounds like everything i expected  .  
this is our best product  .  
 how long will it take to make five hundred  ?  
 they 'll be done before the end of the week  .  
have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment  ?  
 i wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection  .  
 i 'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is   irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents  .  
 but our order this time is very large  .  to open an l  c for such a large amount at a bank is costly  .  can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little  ?  
 i 'm afraid not  .  we insist on a letter of credit  because as seller  we also have the problem of funds being tied up  .  
 to be frank  a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import  .  when i open a letter of credit with a bank  i have to pay a deposit  .  that will tie up my money and add to my cost  .

 i have heard that the cream is longer lasting  .  
 is there anything i can take that will help with the itching  ?

 well  let  s have a look  .  open wide  .  hmm  .  .  .  this doesn  t look good  .  well  it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose  .  we  ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse  and the crown probably needs to be refitted  .  i  m going to order some xrays  .

 no  not at all  !  just lay back and relax  .

 good  .  i will add this to the contract  .  
 the second thing i would like to point out  that is packaging  .  it 's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes  .  but i think the wooden cases are much safer  .

 thank you  sir  .  
 we 've looked over your letter and resume and i 'm very satisfied with them  .  today i want to invite you talk about insurance you 're interested in  .

 that  s great  .  if you don  t mind my asking  does your company give bonuses  ?  
 you  ll get bonuses at the end of each year according to your achievements  .  besides  we offer you   commission on all your sales  .  
 oh  just one more thing  could you give me some idea about holidays  ?  
 you can have saturdays and sundays off  .  in addition  you may have a paid month vacation every year  .  but when it is necessary  we do expect you to work overtime  .  does it suit you  ?  
 no problem  .  
 if you are satisfied with the conditions here  please sign this contract and give it to me  .  
what is my schedule for today  miss liu  ?  
 yes  you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning  .  then  you have a lunch appointment with mr  .  clark  .  and this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants  .  
 do you have the meeting report ready  ?  
kenvir  ?  hi  it 's alice  .  i 'm very sorry that i have a big favor to ask you again  .  
 how big  alice  ?  last time you said that  i ended up working overtime  nights  .

 i think the gears have seized up

 to start with i would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time  .

 i knew everything would work out for you  !  
 i got to meet the night anger today too  .  we got along right from the start  .  
 wonderful  !  do you already have your work schedule  ?

good morning  everyone  .  let me introduce myself to you  .  .  .  
 you do n't need to introduce yourself  yang  .  you 're famous  .  
 well  thank you very much but i thought l 'd try and chair the meeting by the rule  at least for a while  .  
 ok  ok  !  
 now  i 'd like to get things under way  .  the main topic on today 's agenda is the development of a u  .  s  .  sales strategy for the new ebb  .  i 'd like to hear all of your ideas  mr  .  wall  you seem in top form today  .  could you start the ball rolling  ?  
 uh  oh  sure  .  well  i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising  .  
 well  that 's kind of obvious  .  
 give me a break  mr yang  .  
hello  !  you 're welcome to guangzhou fair  .  
 thank you  .  i 'm from america  .  here is my business card  .  
 glad to meet you  mr  .  smith  .  my name is wang and here is my name card  .  i 'll be glad to do what i can for you  .  
 great  !  this is my first visit to the fair  .  everything is new to me  .  would you please give me some information  ?  
 glad to  .  the fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year  thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with china  .  
 what about your company  ?  
 ours is a company special in exporting leather products  .  and what about yours  ?  
good morning  sir  can i help you  ?  
 yes  i was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition  ?  
 i 'd be glad to  sir  .  but may i ask what line of business you are in  ?  
 i 'm in the electrical appliances  .  
 i see  .  would you be interested in seeing the audiovisual products  ?  they are made by our company  .  
 thanks  they are rather attractive  .  but i think there is nothing better than seeing things in actual operation  .  
 yes  of course  .  would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories  ?  
 yes  very much  if it would n't add inconvenience to you  .  first hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets  .  
 i 'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow  .  
we are interested in some precision machine tools  .  we have some inquires on hand  .  
 that 's fine  .  we can supply all kinds of precision machine tools  .  our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry  .  
 can i have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data  ?  
 why  of course  .  here are some that will show you our latest development  .  you may select which ever you need  .  
 i think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high  compared with those of other supplies  .  
 excuse me  .  it 's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers  but it 's only due to our technological superiority  .  
 your products may have certain advantages  but your prices are too stiff  .  
 if you give us your inquiry  i shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms  .  
 ok  i 'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list  .  
oh  gosh  !  i feel everything around me is against me  .  
 do n't take it too hard  .  there are some tips you should know in jobhunting of   .  
 well  i am all ears  .  maybe they are helpful  .  
 firstly  you must always show your best to the interviewer  .  and secondly  try to avoid spamming through emails  because this will make the reader go crazy  .  the last but not the least  there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age  .  
 i understand what you mean  and i will not upset myself  .  face it  .  
could you tell me which kind of payment you 'll choose  ?  
 we 're going to pay by check  .  
 will you please have the check certified  ?  
 if you think it is necessary  .  
 it 's just our policy  .  we would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance  .  
now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago  .  can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy  ?  
 as you know  we are in a very special time  .  this is a very hard time for many countries economics  both developed and developing  .  i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies  .  
 what is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country 's economy  ?  
 once the us economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack  the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world  .  
 what challenges is your country 's economy facing at the moment  ?  
jim  what do you think of that first interviewee  ?  
 well  he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy  .  
 okay  what about the first woman  ?  
 she looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills  .  
 all right  and what about the older gentle  ?  
 he was very distinguished  maybe a bit overqualified  .  
 ohhhh  .  i hate this part of my job  .  
how would you like this order shipped  ?  
 send it by the fastest way  .  
 are you going to ship this by air  ?  that might cost a little more  .  
 how much  ?  
 i 'll check the costs and call you back  .  
how was your flight from hong kong  ?  
 okay  .  what time is the meeting tomorrow  ?  
we 've been discussing the project for two hours  .  let 's take a break  .  
mr . chen  do you mind if i smoke  ?  
your definition on success  ?  
 most people think that wealth means success  .  but from my point of view  the problem should be viewed from two aspects  .  on the one hand  wealth is a very important thing to measure success  .  the ability to make money  to some extent  signifies your knowledge  your capability  the value of your labor  etc  .  .  with the development of our economy and industry  more and more people are pursuing money these days  .  and in toda  s society  if you have money  you seem to have everything  .  but this is not the case  .  i think success  on the other hand  also means satisfaction from work  .  it also means that you can get respect from others  .  
 what  s your ideal job  ?  
 ideally  i  d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week  .  i  m the kind of person who can set priorities  work well independently  and set my own pace  .  i actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed  .  but i realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home  and i have  of course  performed very successfully in a traditional office setting  .  
 how would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors  ?  
 very good  .  basically  once our sales plan was put together  i had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way i felt best  .  
 how would your present boss describe you  ?  
 he always says i am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility  sufficient education  and enough experience  .  
 what would your colleagues say about you  ?  
what 's your ideal boss  ?  
and how would you describe yourself  miss tao  ?  what kind of person are you  ?  
 well  as i mentioned before  i think i am easygoing  .  i enjoy working and talking with people and i 'm a responsible person  .  
 did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers  ?  
 no  .  not at all  .  i 'm quite easygoing  .  
 what 's your strong points  ?  
 oh  i 'm very responsible  i can make fast decisions  and i do not need much supervision  .  i enjoy completing challenging tasks  .  
 what do you dislike most about your job  ?  
 probably routine  dull work  .  oh  i am much more enthusiastic if i 'm given a challenge and responsibility  .  
 what kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee  ?  
 a friendly one  .  i think an open  friendly  honest relationship should exist  .  an employee should feel she  he  can go to her  his  boss anytime with any kind of question  .  
 sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful  .  foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily  and they show it  .  are you sure you can handle this stress  ?  how do you deal with conflict in your present job  ?  
 well  there 's a lot of stress in a chinese company also  although much of it is below the surface  .  i have confidence in my ability to handle conflict  .  if i have a problem with a coworker  i do everything i can to work it out directly with that person  .  if i am unable to work it out  then i ask a supervisor to help out  .  if my boss shouts at me  i try not to take it personally  .  i try my best to understand the stress he is under  .  it 's kind of like being in a family  .  often family members say things in the heat of the moment  but do n't mean what they say  .  a company is like a family  it has good times and bad times  .  
 how do you feel about overtime work  ?  
 that 's no problem  .  i know that every company has busy periods  .  when this happens  i 'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done  .  
 what is most important to you in a job  ?  
 i want to feel that i am making a real contribution to the company  so i would like my boss to trust me with important work  .  
 do you think that you are introverted or extroverted  ?  
 i 'm quite outspoken  .  i enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way  .  so i 'd call myself outgoing  .  
 under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper  ?  
 seldom  .  but i hate someone 's frequently being late or lazy  .  
 ok  .  what are your strong points  ?  
 hmm  .  as i mentioned  i can work well under pressure and i enjoy work that challenges me  .  i think that my english ability is also a strong point  .  
 and your weaknesses  ?  
did you hear something  ?  
 oh  it is my cell phone ringing  .  i set it in the vibration mode  .  
 it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate  .  it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices  .  
 you are right  .  some ring tone is just terribly loud  .  you can hear it even in the next door  .  it is really a kind of distraction  .  
 maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done  .  
hi  i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won  t be working till tomorrow  .  a technician has just come and checked it  .  he will bring me a new one tomorrow  .  it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing  .  can i use the one in your office  ?  
 of course you can  .  i am sure this one works very well  .  i just sent dozens of pages  .  how many pages are you sending  ?  are you familiar with my fax machine  ?  
 yes  i think you have the same model as i have  .  does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol  ?  
i can  t make out anything  the words are too light  .  i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month  .  
 it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax  .  
 ok  no problem  .  we do it ourselves  .  
 do you know how to do it  ?  i am not so good at machine things  .  i will have somebody do it as soon as possible  .  
i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate  .  may i ask why i was defeated  ?  
 we have thought of you carefully with discretion  but the other candidate has more experiences  .  
 experience is important  but do n't you think capability is more valuable than that  ?  
 yes  i think so  .  but how do you prove to me that you are more capable  ?  
 maybe you can hire me on trial  .  if i 'm not qualified for the job  you can let me go  .  
look  the printer isn  t functioning well  .  i  ve pushed the start button  .  it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log  .  what  s going on  ?  
 let me check  .  it has a paper jam  .  
 i didn  t pay attention to that  .  i will try to get the paper out  .  
hello  mr  .  hao  .  i am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee  .  sorry  .  
 although i am a little shocked  i can deal with it pretty well  .  i did n't perform as well as i should have in the interview  .  
 maybe  .  but you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once  .  
i am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company  .  
 it is tough to accept it  i mean  .  but can you tell me why  ?  
 it is hard to tell  .  maybe it is because you 're not resourceful enough to be a manager  .  
i am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company  .  
 i really appreciate your offer  but i have to decline it  because i have already taken another job which i prefer to work in  .  
 you are welcome  please call me if you change your mind  .  
hello  is that miss lan  ?  this is nina with huawei corp  .  
 yes  speaking  .  
 i 'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us  .  
 oh  i 'm sorry  but i 've just accepted another offer that i feel is more suitable to my needs  .  
i take care of the letters  .  i may read  sort out and organize incoming mails  .  
 so you have to open all the envelopes  .  
 yes  except the personal mail  .  and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the email box regularly  .  
 do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them  ?  
mr  .  carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the shangrila hotel at  this evening  .  here 's an invitation for you  .  
 how nice of him  .  i 'll be delighted to go  .  but what time would be convenient  ?  
 if you could be ready by  say  o 'clock  i 'll be at the hotel to pick you up  .  
 that 's great  .  it 's most thoughtful of you to do this  miss rose  .  
 it 's my pleasure  .  well  then  .  i 'll say goodbye  .

 not bad  .  i 'm confident  .  and i like challenges  .  
 i believe you are cut out for this position  .  you 're an outstanding individual  .

 how should i get their contact info  .  
 get the clients contact info from my rolodex  .  
 where should i put them up  ?  
 how about the holiday inn  ?  
 the clients like the shangrila hotel more  .  
 well  the client is always right  .  
 what else would i prepare  sir  ?  
 please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over  .  
 certainly  .  
 and make sure to return my rolodex to my desk when you are done with it  .  
susan  can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in china  ?  
 well  as per capital income goes up and up  the growth sector seems to be in the highend  .  
 retail is going upscale here  ?  china is certainly growing more quickly than i had imagined  .  
 yes  .  things certainly have changed since i was a boy  .  we 've developed very quickly  .  
 do you think the trend will continue  ?  
 i do n't see why not  .  we do have some problems  but we are still willing to work hard and wages are n't too high at this point  .  
jane  the meeting is scheduled from  this afternoon  .  have you made the necessary arrangements  ?  
 yes  mr  .  miller  .  we 'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting  .  
 that 's right  .  the meeting is very important  .  where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins  ?  
 in the dining room  .  it 's spacious there  .  
 we 'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting  .  
 i 've arranged for an interpreter to be present  .  but it is said these foreigners could speak english  .  
 really  ?  i 'll also try to speak slowly  .  how would you arrange the guests seats  jane  ?  
 we 've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by  .  what time would you like refreshments served  mr  .  miller  ?  
 well  after my report  there will be an interval for rest and refreshments  .  
hello  mr  .  wang  .  i am glad to meet you here at the fair  .  
 like wise  .  take a seat  please  .  how about a cup of tea  ?  
 sure  .  thank you  .  it seems your business is prosperous  .  there are many customers here  .  
 yes  it 's not too bad  .  our sales are going up year after year  .  and we still have a large potential production capacity  .  
 well  what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales  ?  
 that 's a good idea  .  so far  we have several agents abroad  .  
 we are willing to be your agent in thailand for handheld tools  .  what do you think  ?  
 that sounds good  .  
 then  what 's your usual commission rate for your agents  ?  
 usually  we give a commission of   to our agents  .  
   is too low  i think  .  you see  we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion  such as advertising on radio or tv  printing booklets  leaflets  catalogues and so on  .  it all costs money    is not enough  .  
 do n't worry  .  we 'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase  .  
 you mean to saya 
 it sounds ok  .  then how do you pay the commission  ?  
 we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment  .  
 all right  .  if it 's okay  we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately  .  
 think it over  .  we hope to keep a good business relationship with you  .  
that was a very interesting presentation  ms  .  wang  .  my colleagues and i are very impressed with your proposal  .  
 oh  no  surely  .  your ideas were very interesting as well  .  
 to show our appreciation for your hard work  we 'd like to invite you to have dinner with us  .  
 oh  that would be lovely  .  thank you  .  
 excellent  .  have you had french food before  ?  
so  now we have covered all the important points  .  
 yes  i think so  .  
 before we draft the contract  let 's examine the details  .  
 ok  under this contract  we  ll supply you with  dozen tshirts  s  m and l equally assorted  at usd  per dozen  cfr london  .  shipment in july  .  payment by irrevocable sight lc  .  
 perfect  .  but what i  m concerned about most is the time of delivery  
 you may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract  .  but there is also one point i  d like to stress  .  
 yes  ?  
 your lc must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment  otherwise we wo n't be able to catch the ship  .  
 no problem  .  i  ll have the covering lc opened as soon as i wetback  .  in addition  would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment  ?  
 the goods will be inspected by the china import  export commodity inspection bureau  .  it will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight  .  these will be taken as final and biding  .  
 please remember to use both english and chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid  .  
 naturally  .  each of us keeps one original and two copies  .  
 then i  ll come along three days later to put my signature on it  .  
do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff  ?  
 let me see  .  laptop  flash disk  a ballpoint pen  a pencil  a notebook  a pair of glasses  cell phone  charger  moisture lotion   .  .  .  oh  that is too much  .  you are not going to a business trip  .  
 i guess i need all of them  .  
 actually  the company will provide you with all of these supplies  .  so  you can leave this very thick notebook at home  .  
 i know  .  but it is my lucky charm  .  i carry it all the time  .  
are you a social person  ?  
 yes  i am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends  .

 thank you very much for your evaluation  .  i also like this job very much  .  
 i want to know your earliest available entry time  .  
 oh  let me think  .  .  .  maybe two months later  .  
 it 's too late  .  if you could get the job  could you start a little earlier  ?  
 i 'm sorry i ca n't  because i have n't finished my thesis  .  
 what a pity  !  
 when do you usually require the new employee to start  ?  
 within two weeks  because the new employees need to receive induction training  .  
 i will make an arrangement for it  .  
 i hope you can come to our company to work  .  
 i will give you an exact reply as soon as possible  .

 oh  sure  i understand  .  i 'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that i think might best suit a company of your size  .  would it be okay if i called again to see if you have any questions  ?  
 let 's do this  .  since i 'm not sure when i 'll get a chance to read the material  why do n't i give you a call if i have any questions  .  now  i 'm really sorry  but i have to get going to this meeting  .  
 no problem at all  .  i wo n't keep you any longer  .  i 'll put a package to you in the mail and we 'll go from there  .  
 sounds good  .  
 thanks for your time  .  
do you have your own circle of friends  ?  
 yes  .  i have friends even though i am a man of few words  .  just like the old saying goes   actions speak louder than words   .  i am a hardworking silent person  .  
 what you said was right  but we need to work as a team  how could you make adjustment to that  ?  
 teamwork is ok to me  and i hope the team will be complementary in personality  .  
what kind of strong suit do you get  ?  
 i am accomplished in english and computer  .  besides  i 've got a teacher 's certificate  .

 we will let you know probably next monday  .  i hope to give you a positive reply  .  
what are your strengths and weaknesses  ?

 what is your problem in working  ?  
i have a little trouble  and i do n't know how to deal with it  .  
 what 's the matter  ?  please tell me  .  maybe i can help you  .  
 tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him  but i do n't know how to write it  .  
 do n't worry  .  i know about this  .  
 really  ?  tell me without delay  .  
 first you should have a salutation  which can be the company 's or a person's name  .  
 well  i see  .  
 then you can write about his performance in college  including his academic achievements and his competence  .  
 it 's easy to write those  .  
 you can also state his personality traits  hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on  .  
 tom got along well with classmates  .  he is really a good boy  .  
 you can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter  .  
 what should i write except these  ?  
 you should also state that you are his class president  so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter 
what do you consider to be your weakness  ?  
 i am a little bit shy and i blush every time i speak in public  .  i think i should open myself more and be more outward with people  .  
 anything else  ?  
so  monica  how do you like your new office  ?  
 well  i love it  .  the room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine  .  there are plants along the corridor  .  especially  i got my own desk with computer and telephone  .  such a great place  !  
 that  s very good  .  i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful  .  
 what was so bad about it  ?  
 small rooms  small window  a small desk shared by three people  .  i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work  .  
 sounds bad  !  lucky you  !  you didn  t take that job  .  i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently  .  
good morning  this is mary  .

 it is just too much  .  don  t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way  ?

 thank you  .  
 your main duty is to answer the phone calls and transfer them to the person wanted  .  
 i see . what if the person wanted is out  ?

 is there anything else i should do  ?  
 yes  you are responsible for keeping all files in order  .  
 all right  .  
 if you have any questions  .  i will help you  .

good morning . wilson association  .  
 this is mr brown speaking  .  i 'd like to speak to mr  .  thomas  please  .  
 i 'm sorry  but mr . thomas left the office a few minutes ago  .  
 that 's bad  !  i 've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes  but your line has been busy . will he be back soon  ?  
 i 'm afraid not . he s gone for the rest of the day  .  
 is there anywhere i can reach him  ?  
 i do n't believe so . he s going out of town on business . may i take a message  ?  
 i have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o 'clock  but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it  .  
 would you care to make another appointment  ?  
 unfortunately  i 'm leaving town rather unexpectedly  and i may be gone for several days  .  
 i see  .  i can tell mr . thomas that you phoned  .  
 thank you  .  
my name is helen levin  .  i 'm the hr director of our company  .  
 miss levin  .  nice to meet you  .  
i 'd like to speak dr . johnson  .  
 sorry  but he 's not in  .  may i take a message for you  ?  
 this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back  please  ?  
good morning  sir . can i help you  ?  
 yes  i 'd like to see the manager . here s my card  .  
 thank you  mr . wang . do you have an appointment  ?  
 no  i 'm afraid i do n't  .  is it possible for me to see him now  ?  
 i 'm afraid mr . li is engaged at the moment  .  would you mind waiting  ?  
 well  how long will it be  ?  
 about half an hour  .  
 that 's too bad  .  i ca n't wait that long  .  i have another appointment at ten  .  
 can the assistant manager meet you instead  ?  
 no  i have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday  .  
 do you want to make another appointment  ?  
 yes  i suppose that 's the best thing i can do for now  .  i 'll be here on thursday morning at  o 'clock  .  is that all right  ?  
um  which of them is the better typist  ?  
 well  mary types faster than jones  .  but i think jones types more carefully  .  
 is there any difference in their short hand  ?  
 jones can certainly take down letter more quickly  but mary  s short hand is the best in her class  .  
 how about languages  ?  
 both of them speak excellent french  .  but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does  .  
gordon  you 're ever so late  .  
 yes  i am sorry  .  i missed the bus  .  
 but there 's a bus every ten minutes  and you are over  hour late  .  
 well  i missed several buses  .  
 how on earth can you miss several buses  ?  
 i  ah  .  .  .   i got have late  .  
 oh  come on  gordon  it 's the afternoon now  .  why were you late really  ?  
 well  i  .  .  .  i lost my wallet  and i  .  .  .  
 have you got it now  ?  
 yes  i found it again  .  
 when  ?  
 this morning  .  i mean  .  .  .  
good morning  .  wilson association  .  
 this is mr brown speaking  .  i 'd like to speak to mr  .  thomas  please  .  
 i 'm sorry  but mr . thomas left the office a few minutes ago  .  
 that 's bad  !  i 've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes  but your line has been busy  .  will he be back soon  ?  
 i 'm afraid not  .  he 's gone for the rest of the day  .  
 is there anywhere i can reach him  ?  
 i do n't believe so  .  he 's going out of town on business  .  may i take a message  ?  
 i have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o 'clock  but i 'm afraid i ca n't make it  .  
 would you care to make another appointment  ?  
 unfortunately  i 'm leaving town rather unexpectedly  and i may be gone for several days  .  
 i see  .  i can tell mr . thomas that you phoned  .  
 thank you  .  
how is the project going  ?  
 well  frankly speaking  i am running a little behind  .  it 's   done  .  
 do you have any problem during the process  ?  you should speed things up  .  
 i have little chance to communicate with colleagues when i have problems  .  they are always too busy to help a green hand like me  .  
 have you ever helped others when they are in trouble  ?  most will give a hand to someone who has helped him  .  
 i did  .  but i am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me  .  
 and you should have good cooperation with other colleagues  you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work  .  
 i see your point  but i seem to be on bad terms with them  .  
 cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better  .  i am speaking from my experience  .  
 thank you so much  .  
 and you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge  .  
 that 's a good idea  .  i can learn many useful things from books  .  
 we 're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project  .  you 'd better speed up and catch up with books  .  
 well  i will do it better  .  
 if you have any problem in your work  let me know  .  
we have achieved great success last year . the most important is that we realize our strength lies in aftersale service  .  
 your achievement is obvious to all  .  
 what we will do is to strengthen it  .  
this is our rockbottom price  mr  .  lee  .  
 if that 's the case  .  there 's not much point in further discussion  .  we might as well call the whole deal off  .  
 what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price  .  the gap is too great  .  
 i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible  .  how about meeting each other halfway  ?  
 what 's your proposal  ?  
 your unit price is  dollars higher than we want  .  well  i suggest we meet each other halfway  .  
 do you mean a further reduction of  dollars in our price  ?  that 's impossible  !  
 what would you suggest  ?  
 the best we can do is another  dollars off  .  that 's definitely the lowest we can go  .  
 that still leaves a gap of  dollars  .  let 's meet each other halfaway again and split the difference  i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with  .  
mr  .  smith  .  could you give me your quotation for your bicycle a  fob qingdao  ?  
 can you tell me how many you want to buy  ?  
  for immediate delivery  and  in two months time . that s by the end of july 
 well  .  then   yuan each  .  
 since this is a sizeable order  i was thinking you might give us a   discount  .  
 i 'm afraid we ca n't go as high as that  .  you know we usually do n't give any discount  .  but considering the newly established business relationship between us  i could give you   off the list price  .  
 only    ?  that 's not much  .  if you could make some concessions  we would probably buy some of your other products  .  
 ok  .  ok  .  i do n't want to haggle with you  .  let 's say  how about  .    ?  
here 's our sample room  .  
 you 've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here  .  
 yes  .  we are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries  .  and the demand is getting greater and greater . by the way  which items are you interested in  ?  
 i 'm particularly interested in shortbreads  .  do you have some samples you could show me  ?  
 yes  .  this way  please  .  our shortbread is in a variety of flavors  such as almond  walnut  lotus seed  etc  .  and different packaging has different weights  .  we can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require  .  
 the small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us  .  i wonder if your pastry tastes better  .  
 you are welcome to have a try  .  here it is  .  ours is of prime quality  .  
i was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years  .  what kinds of products do you generally handle  ?  
 we mostly handle office furniture  .  we supply firstclass furniture  .  here are our catalogue and the pattern books  .  you can see the material is superior and with all the latest styles  .  can you give me some idea about what you 're looking for  ?  
 you know  we want to totally furnish our new office building  .  this is a list of what we need  .  could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list  ?  
 the price varies somewhat according to the size of your order  .  would you tell us the quantity you want so that we can work out an offer  ?  
 if the furniture is pleasantly designed and highquality stuff  we intend to buy several thousand sets  .  
 it 's our pleasure to do business with you  .  we 'll let you have the offer next wednesday at the latest  .  
how was your appraisal with the boss  ?  
 oh it was really good  .  do you know  he  s the nicest boss i  ve had here  .  
 yes  i think he  s the most relaxed person in management  .  
 what  s more  he said i was the hardest working person in the office  !  
 that  s good  .  maybe you  ll get promoted  .  
it is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties  .  
 yes  .  we 're satisfied with the result  .  
we look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future  .  
 thank you for your consideration  .  we will inform you of our intention as soon as possible  .  
we wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes  .  
 we are interested in this field  .  
we hope that our cooperation will continue  .  
 of course  .  we both experienced a good cooperation  .  
i am thinking about resigning from my current job  .  
 have you thought about it seriously  ?  
 yes  i have been thinking about it for quite a while  .  now i finally make up my mind to leave  .  i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday  .  
 ok  did you find a new company  ?  
 yes  i will move on to xyz company  .  
 good for you  but your leaving will be a great loss to us  .  it is so nice to work with you  .  
what is the most enjoyable part about your job  ?  
 i think meeting people  .  there are people from all over the country  all over the world  all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job  .  
 what do you find annoying  ?  
hello  this is francis from xyz company  .  i would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week  .  do you have time to meet  ?  
 well  i am not sure  .  lets me check my agenda 
 ok  .  
 i am free on tuesday afternoon from  pm to  pm  is it convenient for you  ?  
 it is ok with me  .  so i will be arriving at your office around  fifteen pm  .  do you have a projector in your room  ?  i would like to show you some related charts 
can i ask for leave this afternoon  ?  
 what is the problem  ?  
 i had a headache this morning  .  i didn  t pay attention to it  .  i thought probably it is because i didn  t sleep well  .  but now it is getting worse and worse  .  i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very lightsensitive  .  maybe it is the migrated  .  
 it is ok  .  you look really pale and red eyes  .  i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest  .  
i would like to ask for one day off next week  .  do you think the manager will agree  ?  i know it is the busy time for our company  but i do have some important things to handle  .  
 well  it is hard to say  .  at least you need to come up with a good reason  .  
 actually  it is my mother  s wedding  .  my parents divorced many years ago  .  now she is ready to establish a new family  .  it is a special occasion  .  i 've got to be there  right  ?  
 yes  you should be there  .  go find the manager and ask  .  i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off  .  don  t forget to fill in the leave application form  .  it will be signed by the manager for approval  .  
you must be very busy these days  .  i heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time  .  it can be the most important meeting for our company this year  .  
 sure it is  .  i am up to my ears as time expressed  .  
 do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time  ?  you remember  ?  i like that one  .  
 if we were in the same conference room  i would not work late these days  .  that conference room has been booked out  .  this time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company  .  so everything has to be rearranged and checked  like tables  chairs  mean tacks  podium  audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu  .  
what sort of job would you like to take  ?  
 i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator  .  
 we need an operator now  .  
you must like negotiating a lot  .  people are saying  you are a super negotiator  .  
 ha  i am flattered  .  actually  when it comes to negotiate  you don  t need to like it  .  you just need to understand how it works  .  
 i am not good at it by any means  .  give me some advice  .  
 well  generally speaking  if you want to change someone  s mind or understand his position  you have to put yourself in his shoes  .  understand his need and the cost for his need  .  and then you work together to find a solution  .  
 sounds easy  .  but how can i apply to practice  ?  i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill  .  but i am afraid our boss will turn me down  .  
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful  .  we just made a record sale this season  .  
 that is very encouraging news  .  i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research  they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month  .  that is to say  the r  d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market  .  
 it is not an easy job  .  how do you like the advertisement for the new product  ?  
 that is the best one i have seen  .  i am sure our target customers  young people will love it  .  
here is the document you asked for this morning  .  
 oh  you are so efficient  .  i thought you might give it to me tomorrow  .  thanks  .  
 you  re welcome  .  you know  these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination  .  the more i think about it  the more i hate myself for being so disorganized  .  i decided to change the situation as soon as possible  .  otherwise i will be more regretful later  .  
 this is encouraging news  good for you  !  what is your solution  then  ?  
 the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities  .  it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place  .  
why do you want to be a stewardess  ?  
 i have always enjoyed flying  .  and i am good with people  .  
 could you handle flying for  hours straight  ?  
 yes  i can adjust to anything  .  
 that 's good  .  
 i am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid  .  
 you should very qualified  .  
first of all  thank you for accepting this job  .

 do i have paid vacation  ?  
do you have any other questions  ?  
 yes  may i ask something about the salary and benefits in your company  ?  
 according to our regulations  you will be on probation for the first three months  .

 in this period  you can only get the basic salary   yuan per month  .  
 that sounds fine  .

 are there paid holidays  ?

 they usually go on for ages  .  
 i  ll stop by if i have time later  .  make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines  .  
excuse me  .  do you mind if i ask some things about work for this company  ?  
 not at all  .  go ahead  .  
 i 've heard that the company is very strict with its staff  .  is that true  ?  
 not really  so long as you follow all the regulations  .  
 if you make mistakes in your job  you 'll be fired  .  is that right  ?  
 no  .  everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes  .  the most important thing is to be responsible for your work  .  
 working here involves a busy schedule and overtime  .  is that true  ?  
 yes  .  that 's true  .  we are always busy  .  the company attaches great importance to high efficiency  .  sometimes we have to work overtime  but not always  .  and we have extra pay for extra work  .  
how could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university  ?  
 i  m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in  .  perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview  .  
 that  s a good idea  .  we could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events  .  it would be quite cheap to do on the campus  .  
 it will be expensive to do outside the campus  .  perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship  .  
 we could contact alumni who work for large  wellknow companies  .  they might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets  .  
 good thinking  !  we should also print some leaflets for students to distribute  .  
 we should put some information about it on the home page of our university website  .  when people visit the website  they  ll see the information  .  
 we could take out some advertisements to local newspapers  .  i checked the prices and they are reasonable  .  
the demographic reports are in  .  .  .  from the looks of it  we 're going to have to reevaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues  .  
 why  what 's the lowdown  ?  
 according to the report  our boston crowd is quite different makeup from our chicago folks  .  our boston consumers are mostly from midlevel to upperclass income levels  university or postgraduates  married no children  white collar  .  .  .  you know the kind  .  chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels  single parent homes  blue collar  .  .  .  i think we 're talking about two totally different target groups  .  
 i have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues  .  .  .  to make our products sell  we have to take the target audience into account  .  
excuse me  could you please show me the way to the human resource department  ?  
 yeah  but have you made an appointment ahead  ?  
 yes  of course  .  i am monica  .  i have made an appointment with your hr manager  .  
 just a minute please  .  i  ll make a call to the hr office  .  yes  they confirm your appointment  .  please come in  .  it is on the rd floor  room   .  you can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today  .  
 thank you very much  .  
how come it is slow as a snail today  ?  
 you mean the network connection  ?  
 yes  i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now  .  it took me almost one minute to open it  .  then there is no response to any click  .  
 i have the same question  .  i can  t send out mails  .  we  d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately  .  
what 's holding us back on the plant expansion project  ?  we were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago . why have n't i heard anything about it  ?  did the whole project just vanish into thin air  ?  
 no  sir  .  the plant expansion project has been delayed . there was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits . it seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species  .  
 you 're joking  right  ?  no wonder we 've been tied up with this project  .  i know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they 've found anything endangered on the site  .  are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there  ?  
how long will it take for our order to be delivered  ?  
 let 's see  .  you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china  .  they should be able to place your order before the end of next week  .  it will take  days for shipping to the port city of ningpo  .  the freight will take  weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today  .  domestic shipping will be your responsibility  you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles  .  
 fine  we will handle domestic shipping  but what about customs  ?  will we have to pay tariff on our imports  ?  i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control  .  
last month  we only had  hits on our site  .  our products and prices are good  but the problem is that no one knows about our website  .  
 if we want to get this internet business off the ground  we 've got to do something fast  .  
 we need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists  but i 'm not sure how to do it  .  
 we 've got to put more buzz words into the page text  so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products  .  
 yeah  you 're right  .  we 've got to get the most popular phrases there  .  .  .  how else can we boost site traffic  ?  
 i think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs  .  if they have related services  they may be willing to help us out  .  
have you seen the sales report for last quarter  ?  who do you think is our digest threat  ?  
 from the numbers  it seems like forest inc  .  is our digest competitor  .  .  .  le 'ban and markford are also major contenders in our market  .  
 le 'ban is the new kid on the block  it 's amazing they 've had such tremendous success so soon  .  .  .  with them on the scene  the competition is outthrough  .  
 here 's information about our competitor 's recent market activities  .  .  .  
 thanks  this will be a big help in putting together next quarter 's marketing strategies  .  with competition this intense  we 'll have to step up production even more  .  we need a price we can compete with  .  
 we 're in a very competitive environment  .  it 's sink or saimin this market  .  
how much do you have budgeted for our trip to las angeles  ?  
 in total  it should be about   for the week conference  .  would you like to see the breakdown  ?  
 yes  i want to know exactly where the money is going  .  give me a detailed report  .  
 first we have the airline tickets  which are   per person  with four of us going  that 's t    .  for our accommodations  we 're spending   a night  per room  for five days  .  that 's another    .  
 weren  t you able to find anything less expensive  ?  we 're sharing rooms  right  ?  
 i have two people to a room  .  the   room rate is the lowest i could find  .  with the conference going on that week  all the hotels have inflated their prices  they 're making a killing  .  
 so far we have    what else  ?  
 i have budget   per peron per day for food expenses  .  that totals another    .  and for other incidentals  like take fees  and tips  i have estimated about    .  
 well  that 's only    .  did n't you tell me your budget was    ?  where is the rest of the money  ?  
how did your company 's fundraiser go  ?  
 the fundraiser events went really well  .  we were able to partner with a few of our competitors  all in fun of course  to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society  .  all of the people who participated it had a great time  and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research  .  
 so how does it work  ?  how were you able to make money with the marathon  ?  
 each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee  .  also  they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran  .  all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars  .  
 sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society  .

 yes  .  
liz  do you have a minute  ?  
 yes  of course  .  what is it  ?  
 i need you to help me set up for my presentation thursday morning  .  
 okay  what should i do  ?  
 well  it is n't at this office  .  it 's over at the dayton street office . have you been there before  ?

 well  i need the display monitor . but tom can set that up for me on wednesday  .  i will need you to help with everything else  .  
excuse me  i am dunlin  .  i am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide  .  are there still any vacancies  ?  
 yes  .  one more is needed  .  
 oh  i 'm so lucky  .  i want to apply for it  .  
 but do you have any experience like that  ?  
 yes  .  i have been a guide for two years  .  
 ok . then i want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide . if there wasn accident  for example a tourist falls ill  what would you do  ?  
 i think i will call the office to send someone to meet us  and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip  .  
 if one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant  would you let the tourist bus go back  ?  
 no  .  in fact  prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus  i will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings  .  
 well  it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases  .  i am very glad to welcome you into our company  .  
this facility is great  do n't you think  ?  
 yes  it is better than last year  .  they have done a very good job this time  .  
 i 'm glad our booth is on the first floor  .  more people can see our display  .  
 if someone wants to find us  they can look at this floor plan . it shows where all the companies have their booths  .  
 let me see that  .  i did n't get one when i came in  .  
 really  ?  they did n't give you one with your ticket  ?  
 no  .  
 that 's strange  .  
 where do you go for lunch around here  ?  
 are you hungry  ?  
 not too bad  .  but i will be soon  .  
 i went across the street  .  there is a good chinese restaurant next to the hotel  .  
 i ca n't see cortex on this floor plan  .  do n't they have a booth here  ?  
 they must  .  let me look at that . here it is  .  cortex  .  it 's on the second floor  next to the roll booth  .  
 oh  that will be uncomfortable for them  .  
 for whom  ?  cortex  ?  
 yes  .  cortex just stole darren mcdowell from rolly . and probably darren will be here . so he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old cortex coworkers  .  
 i 've never met darren . but you 're right  .  that would probably be uncomfortable  .  
 when you reserve a booth  you should check who your neighbors will be . don t you think  ?  
 yes  maybe  .  if you 're darren mcdowell  you should probably check  .  
 yes  .  well  i think i 'll go get lunch  .  will you join me  ?  
 no  i 'll stay here at the booth  .  i ate earlier  .  are you going to the chinese restaurant  ?  
well  yuri  tell me about it  .  
 i 'm sorry i ca n't bring better news  sir  .  the site is a disaster  .  
 that 's what i was afraid of  .  
 it is not only the earthquake  sir  .  but the mudslides . much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud  .  
 mud  ?  but ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district  .  i thought all the mudslides were down in chichitango  .  
 that 's what we thought  sir  .  that 's what the news reported . but there was one little mudslide in our district too  .  right above our site  .  
 oh  that 's terrible  !  what bad luck  !  i wish we had never come to this country . but  if it is n't the strikes and the revolutionaries  it 's the earthquakes . our operations here are finished  !  
 i 'm sorry  sir  .  
 it 's not your fault  yuri . but tell me  .  when will ivan be able to get out there  ?  
 well  it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . if ivan leaves tonight  i think he should be there by tomorrow lunch  .  
 good  .  i want an estimate of damages as soon as possible  .  
 but sir  .  .  .  
 yes  yuri  ?  
 i would n't recommend sending ivan now . especially not at night  .  the roads are n't safe  .  
 has the earthquake damaged the bridges too  ?  
 no  sir  .  the bridges are fine . but i 've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . there has been fighting  sir  .  
 are you serious  ?  fighting  ?  but i did n't hear anything on the news  .  
 you know the government controls the press here  sir  .  they do n't want it reported  .  
 oh  this is terrible  yuri  .  terrible  !  so we ca n't even assess the damages  .  how can we do business in this country  ?  either we 're buried under mud  or we 're in danger of getting kidnapped . no  i ca n't believe this mess  !  
 i 'm sorry  sir  .  
excuse me  can you tell me which is bob rice 's office  ?  
 sure  .  it 's the third office down this hall  .  are you looking for bob  ?  
 yes  .  he told me to come by this morning  .  
 i 'm sorry  but he 's not in the office now  .  do you have an appointment  ?  
 an appointment  ?  
 yes  .  what time did he expect you  ?  
 he said i should come by this morning  .  he did n't give me a time . he said i could come any time before noon  .  
 i see  .  he 's usually here on tuesday mornings  .  .  .  
 today is tuesday  .  
 i know  .  he 's usually here  but today he went out to a site on the east side  .  
 that 's too bad  .  i need to discuss these plans with him  .  
 why do n't you make an appointment for later in the week  ?  
 alright  .  
 he 's here on tuesdays  wednesdays and fridays  .  what day did you want to see him  ?  
 friday is good  .  
 morning or afternoon  ?  
 morning  .  
 i can put you down for ten o 'clock  .  is that alright  ?  
 yes  .  my name is laura wills  .  
 alright  .  i have you down for ten am this friday  .  
 thank you  .  
come in  arnold  .  have a seat  .  
 good morning  .  
 would you like something to drink  ?  
 no  thank you  .  i just had two cups of coffee at my desk  .  
 so  you 're a serious coffee drinker  .  
 yes  it keeps me going  .  sometimes i think i 'm addicted  .  
 well  coffee is n't such a bad thing . everyone has to have something . for me  it 's cigars  .  are you a cigar smoker  ?  
 no  i 've tried them  .  but i 'm not really a smoker  .  
 well  what would you like to talk to me about  ?  
 i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal  .  
 i 'm glad when people have new ideas around here  .  tell me about it  .  
 it is about the staff meetings . you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday  .  
 yes  .  
 well  i have been thinking about it . and i believe we could do things more efficiently here  .  
 what do you suggest  ?  
 the way it is now  the staff from all four branches get together once a week . we meet for one hour  .  but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation  .  
 you mean because people have to go across town to get here  .  
 yes  .  some people spend half of the morning on the road  .  
 that 's true  .  but our staff meetings are very important  arnold  .  i do n't know how we can function without them  .  
 i think they are important too . that s why i want people to have a better attitude about them  .  
 i know a lot of people think the meetings are n't too useful  .  i 'm aware of that  .  
 here 's what i propose  .  i think we should meet once every two weeks  but meet for ninety minutes or more  .  
 well  .  
 i also think the meetings should be more focused . and i would be willing to take responsibility for that  .  
 you mean you want to run the meetings  ?  
 no  not really run them  .  but i could help organize them  .  i could discuss meeting topics with you  and then prepare a schedule for each meeting  .  i could then send an email to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . this way the meetings would become more focused  and people would prepare better  .  
 hmm  .  but we would meet every two weeks  .  
 i really think it would work . the meetings could be longer  and better organized  .  
 i am not against the idea  arnold . it may really be more efficient  as you say  .  i 'll tell you what we can do . why do n't we try your proposal for a month  and see how it works  .  
 excellent  .  i would be happy to get started on it  .  
good afternoon  sales department . may i help you  ?  
 could i speak to mr wood  please  ?

kevin  ?  hi  it  s elizabeth  .  i have a big favor to ask you  .  
 how big  elizabeth  ?  last time you said that  i ended up working overtime  nights in a row  !  
 well  i  ve got a huge load of typing and mr  .  blake has insisted i get it done by tomorrow afternoon  .  
can you help me plan the office party  ?  
 sure  .  what do you need the most help with  the food or entertainment  ?  
 i need help with food  .  
 ok  well  let 's coordinate our efforts  .  should this party be formal or casual  ?  
 i think it should be casual  .  
 i agree  .  next  we have to decide on food  .  we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine  .  which one should we have  ?  
 i would prefer chinese food for this party  .  
 perfect choice  .  for music  should we have a live band or a dj  ?  
 i think we should hire a live band  .  
could i meet with you to discuss the project  ?  
 good idea  .  we could meet on monday or tuesday  .  which day would you prefer  ?  
 tuesday would be good for me  .  
 ok  .  do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon  ?  
 i think the afternoon would be best  .  
 that will work out  .  i will email the exact time tomorrow  .  i need you to bring your plans with you  .  
 yes  i will bring my plans with me to the meeting  .  
 should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the subcommittee there  ?  
 i feel that the whole committee needs to be there  .  
 yes  i agree  .  we 'll make sure that they get notified  .  can you find the meeting place  ?  
 yes  i know how to get there on my own  .  
i would like to make an appointment for a project meeting  .  
 of course  i have monday or tuesday available  .  what day would be best for you  ?  
 i would like to meet on monday  .  
 very well then  .  are mornings or afternoons best  ?  
 i want to come in the morning  .  
 i will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time  .  can you bring me an outline of the project when you come  ?  
 yes  i can bring the outline when i come to the meeting  .  
 do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our subcommittee  ?  
 i think that we should have just the subcommittee  .  
 ok then  i will make the arrangements for them to attend  .  do you know how to get there  ?  
 no  i need directions  please  .  
will you tell me the situation  ?  
 i was in my friend 's room  talking for an hour or so  .  
 and then  ?  
 i came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone  .  
 i 'm afraid you must give up the cash  .  are you insured  ?  
 yes  this is my overseas travel accident insurance card  .  
hello  .  excuse me  .  
 yes  .  can i help you  ?  
 do you remember me  ?  i just had lunch here a half hour ago  .  
 of course i remember you  .  
 i think i lost my wallet here  .  
 oh  no  .  really  ?  i did n't see anything  .  
 really  ?  you did n't find a wallet  ?  
 no  i did n't  .  would you like to go look by the table with me  ?  
 yes  i would  .  it 's not here  .  and it 's not on the floor . has anyone sat at this table since we left  ?  
 no  .  it 's been empty the whole time  .  
 hmm  .  i do n't know how it could have happened  .  
 i remember  sir  that your friend took the bill . you did n't pay for the lunch yourself  did you  ?  
 no  .  my friend did  .  
 then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here  ?  
 no  i 'm not sure  .  but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down . it s uncomfortable to sit on it  .  so i usually put it next to me on the table  .  
 maybe you lost it before you came here  .  or maybe you left it at home  .  
 i do n't think it 's at home  .  i think i had it when i left the house . but what should i do  ?  
 well  the first thing you should do is make sure it 's not at home . then  if it is n't  you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards  .  next  you need to replace whatever you lost  your driver 's license  things like that  .  
 should i call the police  ?  
 you can if you want  .  but the police usually do n't do anything about lost wallets  .  
 hmm  .  i 'll go home and check  .  maybe you 're right  .  maybe it 's at home  .  
 i 'm sorry we could n't find it  sir  .  
oh  my god  !  what 's this  ?  
 what  ?  
 look  !  this window is open  .  
 did you open it before we left  ?  
 are you kidding  ?  it 's winter  .  why would i open it  ?  
 i do n't know  .  wait  .  is this yours  ?  
 no  !  oh  my god  !  someone has broken into the house  .  
 it looks that way  .  that 's probably why the door was n't locked when we came in  .  
 i locked it when i left though  .  
 yes  but the robber broke in . then  when he left  he left through the door  .  so it was n't locked  .  
 i do n't care about that  allen  !  what did he steal  ?  that 's the question  !  
 look around  .  
 the tv 's still here  .  
 and your stereo too  .  so what did he steal  ?  we have to go look upstairs  .  
 but what if someone 's still up there  ?  
there 's someone coming  .  
 it took them four minutes to get here  .  that was pretty fast  .  
 yes  it 's fast  .  but four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage  .  
 i guess the fire was n't in the tool shed after all . it looks like the back of the house was burning  .  
 i wonder if anyone can call the ridleys about this  .  do you know them well  ?  
 not really  .  
 do you know where they 're vacationing  ?  
 i think they went to mexico  but i 'm not sure . it s a bad thing to return home to . they ll come home from their trip  and they 'll see half their house burned  .  
 yes  but at least this way no one gets hurt . it s better to have a fire in your house when you 're not home  .  do n't you think  ?  
hi  !  what are you watching  ?  
 it  s a programme about islam  .  it  s very interesting  .  
 wow  !  so many people  !  where are they and what are they doing  ?  
 they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca  .  muslims call this pilgrimage haj  .  
 why do they go there  ?  
 muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life  .  mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith  .  
 when muslims pray  they face towards mecca  .  
 that  s right  .  unfortunately  so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed  .  
 i heard about that  .  the pilgrims must walk around a large  sacred black stone  .  
 that  s right  .  that  s when accidents often happen  .  the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims  to reduce the chances of accidents  .  
 pilgrimages are common in many faiths  .  
 yes  .  in england  christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages  .  
 isn  t there a place in france where people go to get healed  ?  
 i think that place is lourdes  .  there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there  .  
 do you think that there is something magical about that place  ?  
are you watching another news report about the war  ?  
 yes  .  the two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today  .  several military target were destroyed by bombing  .  many civilians were among the dead and wounded  .  
 how did this war start  ?  
 bout side claim a small area of territory  .  both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other  .  
 politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent  .  neither side wants to compromise  .  
 relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter  .  several european countries have agreed to send aid  but are afraid that their planes will be shot down  .  
 what do you think will happen  ?  
 both countries are very poor  .  soon they will run out of money to finance the war  .  then  perhaps  they will negotiate  .  
why are you holding me in this jail cell  ?  
hey there  how are you doing  ?  
 i am great  .  how are you  ?  
 well  i got laid off  and i  m looking for work  .  
 yeah  me too  !  what are you thinking you would like to do  ?  
 right now  i  ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage  .  
 have you gone out on any interviews so far  ?  
 i went out on one interview  but i haven  t heard back from them  .  
 did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program  ?  
 you know  i saw that and it looks pretty good  !  
will they send me a form telling me that i have been granted unemployment  ?  
 a notice of unemployment insurance award letter will be sent to you  .  
 what information will be in that letter  ?  
 the award letter will inform you as to how much you will receive  .  
 what other forms will i need to turn in  ?  
 every two weeks you will receive a continued claim form that you must turn in  .  
 what will they be asking me on that form  ?  
 you must show that you were available and that you looked for work  .  
 what else will they ask me  ?  
will i get notification that i qualify for unemployment  ?  
 the employment development office will send you a notice of unemployment insurance award letter  .  
 what is contained in that letter  ?  
 in addition to telling you how much you will receive  the beginning and ending dates of your claim will be included  .  
 will the award letter tell me what i need to fill out next  ?  
 you will receive a continued claim form and every two weeks  you must turn it in  .  
 when i fill out the continued claim form  what will i need to tell them  ?  
 you must show where and when you tried to look for work  .  if you earned any money  you need to tell them about it  .  
 what other information does the form ask for  ?  
i am calling to find out why i didn  t receive an unemployment check this week  .  
 did you send in your continued claim form for the last period  ?  
 i think i forgot to send it in  !  
 you need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid  .  
 can i send it in now  ?  
 you should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due  .  if it hasn  t been  we will still accept it  .  
 can i mail it in early next time so it isn  t late  ?  
 actually  you cannot mail it in early  as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date  .  
 will my paycheck come right away now  ?  
is there someone i can talk to about a payment question  ?  
 yes  we can handle that here  .  how can i help you  ?  
 my paycheck that just arrived is less than last week  s check  .  
 did you work at all during the last pay period  ?  
 yes  actually  i did make a little bit of money  .  
 did you report it on your continued claim form  ?  
 yes  i showed that income on the continued claim form  .  
 well  we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week  s check  .  
 maybe i just shouldn  t show the income then  .  
could you help me figure out why i am missing my unemployment check for this week  ?  
 i hope that you remembered to send in your last continued claim form  .  
 i am pretty sure that i didn  t send that claim form in  .  
 you have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you  .  
 can i mail it in late  ?  
 if it is not more than fourteen days past its due date  then you may still mail it in  .  
 i think that i will mail it in right away when i get it next time  so i won  t be late  .  
 you can  t mail it in early because you don  t know  in advance  how much you will be working  .  
 even though i was late turning in my form  will my paycheck be late  ?  
i was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question i have about my payment  .  
 i would be happy to answer any questions you might have  .  
 my paycheck seems to be smaller than the one i received last week  .  
 what about income  ?  did you make any money during that period  ?  
 my old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period  .  
 when you filled out your continued claim form  did you show that income  ?  
 of course i wrote down the work that i had done on the continued claim form  .  
 what happens is  when you make money  we take part of your benefits away  .  
 i am not going to show any income from now on then  .  
i have a question about my payment and need someone to help me  .  
 yes  i would be happy to answer a question about payment  .  what do you need help with  ?  
 i can  t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week  s  .  
 did you generate any income during that time period  ?  
 i made a little bit of money  but not much  .  
 did that income show up on your last continued claim form  ?  
 i claimed the work i did on the last continued claim form  .  
 when you are able to find work and get paid  we always take away part of your check  .  
 that being the case  i don  t think that i am going to show the income next time  .  
well  mr  .  brooks  .  i  m sorry  again  for the delay  but we should have everything completed by the time you get back  .  
 i certainly hope so  .  can we arrange to meet on the th  ?  that should give you enough time  .  
 yes  sir  .  that  s more than enough time  .  i do appreciate your understanding  .  why don  t we say  o  clock on the th  ?  
i didn  t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why  .  
 did you mail us your last continued claim form  ?  
 i am afraid that i forgot to send it in  .  
 we cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks  .  
 is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now  ?  
 it can  t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it  .  
 i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem  .  
 you can  t possibly know in advance how much you will be working  .  if you mail it in too soon  we will reject it  !  
 will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form  ?  
did you vote yesterday  ?  
 i sure did  !  
 what candidate did you vote for  ?  
 i voted for obama  .  
 i  m shocked he actually won  .  
 i knew he would win  .  
 how  d you know  ?  
 he was the best candidate this year  .  
 what about him being black  ?  
 i guess america is finally maturing  .  
i am so excited  !  
 excited about what  ?  
 i just voted  .  
 is this the first time you  ve voted  ?  
 yes  i just had my th birthday this year  .  
 that  s lucky  .  
 why is that  ?  
 you turned  in an election year  .  
 i didn  t think about it like that  .  
 really  ?  
 no  but that makes me even more excited  .  
can you tell that i  m excited  ?  
 what are you excited about  ?  
 i voted today  .  
 was this your first time  ?  
 i just turned  a month ago  .  
 you  re lucky  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 because you turned  in an election year  .  
 i didn  t even think of that  .  
 you didn  t  ?  
 i really didn  t  but i  m still excited  .  
did you vote  ?  
 of course  !  
 who was your vote for president  ?  
 my vote was for barack obama  .  
 i didn  t expect him to win  .  
 i had no doubt in my mind that he would win  .  
 what made you think that  ?  
 nobody could compete with him  .  
 i thought his race would have kept him from winning  .  
 times are changing  .  
 that  s true  .  
national trust  .  
 my name is alice lin  and i need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet  .  
 just one second  and i 'll check  .  
union bank  .  how can i be of service  ?  
 i need to know how much money is in my account  .  
 i 'll need your name and account number  .  
you voted  right  ?  
 you know i did  .  
 who did you vote for  ?  
 i voted for obama  of course  !  
 can you believe that he actually won  ?  
 i knew he would win  .  
 i didn  t think he would  .  
 he was the top candidate  .  
 i figured people wouldn  t vote for him because he  s african american  .  
 that just goes to show that america is finally turning over a new leaf  .  
 you  re absolutely right  .  
hello  there  .  you are looking a little confused  can i help you with something  ?  
 well  i 've always used the bank book  but now i have this card  .  i do n't know how to use it in the machine  .  
 do n't worry  i can help you with that  .  i understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving  .  the first thing we need to do is check the atm is in service  .  this one is fine  .  
 yes  i sure can  .  i feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics  .  this machine is working  then  ?  
 yes  this one is in service  .  put your card in here  in this slot and wait a moment  .  then you will see some instructions on the screen  .  
 oh  it wants me to put in my pin number  .  ok  i can do that  .  .  .  
 and press enter to confirm  here  .  now you need to decide which service you need  .  
 there are so many to choose from  .  i did n't know you could do all of this using a card  .  
i hope you can help  .  i 've got a bit of a problem with your atm  .  
 of course  that 's my job  .  oh  dear  .  what 's happened  ?  
 well  it 's eaten my card  !  it wo n't give it back  !  
 i see  .  .  .  calm down  do n't worry  .  may i ask what were you doing when it took your card  ?  
 yes  .  i was only entering my pin  .  i 'm terrible at remembering it  i 'm so forgetful  you see  .  
 mmmm  .  .  .  and exactly how many times did you enter it  please  ?  
 maybe three times  .  as i said  i always forget it  .  
 ah  !  do n't worry  it 's just a security measure  .  if someone uses a card and cannot get the right pin after three attempts  the bank keeps the card in case it 's stolen  .  just contact the bank and we 'll get it back to you  .  
 oh  i see  .  so if i call my branch they can sort everything out for me  ?  
 yes  they 'll be happy to help  .  believe me  it happens to many people  .  
good morning  madam  .  is everything ok  ?  is there something i can assist you with  ?  
 thank you  yes  .  i 'm not sure how to use this atm  i usually go to a clerk and use my bank book  .  but today  i thought i 'd try something new  .  i want to take some money out  .  
 welcome to the electronic age  !  i can run you through it  it 's what i 'm here for  .  
 thanks so much  .  right  i 've put my card in  .  what now  ?  
 just look at the screen here  .  it 'll give you prompts  you see  ?  now you need to enter your pin number  then press enter to confirm it  .  
 then it 'll give me my money  ?  
 not right away  you need to decide what it is you want to do  .  the next thing is to select the service  .  
 here we are withdrawal  so i just press here  ?  
 yes  then enter the amount you want  .  
hello  !  what are you reading about in the newspaper  ?  
 hello  !  i was exhausted form studying  so i decided to read the newspaper to relax  .  unfortunately  the news is so depressing  .  there has been another murder in the city center  .  i  m shocked that the pole 
 people are starting to get frightened by it  .  everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder  .  
 you mean if they catch the murderer  .  i  m scared stiff about going into the city center at night  .  
 there must have been some good news in the newspaper  .  i can  t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited  .  
 well  there was one good piece of news  .  you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease  ?  
 yes  .  her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states  .  
 well  they  ve got the money and she  s going tomorrow for treatment  .  
 i  m so happy for the family  !  they must be very relieved and excited about that  .  
 i  m sure they are  .  oh  and a local man won the lottery  .  i  m so jealous  !  i wish it were me  !  i buy a lottery ticket every week and i  m amazed that i haven  t even won a small prize yet  .  it  s so unfair  !  
how does the political system work in your country  ?  
 we have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament  .  most people call them mp  s  .  
 each mp belongs to a political party  right  ?  
 almost all of them do  .  a few are independent  .  that means that they do not belong to a party  .  if one party more than half of the mp  s  .  they form a government  .  that means that they choose a prime finist 
 what  s a cabinet  ?  
 this is a small group of peopleperhaps  mp  s who are usually ministers  .  they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy  .  
 can any mp make a law  ?  
 any mp can present a law to parliament  .  the proposed law is debated and voted on  .  if it is accepted  it becomes law  .  
 i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties  .  
 yes  it does  because they have most of the mp  s  .  most mp  s vote the way their party wants them to  .  
 how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for  ?

i 'd like to apply for a credit card  .  can you help me with my application  ?  
 i 'd be glad to  .  
 i 'm afraid that i do n't have a credit history  .  i just came to this country  .  
 do you have an account with this bank  ?  
 i 'm afraid not  .  
 in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also  .  that would help with your credit card application  .  
 what is the interest rate on your card  ?  
 the annual charge rate is  .    .  
 that 's very expensive  !  
 not really  .  the credit card is a revolving account  .  you only pay interest on what you owe  .  
 how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges  ?  
 you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized  .  
 does the card provide any other benefits  ?  
hello  may i help you  ?  
 yes  i need some more cash for my visit in china  .  may i cash a traveler  s check here  ?  
 of course  .  we would be happy to cash it for you  .  
 i was going to cash it at the hotel  but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates  .  
 well  any bank will cash it at our present traveler 's check buying rate  for which we  re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge  .  you see  hotels really aren  t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler  s check for their guest  .  
 you mean there is really not that much of a difference  .  
 no  madam  .  not very much  .  
 well  may i cash these three checks for  dollars each  ?  i think that will be enough  .  
 yes  i 'll be happy to cash these for you  .  would you please countersign them here  ?  
good morning  sir  .  can i help you  ?  
 good morning  .  i 'd like to cash this check  .  
 yes  sir  .  can you show you identity  ?  
 what about the driving license  ?  
 do n't you have any other identification  ?  
 i am sorry  .  i only have my driving license with me  .  
 ok  .  would you please sign your name on the back of the check  ?  
 thank you  .  here you are  .  
 how do you want your money  ?  
 would you give me some in twenties and tens  ?  
bill  i 'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the midautumn festival  .  but wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless i pay them an advance of   of the full price  for my business is fairly new  .  i hope that you can make me an advance on loan  .  
 do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security  ?  
 no  .  i should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation  .  you may inspect my accounts  .  from my accounts you can see that i 've promptly met all my obligations  .  
 we do not allow any request for a loan against personal security  .  this is a common regulation  .  but we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor  .  
 yes  i can  .  you know mr  .  macready  the famous car dealer here in new york  .  he agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of us  l   until the end of this year  .  
could i change these pounds for dollars  please  ?  
 do you want small bills or large  ?  
 it does n't matter  .  
 do you want anything else  ?  
excuse me  is this the auto consumer loan center  ?  
 yes  .  is there anything i can do for you  ?  
 could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan  ?  
 the deadline is normally no more than  years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the pbc  .  
 i plan to take the loan for  years  .  
 well  the yearly interest rate is  .   for  years  .  i 'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan  .  
 what about the loan repayment  ?  
 you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank  for example  payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments  .  
 does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest  ?  
 exactly  .  you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank  .  
 that 's very thoughtful of you  .  thank you so much  .  
could you change these for me  please  ?  
 what would you like  ?  
 twenties and some smaller bills  please  .

what separates your product from the competition  ?  
 our product features inventory tracking software  which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a realtime basis  .  
 is the software userfriendly  ?  
 yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a   day employee training seminar  .  
 is this training part of the package or will it cost extra  ?  
what are your terms of payment  ?  
 our terms are net   .  
 what if we purchase an increased quantity  ?  can you give us better terms  ?  
 you would have to order in excess of  units to be eligible  .  
 we do not have the space in our warehouse to store over  units  .  
is this the law firm of a  b  ?  
 yes  sir . how can i help you  ?  
 i need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance  .  
 you would need to speak to ms . stevens  .  
 is she available  ?  
i  m so frustrated  !  
 what  s wrong  jim  ?  
 i called the electronics shop to find out what time they close  and it took me twenty minutes to get what i wanted  !  
 twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are  ?  
 yes . they have some sort of digital receptionist . so when i called in  a machine told me to push a button for the department i wanted to be transferred to  .  
 oh  i hate getting voicemail instead of a person . what did you do  ?  
 i just kept pushing buttons  .  i was transferred to customer service  but there a machine told me to choose between technical help  warranty information  or price information  .  
 couldn  d you choose to be transferred to a real person  ?  
lately i 've felt that company morale is at an alltime low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track  ?  
 you definitely made the right move by calling  .  our primary business is creating  conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours  .  
 it seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team  .  not to mention serious lapses in service  sales and leadership skills  .  
 well as we know nothing comes out of a can  .  we have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company  .  we can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe 
 what a relief  !  i was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again  .  
i understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors . that s what you think  yes  ?  
 yes  .  you could use five or six units . but five or six would n't be very efficient  .  i recommend seven  .  
 and if we take the decker units you suggested  what would the price be  ?  
 let me calculate the price for you  .  i can give you a   discount if you buy the seven units . let s see here  .  your total would be  dollars  .  
 is n't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building  ?  
 as i said  it is possible  but it would be much more expensive  .  i think it would be at least  dollars to do a complete system  .  
 that 's too much  .  we need to use the separate units  i guess  .  
 it 's more practical  and the new units really are very quiet . your customers wo n't even notice them  .  
 so you say we can do it for  dollars  .  
 yes  that 's for the units . installation would probably be another  to  dollars . but it depends on the time spent  of course  .  
 you mean installation is n't included  ?  i 'm very surprised  .  
 no  ma 'am  .  installation is n't included . the price i quoted was just for the units  .  
 in taipei  you know  the company usually installs the things they sell . they do n't charge extra  .  
 i know that  ma 'am  .  but they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs . here in l  .  a  .   installation is charged separately  .  
 yes  i suppose i should get used to it . but i 'm not really willing to spend more than  dollars for this . we have n't even opened yet  .  
 i understand  ma 'am  .  
 and the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for  dollars  .  
 it 's a question of quality  ma 'am  .  at that price  you would not get good equipment  .  i 've been in this business for almost twenty years  .  i know what happens . if you do n't get quality air conditioning now  you will just have to replace the system after two years  .  
 i will tell you what i can agree to . if you can quote me a price of  dollars  installation included  i can accept  .  
 well  .  
 you do seem like a better company than the other one . so i am willing to pay more than  for you  .  but i wo n't pay more than   .  
 well  we do n't usually do it  but  .  .  .  i believe we can accommodate you on this . we will do the installation for free  .  because we appreciate your business  .  
i  d like to open a savings account  .  can you tell me how to do it  ?  
 ok  you have to fill out the form  .  and i let me see three identification cards or documents  .  
 i have the driver  s license  a membership card and my passport  .  would we do  ?  
 let me see them  .  yes  .  there  re ok  .  
 what  s the minimum amount i can deposit in an account  ?  
 you can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars  .  
you wo n't believe what just happened  .  
 what  ?  
 i went down to change some money  right  ?  
 yes  .  we need some  .  how much did you change  ?  
 i wanted to change around  dollars  .  and you know the exchange rate  .  
 yes  it 's about  pesos for every taiwan dollar  right  ?  
 not today  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i went into the bank with my money  and i looked at the exchange board . at first i could n't believe it  .  i thought i was reading the board wrong or something  .  
 why  ?  
 because the board said  pesos for every taiwan dollar  .  
 sixty  ?  that 's too much  .  how can that be  ?  
 i thought it was wrong too  .  it did n't make sense  .  
 just two days ago it was   .  how can it be   ?  
 so  i went up to the teller and started to exchange the money  .  and it 's true . they really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar  .  
i  d like to withdraw some money from my account  .  
 can i see your passbook and with your draft please  ?  
 sure  ?  
 let me just make sure  .  you want to withdraw one thousand dollars  .  
welcome to the company  .  we are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company  .  
 that 's easy  .  it was your office ergonomics that decided me  .  
 you 're kidding  !  something as simple as that  ?  
 yes  .  it is very important to me  .  my mother worked in offices for twenty years  and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome  .  i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries  and i know that t 
 yes  there has been a lot of research into rsi 's  .  something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries  .  tell me  did anything else influence your decision  ?  
 yes  i noticed that you have professional training and teambuilding days  .  i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff  .
