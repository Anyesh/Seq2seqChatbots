exactly . nescafe is the world 's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?
which country makes the best coffee in the world ?
yes . no doubt about that . for us coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people do n't drink that much coffee .
no we do n't especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee .
i suppose so . that 's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in china now .

is that so ?
but do n't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course that 's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
is that right ?

yuan .
here you are .
i 'm sorry . i think we 're out of size .
would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking .
this is supposed to be your vacation we 'd like you to just relax .
cooking makes me feel relaxed . so what are we cooking ?
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
sure . we should probably preheat the oven right away too .
that 's a good idea . can you set the oven to degrees celsius ?
that 's a bit high for lasagne . i 'll just set it at degree and we can take it from there .
fine . i 'll just get out the casserole dish the saucepan the salad bowl and the baking sheet .
you know i could do this myself . why do n't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
i do n't think it 's broken .
well if it 's not broken then you need to learn how to vacuum better because it does n't look like you 've vacuumed for ages !
fine . i 'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
yes there is one on the road .
will you let me know where to get off ?
certainly . it 's just around the corner .
thank you .
take care of yourself .
well thank you very much .
it 's a fortyfive minute to an hour ride .
then what should i do now ?
you 're welcome .
of course . is the dinner still on ?
yes i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
that 's what i thought you would do . listen i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it 's just down the street from all the bars . you probably do n't want to be walking around after dark .
it ca n't be that bad .
i wish it was n't but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings because i 've never noticed anything strange when i 've been at your house in the daytime .
do me a favor and take a taxi . it 'd make me feel a lot better .
ok we will . how do you get around in the evenings ?
when i first moved in i walked everywhere . but within a week i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now i always take public transportation .
has anything else happened to you ?
nothing else has happened to me but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
well we 'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
what happened ?
are you kidding ?
things are tough .
yup .
so what did they have ?
right .
don t mention it .
i have had a heart attack and i want to marry her .
why ?
we appreciate your help .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why did you do that ?
i believe that two people did get hurt .
that 's great . who is the program ?
a boss .
what 's the difference ?
they 're incredibly selfish . they re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
i understand . where to ?
where to ?
ok ! do n't worry about it . i am in a hurry .
would you like some dessert ?
i 'm in a hurry .
that 's fine .
no problem . do n't worry the taxi is faster than the bus .
take your time .
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
i know . but we could get some exercise in and we could get some errands run too . windowshopping won t cost you anything .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
well we could go to the newsagent s to pick up the sunday paper go to the butcher s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner and to the chemist s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
i 'll only go if we can stop at the officelicense to pick up something to drink for tonight .
fine we ll do that on the way home so we don t have to carry it the whole time .
sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though .
i promise . we re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven t had time for .

help you in the kitchen i don t feel like it .
would you like to clear the table then ?
really ? do i have to do it ?
not if you don t want to .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
yes ?
do you have any information about the city sights ?
why not ?
your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
i 'm sorry . what can i do ?
it says no smoking .
sorry i 'm very near sighted .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future .
i know . but things have no choice .
i didn t get accepted .
i 'm not surprised . you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help .
yes i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight .
well why do n't you go on the diet ?
i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class ?
yes maybe i should .
that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet i am still getting fatter .
bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
i know you 're right but what can i do ?
how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
but i 'll miss the news . it s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
i know i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
that 's a good idea !
well i like them very much .
what 's the matter ?
thank you but i am not familiar with it .
i go to the cafeteria .
they 're much better
ok . i ll have them brought for you .
sure mom . do you have time for me ?
yes mr . mason i just checked with our office manager ms . terry she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she could be with your shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
well i swim and run every day .
now tell me what do you eat ?
well i do n't eat any meat but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes and fruit i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well i never drink alcohol coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
you too . have you lost some weight ?
yes i took off kilos . i am glad you notice it .
not some crazy diet fat i hope .
no no i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
sounds reasonable .
oh yes that 's right .
ah yes that 's right .
where is that ?
what about the accounts ?
that s ok .
no thanks . i 've had enough .
actually you have n't have much .
to tell you the truth i am on the diet .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
well i am gaining weight these days and i have to watch my calories .
no do n't try to tend me . i 'm becoming chubby and i have to slender down .
you 'd better not try them on .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight are n't you ?
yes to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers college ?
that 's the one .
what happened ?
yeah . if we share the cab it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well . do n't worry about it i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
are you in a hurry ?
i have to be there before .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's rush hour .

i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .

no . if you ca n't break it keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
here is your receipt . thank you .
yes they all stop at this corner .
i want to go to broadway and nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
you can take any bus except the number .
how often do the buses run ?
they run about every five minutes .
fine . how long does it take to get to nd street ?
about fifteen minutes . it 's not far . are you a stranger in new york ?
yes i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
how do you like new york city ?
i like it very much but it 's a little confusing to me .
you 'll soon get accustomed to it . it 's not difficult . well here 's the bus . fortunately it 's not full .
thank you for the information .
do n't mention it .
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .

number buses run much more frequently do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number bus yesterday and they said i had taken a wrong bus .

yes . go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights turn left there and it 's the first turning on the right .

thank you . i won t miss it .
i m worried about my daughter . she can t decide about college .
don t worry . that s just a part of being a teenager .
i don t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn t affect her decision .
but i just want to give her some tips .
oh she can make her own decisions .
i guess you are right .
believe me . everything will be ok .
i hope so .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i ve changed my mind .
why is that ?
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
maybe you re right .
not bad . there s a new english teacher .
oh what s she like ?
she is beautiful .
is she old or young ?
she is quite young and her hair is blond .
is she strict ?
not really . her eyes are blue .
can she speak chinese ?
not much . she is very tall and slim .

you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn t have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study .
what else i ve got to do ? join the army ?

i want a dozen .
ok i 'll try my best .
in that case i 'll have to take it home .
i 'll be right sir .

lamb and beef . it will get even tastier when we add the veggies !

what ? really ? i don t really want to have to buy a new phone .
well you re in luck ! you see if you sign up for our threeyear plan we ll throw in a handset for free .

there s no catch ! you just choose a plan sign a threeyear contract and that s it ! actually we re running a special promotion right now and we re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .

well you get nine hundred anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other <unk> clients one thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh and we also offer a rollover option .
wow all this for forty dollars per month ?
that s right plus the activation fee the emergency services fee the monthly service fee oh and any charges for extra minutes and . . .

toast dear ?

that 's why i did n't .
i 'm open to work .
yes ! thank goodness you re here . these bugs are driving us crazy !
what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
we just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . we have termites in the wood cockroaches all over the place and last night i saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
well there s nothing we can t handle . i ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and <unk> it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
no problem just get rid of the bugs !
morning michael . i ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run please sit down . coffee ?
no problem i did n't want to burn up at all .
haha i could never do that . i d be a zombie if i didn t have my morning coffee fix . let s get down to business then .
yes . i ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that s great ! i m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no we re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let s get started by drafting a new contract .
sure what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ve got strappy sandals sleek high heels edgy pumps or if you re looking for something a little more practical we ve got mary janes <unk> .
show me some classic high heels please .
ok right this way . what color did you have in mind ?
black . classic .
of course . we ve got this style here that is very popular . because it s an <unk> shoe you can wear it any time of the year . they look great on everyone .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let s look for a closedtoe shoe .
ok these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a twoinch heel so they are very comfortable .
i don t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don t want <unk> . i find slingbacks very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah finally this is what i m looking for .
what size is the design ?
medium please .
here we are . how does it fit ?
hmmm . not good . they re too tight . the length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it s pinching my toes . and there d be no room for my insoles . you know what ? i don t think i have the patience for this today . i ll come back another time .
have a nice day ma am .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ll feed it bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we re planning on having children soon i don t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ll tell you what i can get you some <unk> and we ll take it from there .
yay !
well since we are getting up so late i decided to make a big breakfast !

oh yeah ? tell me then <unk> pants how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well first i need to buy some things such as fertilizer seeds and tools .
what type of tools ?
you know the basics . a rake shovel spade and a <unk> .

i ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
well good luck with your garden especially considering we are in the dry season and it won t rain for the next three months !

i wish i could but i have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !

i m happy to hear that .
i will .
your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .

will you be paying with cash or check ?
that 's good .

thanks a lot . i 'll be there on time .
i m fine . thanks for asking .

oh i see . thanks for your help .
how does friday sound ?
yes .
i am afraid i can t . i have to go now .
i 'm afraid we have n't got any plans .
i am the apartment . how can i help you ?
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
pardon ?
sure . but i 'd like to .
why not ?
ok . i 'll be expecting you .
does that include breakfast ?
i already drove by to check .
i really enjoyed working with you .
should i bring anything with me ?
do n't worry but have you got everything ?
we need to check in .
what is the rent each month ?
not really .
yes i can tell you what we 're looking for .
well off the record of course but i hear that he 's got terrible debts . he has his own company and it 's not going very well .
how much are they ?
why do we need to take a look at it ?
yes i will .
not really !
are you serious ?
don t you try it on ?
i like it but there is one problem .
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
i don t know what you mean .
what 's the problem ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
how much does it cost ?
how much does it cost ?
where s your polling place ?
we have horrible control !
i understand .
say how much would you like to spend ?
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
i need your library card .
i need to return a book .
no i can t .
how about this apartment ?
that will be a problem .
i ll make an appointment right now .
go ahead please .
that would be great .
great . your reservation confirmation number is <unk> . thank you for booking in our hotel . can i help you with anything else today ?
what else can i get for you ?
not really . i like it very much .
i 'm happy to hear that .
not at all .
what is it ?
i reserved a nonsmoking room but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that i can t endure it .
how about this one ?
why do n't you just move in with me ?
you should check the connections .
that 'll be fine .
are you serious ?
thank you .
i m happy to hear you say that .
what are your plans now that you re getting out ?
the ad says plus deposit .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what do you mean ?
i think this is the best price we can offer .
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
what is that ?
a month ?
i 've got one here . it 's a month .
okay mr . horn see you tomorrow at .
i had a home inspection before .
i understand .
can you call the home inspector ?
the leak is a problem with your quality .
the owners might not be aware of that .
i can t think of that .
the owners will not be aware of everything wrong with the house .
that 's good .
i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the secondfloor joist .
maybe next monday .
is that so ?
please fill the tank clean the vegetables and make your skin soft .
i really want to know that .
alright . i suppose we can figure out what you like .
isn t that necessary ?
that will be a good place .
can i do it for me ?
i have no problem with my work .
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i m glad this car is an automatic . i do n't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit please ?
how s that ?
i m working here today .
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition start it up put the car in reserve wait for the road to be clear and then back out of the driveway .
i got it . don t worry . i ll get you there in one piece .
remember no <unk> this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
i 'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan do n't you ?
yeah i know . shop till you drop .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
ahahah and i thought you were tired .
you know . . . i have a weakness for long dresses .
it sure looks special looks expensive too .
sure does . hey can i sponge a little cash of you ?
do n't worry mary i 've got you covered .
thanks jeanine you are a real pal . let 's go in .
eyes you sent them to new york right ?
that 's right . i thought i 'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
give me a short haircut .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i 'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
yes we do . they 're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes i think i 'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
thank you very much .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes it 's my girlfriend 's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we 've got plenty to choose from here .
they look delicious . i think she 'll be pleased .
it 's a good idea .
how old is that ?
i really feel bad about it .
thank you !
wow ! you are such dangerous sports !
i 'm just trying to get up .
that 's because you cheated .
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince me that sara was just a friend .
so what are the washing clothes ?
do you really like such dangerous sports ?
see you later .
i guess we 're in luck .
take the tennis racket . now throw the ball up and hit it with the racket . like this .

oh i forgot about it . i 'll get it .
hey ! what 's the matter ?
this way please .
thanks doctor .
you bet .
good idea .
okay let 's go .
i agree . but i think you 'll have to pay as much as possible .
that 's the only thing i can do .
what 's so great about it ?
it 's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
not to me i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit i <unk> it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me remember ?
just joking t . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
you can buy the bubble wrap here but you ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
that s a good idea . thanks so much .
it takes about minutes per person so it ll probably be about an hour s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do those are less expensive .
no .
ok i will contact you in a week . see you .
and the bubble wrap ?
that s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ve been very helpful .
yes i would like to look at some of your products . i think what i am using now does not fit me well .
why not ?
she usually does n't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . . but i 'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
del is the best choice .
that smells great . i 'll take one bottle please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it 's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder and i do n't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she does n't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would <unk> whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you 've been very helpful thanks .
yeah i 'm glad that we did n't have to wait long .
let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have samosas or <unk> ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well let 's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
i think i might have a dahl .
what 's in a dahl ?
it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
ok shall i flag down the waitress ?
i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round .
you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
sure . how does that sound ?
i want to have a look . would you like to try it on ?
wonderful ! let 's take a look at the price .
what about that one ?
it 's a beautiful brown suit . is there anything else you 'd like ?
if you indeed do n't mind me asking about it i 'm afraid .
oh . i like this one .
thanks . but i m not sure .
but you can take care of yourself if you do like .
i will try the black ones .
sure . here 's the receipt .
i like the design but do n't particularly care for the colour . do you have that in other colours too ?
sure that would be a good idea . how much is it ?
you really like them .
i want some chocolate .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .

do you have any hobbies ?
i do n't know .
what would you like to get for ?

so do you want to go ?
yes it does . do you have anything to declare ?
yes i 'm sure i 've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .

well in that case they must be used for one or two years .
they 're about to .
what else have you got ?
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
what was it ?
about half an hour ago .

yes it seems like my history .

i don t know what most people think are doing . i am also a big fan of people .

that s great . thanks for your help .
thanks a lot .
they are all pretty good .
i spent so much time at home .
thank you .
that 's all right . thank you .
my favorite is to play computer games .
what did you do as your english ?
no i did n't .
i know .
to tell you the truth .
sounds interesting ! how old is it ?
they 're two easy to talk to .
that 's true . he is a good teacher .
yeah . i got sick and tired of her nagging all the time .
you know what you mean .
not at all . he was a hard worker .
well the costumes and the set are marvellous but the acting is a bit stiff . what do you think ?
please do n't be nosey . i 'm sure you will help .
do you think so ?
i just started shopping . how about you ?
for me out of the closet .
i guess i 'm sick .
whoa take it easy . geez you re really going to the doctor .
good luck !
why is that ?
good idea . that sounds like a good idea .
coing out for a walk .
come on . that 's really a good game .
i like playing computer games .
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's not a problem . what is your account number ?
i mean if you don t sell your shares now it s quite likely that you ll end up losing your shirt .
good luck !
but what if something happened to my shoes ?
thanks . which one is the latest ?
well if you have any questions you may ask me .
thanks a lot . i enjoy both .
that 's nice .

nice to meet you lvan . my name is alike . i 'm from japan .
nice to meet you too .
a second language is always difficult .
true but english is harder than most . it s a crazy language .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
i haven t been sleeping well .
thanks for coming !
i took a driver 's course .
so how long did you stay ?
to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher . she is quite young but her class is too boring !
i think so too . i do n't like him either .
she speaks very clearly .
it sounds so good to me .
she is in the hospital with my dad .
i know .
yes . she 's used to be joined at the hip .
you are right .
no she ca n't .
and we 'd like to buy it .
you missed a court appearance .
what are you doing ? you re taking this course again !
i really appreciate your help .
i m going to make sure and get my vote in .
no i did n't .
glad to hear that .
i guess so .
when do you expect to change your mind ?
she was very pretty conservative .
why do you say that ?
i fixed many things .
really ? thanks so much .
it 's ok . if there were anything i can do for you .
i 'll try .
no but she 's so laid back .
right . we have a lot of different things to save up .
of course ! you know what they have .
do you eat any cake ?
not yet . and we get along very well .
ahahah . . . yeah !
i 'm not sure .
twice a year ?
yes reading biographs especially those of wellknown statesmen militarists scientist and artists i can learn a lot from their life histories .
how much are they going to cost ?
why ?
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
i hope so . you see at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher 's speed and accent . i 'm awfully worried i ca n't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
oh she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she does n't mind your making mistakes though .
you know speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .
that 's the new teacher .
what do you think of the teacher ?
she 's very nice .
what does she teach ?
english of course .
is she your teacher ?
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
can she speak chinese to her students ?
not very much .
it 's a good thing you can speak english !
yes i finished last friday .
you sound relieved .
well yes . i do n't mind admitting that i am . i enjoyed school but i did object to having to go in every day once we 've done all our exams .
well what are you going to do now ?
yes i intend to go to university . that ll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
oh yes .
five days a week too ?
actually five and a half . on saturday we have classes only in the morning .
gosh !
that 's too much for us really .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
when do you start school ?
i 'm going to register right now .
that 's good .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
i got it .
do you like it ?
in order to wear uniforms at private school .
are they cheaper ?
oh to a private school .
how many children are there in this country ?
they did n't actually teach in the school .
did you go to a public school or a private school ?
i don t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
can you give us an example ?
i 'll look up the rate . to look up does n't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
that is just a natural grammatical english expression . it has a direct translation in other languages .
this is interesting ms . parker .
i m having a problem .
anything else ?
i sure do .
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .

i park in the daytime .
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?
no i have not seen the signs .

i am completely serious .
you have that much faith in me ?
you 're welcome .
you 're welcome .
yeah .
why ?
i bet it is .
uh huh . . . i think you 're right .
he 's never dated a day .
he 's in front of me .
maybe he is looking for something like that .
what 's it about ?
please sit down on the chair over there .
yes .
it 's so nice of you .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i m pretty good at making curries now but i still need practice at making thai food .
it 's delicious .
well congratulations ! it 's not fair .
it is but after six months .
ok i will .
they do .
yes i did .
it 's really good .
i do n't think much of the film .
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
oh i 'm not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one but it was not the worst one . actually it was n't too bad .
i ca n't think the same .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
i could n't agree with you .
yes ?
i m worried .
never mind . it s all right .
i 've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
what 's the problem ?
no not at all but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
well i wo n't .
i understand .
that 's what i want to say .
pretty good . i ve just had my new poems published .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
he is fine .

i 'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
that 's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
it 's alright .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
i 'd like to send it by airmail .
it sure is .
what about you ?
that means it is cheaper .
yes .
actually it 's not so beautiful .
i 'm sick of it too .
the door bell does n't work the sink is leaking there 's no hot water and the building is falling apart !
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
sure .
how could i feel easy ? i m really pissed .
but you should avoid fingerpointing when you haven t got the real facts .
ok . i ll try my best to calm down first .
oh i am very sorry hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already .
it s all right .
i was caught in the heavy rain or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting .
i was in a comfortable place so really it s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
yes . when i came out of the subway it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
i totally understand .
she didn t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day s hard work .
poor girl !
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
there is a charge on here that i never made .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
no i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them the schools we sent them too and everything else under the sun .
that 's too bad . you know what you 're talking about .
i ended up finding it .
i see .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks doc . i ve got a really bad toothache ! i can t stand it .
i guess you 'd have told me .
that sounds good .
that s right .
i don t want to talk about it .
great . that s no problem .
i hope so .
you 're so industrious .
i know .
forget it .
the world cup ! the first match is today ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa
who are you talking about ?
definitely !
what would you say to him ?
i guess you are right . i would love to see eye with me . how can you prove it ?
i m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can t you try to get used to western food ?
i have tried . but americans like butter bread sugar and cream too much .
i suppose you re right lee . maybe that s why so many westerners are overweight .
it s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs do not take <unk> during the day and yet they can be so heavy .
you see because we are often busy working we eat too much fast food and that food is very fattening .
why don t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy being outside working during the day ?
what do you suggest ? i can t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day or you could get a position that provides training .
really it 's so beautiful .
you like it . well i 'll gather in for you .
you must n't pick it in this place .
where it is ?
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
what is that ?
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
what did you want to get ?
well first of all it is a secret .
he does but his wife is very happy .
i bought it a couple of days ago .
how about sunday ?
yes . here you are .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
why do n't you see the clothes there ?
what kind of books do you like best ?
what do you think about it ?
i 'd love to . what time is it ?
oh don t be angry . i guess you ll just have them sometime .
i see .
yes . i won t lose anything else .
ca n't that be true . what should i do ?
why ?
do n't you think it 's a bit bright ?
how nice !
i do n't know . well my contract here is for one year and i do n't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while .
well have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
actually i am learning that now . but it 's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out .
do n't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
you hit the nail right on the head .
well are you invested in some languageexchange program ?
what is it ?
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
awesome . i 've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ?
how about this sunday ?
ok cool .
good . i 'll give you a call tonight .
no problem .
i am afraid i ca n't finish typing it this afternoon . when will you use it tonight ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
i am not in the mood .
why are you feeling depress ?
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown .
i do n't think she would do such a thing .
but she did and it made me disappointed .
oh cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
but she means a lot to me .
then forgive her mistake .
oh . i just can t forget it .
do you like best ?
what do you mean ?
it 's kind of you to say that .
let 's go to a disco .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
yes i like .
how was it ?
oh dear ! it 's really a pity .
why do n't you have any money for the bus ?
sorry i wo n't do that .
in a private vehicle ?
good for you .
yes . i can assure you .
yeah i saw that program .
which one do you mean ?
and the song is over there .
certainly .
boring ? come on you clutched to my arm all the time .
i 'm glad to hear that .
my advice is to stick with it .
that 's true .
what 's your parents opinion ?
good for me .
what about your spanish ?
we are vegetables on the shelf .
ok . are you sure that this is a little too ?
thanks .
sure . do you have the receipt ?
ok . what would you like for dessert ?
how would you like it ?
i am sorry too . i know we 've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
do n't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
thanks for understanding .
well that 's what being friends is about is n't it ?
hey what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides you and bob have n't seen each other for a while . i do n't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
nah i would n't worry about that . but i do n't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
i know bob wo n't mind . you can bring a date like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .
maybe . . . i 'll think about it .
well last night i had a big argument with ann .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
now that i look back at it it it was n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
that 's pretty harsh .
i know but i was so upset . i mean come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they do n't get to see each other very often .
well in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you should n't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
yeah i 'll call later to patch things up .
that 's very kind of you to say so . let 's try some afterdinner wines .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
do you prefer brandy or ports .
port please .
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in <unk> . am i right ?
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
oh what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
why not ? it sounds great .
ok here 's to your health .
thanks . cheers .
cheers .
sure . let s go .
we are going to visit west lake .
i 'm sorry . i did n't notice that . when did this happen ?
yes .
yes . thanks a lot .
why ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
how many were he now ?
yes and i agree with all his policies .
so he 's got used to that .
i did n't mean to .
you lost the signs ?
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
what 's the problem ?
but he should n't .
what s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes but i bet dollars on the cougars !
looks like you re going to lose out on this game then .
i can t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
what were the odds ?
to in favour of the cougars !
too bad .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
that 's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
yes he was . i 'm not imagining it . finally just when i got home i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did n't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i 'm so scared . can i call the police ?
actually i do n't think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has n't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again then maybe you should call .
why ca n't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
of course you can call the police if you want . that 's not what i mean . i 'm just saying that they probably wo n't do anything .
i suppose . what can they do ? i do n't even know who he is .
listen carol . do n't let this bother you too much . probably it 's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out . if you see him a third time and if he follows you again then i think we should go to the police . but for now just try not to worry .
alright . and i wo n't go to that cafe for awhile .
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
it 's made from naturally frozen grapes .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
that 's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do n't think it 's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
no . worse than that .
can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple ?
let 's see .
ok . i ll take the air then .
we got it . what do you want to see ?
thanks .
where did you go ?
it 's a long trip .
they got engaged .
that 's great . thank you .
have you hurt yourself ?
why did you go so often ?
my boss said i didn t have enough skills to do the job well .
why are you qualified for the position ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
why do you think the cause is a problem ?
you mean the one on the street ?
wow i do n't think so .
you said it .
well . i 've never had that before . is it your birthday ?
the information is scanty for me . and can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
the world cup ! the first match is today ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa
i do n't like it .
it was a nightmare .
come on . give me a chance .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes it s huge .
of course ! i did n't even know that !
do you know what time it is ?
i guess i am .
how old is it ?
then i came back here . i worked for about three years to get some experience .
oh dear . what shall we do ?
yes . thank you for all your help .
yes .
i 'm planning to go to seattle .
what are you going to do now ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
sure . have a nice day .
yes i am .
let me see . how much money do you want to pay ?
how much do you need ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what does he want ?
would you like anything else ?
i 'll do that .
hi steven . what 's up ?
i do n't think we have .
oh i did n't know .
yes but you know him .
how about you ? when are you leaving for <unk> ?
how can i go there to have a taste ?
when you hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
ok i will contact you in a week . see you .
you got me .
now listen ben . look i think it s a very good thing that a young man after he s done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want
yes i can look for my girlfriend .
i am going to try gado .
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
oh i 'd love to .
pretty good sam . only the awful weather you know .
that s right . i ve never really liked it since i got here .
me either but i m dealing with it anyway .
well i ve got some papers due .
really ? so what s the news ?
not too good yet . better than i was though .
i told you i 'd stay up late for dinner tonight .
i have no idea .
i do n't know .
are you sure he 's a phone with him ?
i 'm surprised .
today is thursday .
you ca n't say that again .
i was worried about what the nurse said .
why do you say so ?
my brotherinlaw is having a small gettogether at his house and he invited me .
not really . i like them all .
is this camera a gift ?
yes i used to be joined at the hip .
it was very interesting .
his voice may not be so happy .
how about it ?
sure . it 's one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
i 'd love to but i ca n't remember exactly .
wow you 're so lucky . i saw it on tv . but it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
that 's for sure . you know i had the greatest time ever .
what 's the matter ?
oh speaking of the conductor he is indeed a genius . he did a perfect job . his name is menuhin a descendent of russian american immigrants .
you really got it .
how did you know that ?
i will .
yes i am . what 's wrong ?
why ? what happened ?
he lost his kids college money day trading .
why ?
sure the best price is a place to go .
the national park ?
yes . the scenery there is so breathtaking
really ?
umm per night .
i see .
yes .
i think that too .
do you want to see them ?
i mailed in an absentee ballot .
i 'm afraid we do n't .
after a while <unk> .
good night then .
i got a sandwich and soda .
what about the tires ?
it 's fun .
sure .
thank you .
it 'll be . .
can i do that ?
i told you already ! i m going to get my nails done .
really ? that s a good idea .
it does n't work .
let 's sing it together shall we ?
bye .
what is it ?
really ? i have a good memory .
well since it 's summer and it looks like you 've had quite a bit of sun i 'd recommend our summer special . it 's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
do you have any medicine for airsickness ?
fill in the slip please .
and i 've never tried it before .
i like to paint .
i like playing computer games .
i had a fun time . i guess it 's easier to take care of things at the time .
what 's your opinion ?
i guess so . i 'm not used to watch games .
are you sure ?
i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there 's anything she needs to make it easier ?
it is such a nice place .
sure what would you like to discuss ?
bye .
do n't worry about it . let 's take a look .
leave me alone .
i know . why is that ?
i 'd be glad to . but i 'm not sure if i can pass it .
sure . that 's what i want .
what are they doing now ?
no for the winter .
what did you say ?
come on . i do n't know .
why ? it sounds like a sunny day .
thank you .
it sounds like you do n't have a gun .
that 's a great idea .
he 's too scared .
when does he start shopping ?
we call him and let him know .
thank you very much . that s a good idea .
that was a great addition .
no he did n't . he really liked it .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
i 've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
how can you do that ?
it bears a great many of advantages but also some weak points .
is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
actually it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people not the fetters restricting them .
do n't you have any time for work ?
it 's true .
why did you say that ? you 've always been a <unk> for at least two hours .
i do n't know . do you think it will be ok ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
you 're right .
i 'm glad to help .
yeah . water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
they could generally be divided into two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
well do you have anything to declare ?
yeah . they are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
but what about the indirect ones ?
indirect sources include <unk> that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
i see . for the sake of us all we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
sure . it 's an issue asking for everyone 's participation .
okay let 's call it a day .
tell me what you 're not working hard .
she might be pretty serious about him .
i was just robbed !
yes . and i 'll contact you later .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
what is it ?
i have the abilities qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert for example i have three years experience in designing products and i got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president .
good idea .
we have n't had any problems so far .
that 's great . i can use the internet pretty often .
come on . that 's really convenient .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
that 's really convenient .
that 's true . but how can you tell us more about it ?
yes i think it 's a good idea to go .
i know what you 're going to do now .
i m not sure but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .
how about at the subway entrance .
when did you say ?
well thank you very much .
ok . bye !
no i do n't . i like them very much .
i see . and what would you like to do ?
well i 've never had one before .
but we will have to pay the fine .
that 's really cheap for shoes like those . ok i 'll take pairs .
oh no . that 's true .
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm fine .
lin is a common chinese last name .
i 'm mary .
yes it is . i was looking forward to it .
what position did you receive ?
thank you i 'll get it now .
a korean film called friends starring sang <unk> .
tell me about it .
how did you like the movie ?
i thought it was pretty good .
really ? i ca n't say i agree .
you 're kidding . the story and acting were outstanding .
i ca n't believe it .
i guess it could happen .
is this a long time ?
oh dear . i 'm glad to hear that .
me too .
thank you for your advice .
it 's not that bad .
what time ?
when do you get married ?
well sunday sounds fine . what time ?
doing what ?
sure . what time should i meet you ?
sure . that s fine for me . i 'll see you then .
that 's all right .
hello is that stefan ?
i do n't know .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
oh certainly . at what time ?
really ? i like that .
well what time shall we go ?
oh really ? i got them there .
thank you .
would you mind waiting for my name ?
i 'm sorry but mr . wang is out of order .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
great . thank you .
what is the most important thing to do ?
maybe you are right .
but i like the winter best .
me too . how 's the weather where you are ?
before he made the top three i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that 's a good idea . let 's go !
what kind of food would you like ?
i ca n't wait to see them .
i 've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
yes . very wonderful .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
how big was it ?
no question . he 's coming in bed for an hour .
the ball went through the window and brought it .
for example ?
not yet .
that 's right . hurry up !
where did you get it ?
that s a great idea .
i just got back from the university .
how about taking a walk in the park ?
how do you spend your swimming ?
that 's too bad ! what does it say to him ?
that 's a good idea .
neither . the game ended in two all .
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
but the brazilian is tougher .
what 's he like ?
about . he 's really outgoing . but why do you ask ?
that 's a lot of like me .
i guess you 're right . what else do you think i should be interested in ?
i guess that 's the best way to go for a walk and enjoy the fresh summer .
have you ever tried before ?
i am so sorry to hear that .
what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn t just let them go .
yeah what about these things ?
of course .
is that right ?
sports .
what kind of stamps do you like ?
you like it .
i like taking photos .
do you have any hobbies ?
yes absolutely .
i want to play with you .
that sounds like a good idea .
not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
oh that 's exciting . what 's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well i did n't think so at first . but as we started talking i found his extremely funny and witty . i could n't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams music a
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
there 's nothing definite i think . i do n't have a list or anything but when i first meet somebody i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h
well that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend i would have to say honesty .
i agree . you ca n't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
yeah i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i do n't need fairweather friends either .
i like taking photos .
what kind of books do you like best ?
it 's my favorite . i like dance very much .
how about samba ?
i prefer playing chess .
i guess you are a good learner .
of course . but it 's a very expensive hobby .
to be honest i love dancing .
i like the garden .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
oh it 's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
he did n't say but he said he would call me .
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
oh steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he does n't call ?
come on mary you 're a total catch . i bet he will call you . do n't worry .
thank you steve . you 're always so encouraging .
that 's what friends are for .
thank you li .
ok .
where ?
she is a psycho man .
let me tell you the story . in patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
oh this is unfair .
why !
yes .
i think i 'll sign a deposit for me please .
what for ?
not really . i 'm learning it now .
do you speak english ?
it 's not all that bad . i can t afford to do the job well .
i 'm going to the hospital .
yeah it 's nice but its so red because of air pollution .
good idea . there is plenty of time left here .
good idea . where is the place ?
it 's right .
she is a married man .
i really appreciate this .
i like it very much .
yes i am . what about you ?
not much . i 'm just trying to hook up to the internet . i 'm having a few problems though .
let me look . would you like to have it in your size ?
does she have to do anything else ?
that 's right .
i guess we could try that .
ok go right ahead .
why ?
let 's hurry !
they 're just beautiful .
oh great . let me take your temperature .
let 's go .
i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't you do that ?
that 's how you feel .
i feel the same way .
very good . which ones are they ?
i look forward to seeing you .
oh my god . it 's so nice of you .
what ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
that 's too bad . does he have a defence lawyer ?
he lost his kids college money day trading .
did he tell you ?
see .
we ca n't put up with it any more .
that s right .
don t tell me that .
at least he was looking forward to it .
when do you leave ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
oh .
did he see his face ?
terrible !
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
it must be his fault .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
then he is really lucky .
i feel that i need to buy it .
i do n't know . well he 's a tradition . . . .
hey ! can i do that ?
but i still hate them .
not bad . li hong i m all right as well .
you are so lucky .
yes we 've just married .
do you have a boyfriend ?
i 'm sure he will . oh by the way .
that sounds like a good idea . you know we do n't have anytime to waste .
yes we do .
wow that sounds like a good idea .
i just got back from hawaii .
you got a <unk> on the internet .
i must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
really ? tell me about it .
well it was in the balkans during the war . he was only held for three days and then they simply released him . it was a case of mistaken identity and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . it was lucky they did n't kill him .
you do n't need to worry about that .
yes jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert but still . .
that 's right . is there anything else i could do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
is that all ?
i 'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook .
where did you go to the store ?
thank you very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
how dreadful !
tell me about it .
no . i 'm sure i 'll get it .
my god .
i ca n't find another guy to come .
never mind .
it 's half past seven .
it 's all right .
not about ten years ago .
i 'll make sure and get back to you early .
i can t believe it . i was watching tv .
thank you !
i 'm glad to hear that . thank you very much .
you 're welcome .
yes please .
yes . how about a movie ?
see you .
what 's the matter ?
i see . what about the chicken ?
yes with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl
thanks for your help .
yeah .
it 's fun .
<unk> . tourists .

wow ! what a hit !
yeah he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
is he ok ?
it looks like it he s getting up .
i guess he hit him too hard the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
the giants ?
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
the <unk> s <unk> just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we re losing again .
yeah i just got them . i started playing ice hockey in a community league . so i finally got myself new skates .

the rockets .
really ? i think we play you guys next week . well i have to go to practice . see you later .
all right see you later .
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
how hard is the climb ?
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
what did you do last week ?
we rappelled down the side of a foot cliff . it 's very exciting .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
well you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
yeah i will . see you then !
ok see you .
i 'm just watching some television .
i 'm so bored . i do n't know what i 'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
me too . do you think we are boring people ?
i do n't think we are boring . it 's just that we do n't have any hobbies .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
that all depends on what you like to do . for example i like to doodle on the <unk> so i 'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
i like to play the piano for fun .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hobbies are great . i 'm going to make a list of all the things i like to do .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going to do the same .
awesome we went to australia and new zealand .
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
well . we went bungee jumping when we were in australia .
wow ! isn t that dangerous ?
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
not only is it affordable but it comes with all the appliances .

that sounds like a lot of fun . so what ?
that is not a problem .
great . i 'll tell my friend about it .
not really .
that 's good . when is the party ?
i do n't know .
it 's interesting .
no they do n't .
i 've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
is some traditional chinese food always makes me feel relaxed .
when is your house going to leave ?
i am so happy for them .
what a lot of people think about that ?
it 's a tradition .
sounds interesting !
i 'll live there too .
no . it would be a piece of cake .
great ! i 'd love to join it .
absolutely .
wow ! how many papers does it include ?
i 've heard that .
i 'd be glad to hear that .
ok . so i 'll go hiking and watch it later .
what are you going to do now ?
that 's true . how much do they want to pay ?
what do you think about it ?
that will be a good idea .
yes . i was lucky .

i like it very much .
how would you like your steak ?

i will help you with that .
but as far as you say it 's nothing serious .
yes i think you 'll be about it .

yeah . he 's too scared to ask her .
come on ted ! do n't be such a chicken . if you like her you ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
you 're right .
but that 's better than keeping everything to yourself . you 've got to let her know . come on ! you 've got to take a chance ! even though you are rejected it 's not the end of the world ! there 's nothing to lose is there ?
thank you lisa .

four o 'clock .
thank you .

what a pity !
oh i know what you mean . i like playing basketball .
why not ?
right .
great .
thank you .
i bought it in this afternoon .
i m not sure . please wrap them up for me .
it 's very kind of you .
are you kidding ?
i 'm not disciplined enough i guess .
she is still single .
what about the subjects ?
how do you say it ?
then you must be very careful with her .
just like them ?
oh my god !
what was the most expensive ?
she has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
i 'll be sure about it .
thanks for telling me that .
you 're welcome .
thanks .
yes i am . what 's up ?
i have a friend . he is my best friend and he wants to learn english . he would pay about yuan per hour . are you interested ?
what 's that ?
yes i am .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
well maybe i can go there too .
i honestly have no idea .
all right .
how about at a . m . to p . m .
ok .
thank you .
not at all .
thank you . goodbye .
thank you .
please wait a moment . i 'll be right back .
how much would you like to change ?
excuse me miss . can you use my cellular phone during this time ?
goodbye .
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
i 'm starving so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?
i 'm not really in the mood for italian actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
if you want spicy food then i 'd recommend going to a thai indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
i really like that restaurant you get a lot for your money there . but they 've westernized their food so it 's not actually that spicy .
you 're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
the taj ? they 're a bit expensive but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
the taj it is then .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
they 'll still charge us a corkage fee .
that 's right . it 'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
do n't worry about money . i 'll treat you tonight .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
no i 'll pay . it 's my turn anyway . you paid last time .
i wo n't argue with that ! let 's go !
have fun .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars .
i 'll take the bus .
thank you very much doctor .
i have n't eaten anything in the bank .
thanks ! these are beautiful . you should n't have !
thank you . same to you .
not yet . i ve been working too hard lately .
i 'm sure you can pass the exam .
hi ! the same to you !
thank you .
you are welcome . glad to come again .
i just got back from london .
i bet you had a wonderful time .
great . i got to try so many things for the first time .
no i traveled for the three years .
do n't tell me you have been working too hard .
it s too old . and it isn t as specious as i expected .
what s he like ?
about . he 's really outgoing . but why do you ask ?
i missed it .
speaking .
that 's great . congratulations .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
he prefers suits to jackets .
judge from his look he 's a very serious person .
as a matter of fact he is .
do n't believe him . he 's a liar .
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
they have moved to chicago .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
i 've already done a month .
really ? that 's really something else .
i 'm not sure .
and how about that ?
very good . but what are the terms of time ?
really ? that 's great .
fine . i 'll have a try .
i was thinking about it .
how long is the tour ?
i 'm not sure where it is .
how long will it take to get there ?
what 's the problem ?
sounds good .
where are you planning to travel ?
i see .
you too . i just wanted to get married .
sure i have . i liked it very much .
it 's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective .
what 's the weather about ?
good afternoon ! sit down please . how are you ?
i 'm very well thank you . how are you ?
very well too thank you very much . isn t it a lovely day ?
yes it 's beautiful but it 's also very hot .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
mm . . . it 's quite warm now .
where do you live ?
i live in the haitian district .
here . near this school .
i 'm fine thank you . how about you ?
oh i 'm really busy . how are you ?
say when .
good to see you too !
i like spring .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
i like spring too . we can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
my boss said i didn t have enough skills to do the job well .
can you work parttime or fulltime ?
ok . let 's go .
what do you mean ?
i was thinking about it .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
how about summer ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
i think we should do something different today .
i really hate this weather .
cool fellow what 's the date today buddy ?
it 's . . . oh it 's the st april april april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it did n't you ?
on th may .
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
th day of the fourth month .
by the way could you tell me when the film will begin ?
it will begin at five thirty .
how many people is there in the morning ?
have a seat please .
i do n't want to miss it today .
it was a nightmare .
what was the score ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
yes it 's really wonderful .
no . i did n't notice that .
has it been rush hour ?
well i guess i was nothing but then i guess . we could do that .
how many members were there in europe ?
yes . thank you for all your help .
me too . recently i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
for me the times of chatting online has gone .
i 'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
oh you are so lucky !
i won t let you go .
of course . let 's sing it together .
when did you start worrying about your weight ?
crazy !
what 's its name ?
ha !
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huan huan .
who 's that ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh i see . if i buy more than a set can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things such as postcards key chains posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i ca n't wait to see what they have .
i m pretty tired .
which is that ?
not really . but i like spring and fall .
i ca n't believe it . where are you from ?
there are actually seats in the sea . you can get them as soon as you want .
yes but we could get stuck in the traffic jam .
.
i like them but i do n't think much of them .
so why ?
no but that 's right .
i have n't heard of them . how much is it ?
how about a story then ?
no this is the first time i 've been here .
oh really ?
yes they are .
how come ?
no i think so .
no i have n't .
oh what a pity !
it was great .
yes i m fine .
what about the money ?
no way !
i think i caught a cold .
i am so sorry .
i didn t know .
what ?
what 's the matter ?
what was the score ?
here you are sir .
you are a lucky man .
is that so ?
how long have you been married ?
yeah it was nice to meet you too .
what s up ?
have you had a cold ?
do i have any symptoms ?
how come ?
ok . i ll do something .
joe ? i do n't know what you mean .
i remember you are in love .
oh i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
it 's greek to me .
so the reform can not be carried out well .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
easier said than done .
he is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
what ? it s only p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
oh i see .
i 'm tired of your <unk> opinions . who do you think you are !
how dare you speak to me like this .
why not ?
i 'm sorry .
do you know this is a onaway street ?
you are so thoughtful .
i feel the same way .
i wish it was a nicer day today .
it sure is . he has no one to turn to very miserable indeed .
have n't you heard that he is in prison ?
what ? beg your pardon .
john is in prison now . he was copped <unk> .
i just can n't believe my ears !
i ca n't deny that . she is so beautiful that i fell in love with her at the first sight . i wish i knew more about her .
but i heard that she had a threeyearold girl .
i can not belive that . it must be cooked up by someone .
of course i wo n't chill out . opportunity knocks only once .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you 're right . i will have a talk to her about that .
really ? i thought he loved his wife very much .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
he deserved it .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
yeah .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .

that 's good .
i 'd love to .

how about make up ?
i am sorry to hear that .
i don t know that . you re crazy !
that s great . is there anything i can do ?
anything else ?
he 's pretty tame . he must be used to being around lots of different people .

yes it looks interesting .
you 're right . i love it very much .
it must be old .
at least more than years old .
let 's enter it !
i ca n't open the door .
it must be locked .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
she ca n't answer you .
she must be deaf .
it must be a haunted house . are you frightened ?
frightened ? you must be joking .
yes i do .
i think she s going to take a long time .

a glass of white wine would be fine thank you .

hello jack . it 's mary . what are you doing in your office ?
i ve been working .
are you doing anything tomorrow ?
tomorrow ? no i 'm afraid i would n't be able to . i 'm going out of the town on business .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we may have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
sorry i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
will you come round next tuesday ?
next tuesday ? just a moment ! it will be the st of may . oh dear . arm . . i promised my aunt i would be at her birthday party .
that s very good you !
let me see . yes mary . let 's make it next wednesday .
ok . bye .
bye .
i 'm glad i could help .
thank you .
how did you like it ?
okay .
i ll be glad to help . what do you think of it ?
i went to yale university .
did you ? and what did you study ?
i have a b . a . in economics .
would you mind telling me how old you are ?
i 'm twentyseven .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
yes i have worked in a bank for the last five years .
and what is your salary at the bank ?
i got a week .
thank you . good evening mr . dean .
would you tell us your name please ?
i 'm helen baker .
glad to meet you ms . baker .
glad to meet you too .
where are you from ms . baker ?
i 'm from new zealand .
what do you do for a living ?
i manage one of the ski lodges . it s a great job i can spend a lot of my time outdoors and i also get to ski for free all season .
what do you teach ?
what s the problem ?
here is your key . your room is . you can find the elevators just around that corner there down the hall . enjoy your stay ma 'am .
yeah i 'd like to .
yes i do .
will you please fill out the form ?
well that s all right . let s move in .
thank you . can i cancel my reservation ?
what about some other time ?
tomorrow evening ?
that s all right . good for you .
as soon as you can .
thank you for your time . anything else ?
no i have n't but i 've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
what kind of job are you looking for ?
i 'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field .
you have n't had any experience in either of those fields .
i know . but i 'd like to try . look here are some advertisements that i 've cut out .
i was turned down again . it s frustrating . i guess you ve got to teach me some skills .
me ? i m even less experienced than you are .
at least you know what american women generally like in a man .
believe it or not i guess american women like a man in good shape which chinese women may not care about so much . that s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise there aren t many chances .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is <unk> chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
you know that s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
why don t you try then ? even if it doesn t help you find an american girl you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won t lose anything by doing that .
hi don . what a surprise !
yeah i saw someone walking like you but i wasn t sure . we haven t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
have you noticed what has changed ?
oh you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
yes . i m on a diet but i ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ve lost twelve pounds .
wow ! that s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals but it s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know old habits are hard to break .
what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that s not hard . i can do that .
sure . join my class next week .
it does n't matter . . .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
what s wrong with that ?
i see .
why ?
why do you say ?
really ? are you going to continue to get a job ?
used to . when did you play it in a fierce game ?
exactly .
oh ca n't you give me a hand ?
how do you know what you mean ?
no . what are you going to do now ?
that 's a good idea . you can go to the bank and see if i can help .
why ?
do you want to study english ?
i 'm sorry but i do n't know how to go .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you understand . take it easy .
do you believe it ?
it is . things are easier to take public transportation .
c 'mon . you 'll have to give me another guy .
why not ?
what 's that ?
no you wo n't .
what about these things ?
nothing really .
coming .
sounds like fun . where did she come ?
really ? that 's all right .
of course . i would love to catch the chinese dishes when i was a little child .
i 'm looking forward to it .
what do you mean ?
i guess i could take a long time .
yes . that is the latest product .
i like that .
i did n't know that .
well i grew up in africa so i learned a few different languages .
you 'll cook it of course !
so what are you going to do ?
not really .
yes it 's going to be fun .
where can we meet now ?

thank you very much .
it 's kind of you ! what is it ?
no i did n't know that .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
well i was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! can you believe that ?
it 's important to tell you the truth .
yes . i have also decided to buy some souvenirs .
the maximum is rib .
it sounds like fun . he was planning to have a throw in the net .
me too .
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards in the east they would even read tea leaves !
well it 's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . so unfortunately you 'll lose this rib . we 'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
well historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards in the east they would even read tea leaves !
absolutely .
yes i 've been working in this company for two years .
alright . but will we sing ?
my boss said i didn t have enough skills to do the job well .
what are they ?
of course i do . i 'll be working on it .
what 's the difference ?
i guess i 'm right .
a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play !
well that sounds like a good idea . maybe i should invite him to a movie .
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
glad to meet you .
nice to see you too .
thank you very much . i nearly had a very good time .
what ? you don t like the house then ?
thanks for helping me .
why ? dad !
you can put it on your radio too .
oh really ? where is it ?
so did you ?
it 's a oneyear lease .
and how about your spanish ?
that would be a good idea .
yeah but that is not a good idea . i like that .
yes it 's one bedroom and a living room .
what was the room rate ?
how s it going to be ?
we have no idea where the whole house is .
have you got it ?
when will you give me a raise ?
do you really think so ?
yeah you have some other ideas ?
i think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
oh i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
i think so . maybe he 's fallen for her .
yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
i like the food .
well you didn t have to . . .
i bet you could work out better .
sure i get it .
have you ever tried the ads ?
what should i do then ?
sorry i can t .
so what are you going to do ?
i 'm still hungry .
what about the one after the job ?
perfect !
i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ?
when do you plan to visit him ?
what makes you say that ?
yes .
that 's fate .
i feel sorry for her .
maybe this is god 's will .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
well i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?
hey i play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . it 's good to know .
yes it is .
we provide uptodate training on state of the art equipment .
excellent . we will have to discuss the details with you .
well we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan .
what else ?
since everyone is different your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you 'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ?
it 's free of charge . with one pound .
perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first .
absolutely !
yes i like collecting things .
oh that s interesting and but what kind of things ?
several things for example various coins stamps stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes stones .
well i can t just image it .
not bad . thank you for asking .
thank you . see you later .
i do n't believe you 're right .
what 's the reason ?
i know .
she 's got a award .
so have you been on the bus very long ?
fine thank you .
i will mom .
boy you 've got such a crush on her have n't you ?
okay . let 's move on .
you said it .
i like football .
when ?
i 'm not crazy about it .
really ? you 're kidding ! why ?
bingo !
it 's hard to say . i like spring and fall .
romantic ? what 's that ?
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
thank you for your invitation .
ha ! i 'm surprised to hear that . i thought you loved them .
maybe . let me think about them .
that 's great .
oh it was terrific . i spent lots of time at home .
nowadays you must be a dj .
yes .
because i loved it .
i know .
of course you 're right . but you know hard .
i have no idea .
what about class ?
of course !
i hope so .
i want to study english literature .
thank you for your compliment .
you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
fine . by the way can you speak english ?
what else do i need to know ?
ok .
what 's the actual score of the game ?
do n't worry .
sure . but you know that i ca n't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
they are puzzles . it 's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the lantern festival .
it 's interesting and i want to buy one home .
it 's amazing .
come on ! tell me about it .
not sure . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look .
really ? i 'll take it .
i like chinese food . is there any difference ?
you 're telling me .
i guess you 're right . thank you for your help .
yes a lot of children are learning in the evenings .
how can i do that ?
what 's your problem ?
that 's good idea .
it 's cheaper is n't it ?
here it is .
that 's a good point .
good idea .
how about your experience ?
i can take it from you .
the food there is actually a good .
i see . what 's the problem ?
you know that they do a good job .
thank you .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
that s definitely true .
i ca n't see it .
you like the food there ?
i do n't like milk .
do they hear a good job ?
yes i do .
that s great news . i can t agree with you more .
yeah they are june now .
no you can find it one .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
what are there ?
not really .
that 's good ! do you know at all ?
yes . what else can i do for you ?
i know but we have n't done that .
your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
that 's a good idea . thanks a lot .
yes . i think that 's what i want to do .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
that 's a good idea .
well what 's the problem ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
i like all sorts of movies primarily drama and science fiction .
well income taxes were on tv .
oh i see . well we can t wait to see them .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
mmmm . . . what 's your favorite movie ?
really ?
can you swim now ?
bill and betty have already grown up .
sorry mom .
look at that big tree over there .
yeah oh my god ! it s still there . we have our first date right on there .
oh i know that i fell in love with you at the first sight then .
you seemed to be dull at that time .
but you agreed to go out with me at last .
smile i can t believe this for it s been years since we got married .
what about that one ?
yes but i am not sure . i ca n't believe it .
why not ?
what 's that about ?
oh ! i see .
what other kind of food do you like ?
i m really sorry . i thought he was going to win for his films .
great . no problem .
that 's true .
the <unk> market is final at the end of the year . it 's a very powerful product .
why not ? i do n't like her .
a movie ? what 's on tonight ?
there 's a sitcom .
ok . here s the plan .
it was the best day when you came home .
but she was not a very fine <unk> friend to cheer you .
i am glad to hear that .
yeah !
it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film the departed did n't you ?
old is n't it ?
who won ?
absolutely .
i like it very much .
there s so much i want to do . i ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
thanks . that would be very helpful . i ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there s too much information on the net .
when you sent your emails did you attach any files to them ?
yes i did . there s an antivirus programme with my email account that scans all <unk> so i m sure i haven t sent anything nasty to anyone .
when you use the internet be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do you might get a lot of spamunwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
that s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself such as my password and credit car number .
that s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
how do i do that ?
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it you will
that s useful to know . thanks . i ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
really ? i m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star s private live in recent years .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
i wouldn t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
<unk> really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you <unk> on a chat show and said something silly it
thanks a lot . i ll do my best .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
i love children as you know so probably a children s charity .
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first book
thanks a lot .
yes it is . thanks . i m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i m here . of course i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about or places that offer it in this city .
so what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone anywhere at a
it s wonderful isn t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
yes i do . i also use an <unk> program and a firewall . there are so many <unk> on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
how often do you run your antivirus program ?
i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time .
which antivirus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several <unk> the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program you
computers are great aren t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i use it almost every day but i usually only use it to check my email . i don t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot don t you ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
so you re online eight hours a day .
yes i like the job though . sometimes i help other people in the office if they re having trouble online .
how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
i think it s fairly useful but there are two big problems . first a lot of the information you find online is false . second when you buy something online you don t see it until you actually get it .
how do you solve the website problems when you re buying something online ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
i d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources they try to steal them by military force .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
would you like to live in the country ? i m not sure i d like it .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i see what you mean . i love being far away from city but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
people can t have it both ways . if you live in the country it is often less convenient . if you live in a city it is noisy buy there s more to do .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they re so much better to look at than concrete rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
just remember that in that village there s nothing to do . there s not even a pub or restaurant . there s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
you re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
it 's true .
thank you .
i was telling you about the time .
wait a minute please . we are not too worried about these .
interesting . maybe that makes sense .
iris . that s what i asked for .
like for example if i hadn t studied architecture i would have become an artist like i wanted to .
how many years does it take ?
why not ! it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels .
but it s so old .
don t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it s about ?
no not at all .
first of all it s a romance novel set in the early th century .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
why does he want to do that ?
since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way all of his daughters will be cared for .
won t they get his <unk> ?
no that s the problem . though they are welloff once he dies his house will go to his cousin . so when he dies the girls will have nothing .
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn t so horrible after all .
so are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
there s movie ? my teacher didn t tell me that !
that s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
it would take a lot less time . .
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
ok . that sounds like a deal .
i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch remember to have something else for them to do . if you don t they ll get bored and misbehave .
they could go out and play with their friends .
sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
that s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv the kids will probably follow suit .
i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don t like traveling to work waiting for buses or . . .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
exactly .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thorn birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends .
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months .
how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
is it really worth paying for ?
i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter .
if it 's any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
not a great deal .
i 've just been reading an article about them . they ll be used for all sorts of things now .
for accounting system and things like that you mean ?
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
do you have any information about the city sights ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
that 's right .
do you have anything to declare ?
wait a minute .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
yes maybe they are right .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
oh what s he like ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
um that s good .
yes but he s got a wife and children as well .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself today .
what happened ? you look so pale .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't see anything wrong with what we 're doing ! that 's just the problem . in these kind of things the trouble does n't always appear at first .
oh that 's too bad . work harder next term .
b i 'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
do n't lose heart . everything will be fine .
are you sure ?
yes of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
i m glad you re enjoying it .
thank you for the invitation .
it s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
yes please . thank you for everything .
sorry i can t .
tomorrow night then ?
i d like to . but i m afraid i can t .
i m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that s sounds great .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
i m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are <unk> ?
it s a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april th so i m an aries . when were you born ?
january th .
let s see . . . you re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work but you could see new exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ll both have interesting summers !
that s bogus . i do n't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
no it s not your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
well you certainly match those criteria but they re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
a capricorn is <unk> and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
ok !
what is the fare ?
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a <unk> nose sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh he is also bald !
your future husband !
not funny .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
mumm . no .
it s only the day when the world s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
what ?
the world cup ! the first match is today ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa
i have no idea what you re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each g
sounds interesting but soccer doesn t really appeal to me .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team hoping they will <unk>
all i know about soccer is that you can t use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick .
whatever i m going to go watch the opening match .
mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from the finals .
well i think you re pretty lucky actually .
i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
don t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be <unk> grateful . i bet you it will even <unk> mine with all that practice .
i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese .
well there is that yes .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
ok kids here sa beach ball and a frisbee a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
you re back already ? the water was too cold huh ? i ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
what is that ? a jellyfish ? !
ah ! not on me ! ow !
i want to think of it for some time .
um i did n't know anything about it .
what are you talking about ?
why did n't we have to ?
she is a teacher .
thanks honey !
yes . four hundred and fifty .
how many people are there in your party ?
yes it does look a bit sore . let s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
you re in luck !
oh while we 're on the subject what happened to you and your secretary ?
i think we re awesome !
sure .
but it s the same with the shirts we have . i can t stand it anymore .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax !
let s have a look . what are we having ?
okay i ll show you how .
i m very sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad you like it .
that sounds like it !
fine !
oh that would be great . give me a break !
it 's so crowded that it is here . i 'll take this one .
you mean i am going to think about it !
that 's terrible .
of course ! when are you coming ?
i see what you mean .
whatever !
what happened ?
my boss said i didn t have enough skills to do the job well .
ben we re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?
oh just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
uhhuh .
then walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ?
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you got it ! i have a new job i m living in a new city with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ?
well first of all i ve decided to stop smoking . it s not that i m pinching pennies or anything it s just that i ve been smoking since i was sixteen and i think it s time to stop .
i m with you on that one . anything else you re planning on doing ?
one last thing i ve decided to come out of the closet .
it s about time !
cheers !
i will try my best .
what s he like ?
how about the shop ?
are you going to have to give me a try ?
hmm . . . no problem .
come on ! give me another chance .
yes that 's easy . but can you give me a message ?
one goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please .
so you also like coffee ?
i 'm going to divorce .

that sounds good .
no she didn t .
how can it cost you ?

i think that 's a good idea . maybe they can teach you how to surf the net .
george how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don t have much money left after paying the rent .
well lili we can visit different places in the state in our van . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me it won t cost much .
where will we sleep then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let s see . gas food recreation we won t spend much . come on . don t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard haven t we ?
maybe you re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can t wait !
oh i don t know where we re going yet .
as long as we re going you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let s go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
ok . let s get a shopping cart .
i found the ideal position . i m working for a plumbing company .
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years and now you have a job working with your hands !
plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge and creativity . i love this job .
i can see that . but i didn t know you had experience in that line of work .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude my application was accepted .
congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
did you have anything to declare ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
so what s up ?
probably .
i have been watching tv .
it seems that you need to learn something like that .
i m fine . and you ?
i like playing basketball .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
well i used to work at least twice a year .
you 're getting used to sleep ?
i know .
what s your opinion ?
palmistry ? what is that ?
it 's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
oh you mean palm reading . i 've seen that before but i do n't believe in it .
are you sure ? i 've read a lot about palmistry and i 've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
really ? you 've read books about it ? ok then . but only if you want to .
ok let 's see well you 've got a long life line which is good and the love line is strong . . .
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
hmm hard to say wait yes it looks like you will do well in business and your ambition will help you a lot but . . .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
you are such a good talker .
no not really . why do you ask ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
you saw a ghost ? when ?
it was many years ago when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs when . . .
so that 's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
it was a big green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen and it slowly moved towards the stairs . . .
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ?
it moved slowly up the stairs step by step and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
that 's what i thought . it seems that he 's been seeing someone else for about two months .
two months ? how did you find out ?
i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister and i said no i was his wife . she hung up immediately .
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
yeah he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse and so i pressed him on it .
what 'd he do ?
he kept trying to make stupid excuses and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
that s great . where should we pay him ?
that depends .
you are serious ?
i think that it s just about me .
i 'm glad you came .
i know what you mean .
oh come on ! that s not a bad idea . how often do you exercise ?
do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
that s a good hobby .
how many years do you have ?
not at all . but we should learn more about it .
yes . i d like to have a good rest but not satisfactory .
thank you for your advice .
nothing really .
i do n't know . it sounds like an <unk> .
good idea .
it is one thousand yuan .
thank you .
well you 're ready to go to the store and buy some medicine .
i 'm sorry for hero .
i do n't understand . we ca n't be talking about it .
how do you pay for it ?
i 'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
tell me if you need help .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian .
that s fine with me . i don t hate vegetables and i don t eat much during lunch .
well then the cafeteria suits you best . but anyway if you like to have a lunch outside the company feel free to join me anytime .
i 'm going to graduate this summer .
where are you going to work then in australia or back in china ?
i 'm planning to return to china after graduation .
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
well i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .
yeah china 's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
of course ! it is the no . stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress both we and the companies should do something . for me i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don t think we can change our working condition . anyway we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them like avoiding <unk> deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
no . he did n't tell you why . how did you know that ?
have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among him ?
they had no reason for arresting me .
that 's cool . but how do you feel when you quit ?
what else can i do for you ?
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
yes next march .
you were playing it .
you must have been <unk> .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
good night . . .
good idea !
good idea .
your usual shirt and shoes .
it fits me perfectly .
i know .
i like the design but do n't particularly care for the colour . do you have that in other colours too ?
it 's ok .
so what were you calling me about ?
do n't mention it .
i 'm serious .
all right . next time you will treat .
i agree with you .
thank you for your compliment .
but i still ca n't believe it .
good .
yes but i still love being .
i see .
follow me into the kitchen . you will love it .
hmm . . . that 's what i need to do .
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda .
that 's great . thanks for the rest .
i had my first cigarette when i was .
yes that 's nice . thanks .
i 'll have the lamb chops welldone please .
i could call her later .
supervisor . open the door .
it must be locked .
sorry mum i 'll lock it right away .
all right . it is no problem .
did you have a good breakfast ?
good idea .
i would n't mind a burger .
i 'm fine .
that 's not a good idea . let 's go and have a look .
oh i do n't know !
yeah and it 's so huge .
but you just did n't . . .
no . i saw her dating with her .
no he won t .
i thought that he was good at the high jump .
i agree with you .
that 's a good idea .
dad i have to do the homework .
sure . i have a promise .
what application materials should i take ?
oh i forgot about it . i 'll get it .
i think you are right .
i went to harvard university .
i like spring .
i prefer summer especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for icecream .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
well i have to hide in the airconditioned rooms . anyway it is all worth just think about the cool evening time .
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
how did that happen ?
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
oh that sounds great !
that 's all right .
maybe i should try to quit smoking .
yeah .
well he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
china .
what was the score ?
china beat brazil to .
wonderful !
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages . how 've you been ?
fine just fine . and you ?
not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ?
i went back to visit an uncle in beijing .
better take the subway . it s faster and more convenient .
en where do we pay the fares ?
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he 'll give you a ticket .
oh i see . by the way how can i get online ?
cash credit card or debit card ?
just two blocks down there .
what else do i need to know ?
no you do n't have to .
is that so ? i did n't know it . can i possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i am sorry you ca n't borrow a jacket and a tie .
then we 'll return to the hotel and come back will you change the appointment ?
certainly what time will you come back ?
at please .
ok great should i bring anything ?
a party of .
alright we are waiting for you at .
er . . . hum . . . got it .
then open that window . yeah that one .
right !
and that 's it . you 're done .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
no please feel free .
oh is it ?
you 're welcome .
thanks a lot . i m so sorry .
i just lost my job . my boss just told me .
that 's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
i do n't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money .
i cant't believe it . you 've worked here for years .
i hope so .
come over and visit when you have time .
ok . i 'll call you saturday .
ok . let s go .
well what ?
i 'm glad that you thought about it .
i just don t want to play table tennis any more .
emm . . . yes . but i was n't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up .
you are kidding but she 's so helpful .
tom . . . you are her boss you down . of course she 's helpful to you .
come on . she 's like that with everyone .
i do n't think so actually . she never even says hello to me .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh the whole house needs repainting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out and i 'd like to put in new walltowall carpeting . last week i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway all par for the course when you own a house i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
well i think a crystal <unk> would look great in your living room and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
wow you really do have a talent for this alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome jack . glad to be of help .
yes i did .
are you serious ?
it was scary .
sometimes they are just as affectionate as dogs .
hello is that stefan ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
yes i did . have you lived here long ?
me ? i guess so . i 've lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ?
no not really . when i left vietnam i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work alice ?
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
i am an accountant at a company .
well tom . it 's good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening and i need to get to the college .
it 's nice meeting you too alice .
see you around !
goodbye alice .
thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure meeting you as well the flowers are for you .
thank you they are beautiful .
you 're right .
first let 's try it again .
what ?
so you 've got it .
really ? are you sure you will be all right ?
i see .
the note might be that you have seen . . .
here you are .
i 'd like that .
then how about dinner or something to eat ?
that 's right .
i did n't sleep a wink last night .
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .
well i 'm under a lot of pressure . my boss is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near and i still have n't finish one of them .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes thank you . i am really far behind on this project . could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
nothing .
should i fill it out ?
a little but not much .
take care of yourself .
i was there for about three years .
why are they all right ?
sure it is .
well suffer then . if you have a toothache you have to go to the dentist .
no . we have n't .
yeah the government really takes a bite doesn t it ?
it sure is .
yeah i guess you 're right .
yeah . it won t be much but at least we ll have a monthly check when we get old .
i was looking forward to meeting with you .
let s just hope the politicians don t figure out a way to spend it .
really ? i would have liked them .
that was an odd change of subject .
really ? who won ?
i liked them too .
not at all . go ahead .
ok . does your present employer know that you are going to leave ?
laura .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
i don t think it s very nice . and my father doesn t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how often ?
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
who s that ?
it s my mother . she s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
do you like swimming ?
yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports indoors or outdoors .
oh i see . i like it very much .
it 's really a place to work .
sure let me take a look .
that 's great . why did you ask me ?
me too .
that 's great . thanks for your help .
we ll be there .
that s good . you ll feel better after you do .
that s all right .
don t you think you re proficient in both written and spoken english ?
charge please .
that 's good .
i 'd like a cup of coffee .
would you like some ice cream ?
peas and carrots .
any more ?
no not at all .
you 'll have to pay duty on this .
here you are .
where shall we sit ?
i prefer the outside one .
great thanks .
driver can you please speed up ? i m afraid i might miss the flight .
what about this family ?
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
thank you .
i grow a variety of things so that something is in bloom all year round .
when is your garden at its best ?
it looks best in spring when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
i m planning to go to the travel agent .
well what time do you want to go to bed ?
to the beach
you want to go to paris ?
medicine . i suppose that 's what i want to have .
i was a member of the basketball club .
if you want to go there please .
one way trip please .
my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
yes i have . but i have to wait .
but i still think about it .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
me too .
ok .
we 're stranded here tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
well i still wonder if you could come down with me tomorrow .
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain .
that does n't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we 're supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i do n't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you 're lucky it 'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens then i 'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
do you think you can come ?
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
not really . what s up ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
how old is he today ?
it 's his th birthday .
well wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well if you can wait until tomorrow night i 'll go with you then .
sorry i 've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just is n't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
sure . hey i 'm sorry but i 've got to get going .
yeah me too . it 's about time i made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . see you later .
bye !
it 's beethoven . do you like it ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent too . do you believe that ?
i do n't know about that but i do think that it helps people relax .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
actually i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
to be honest i think classical music is too complicated for me .
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
i like pop music . do you ?
not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth .
i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much .
how long have you been in to pop music then ?
i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
not really . when i was little we did n't really listen to music at all .
so how did you become interested in it ?
well when i was about years old i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started .
do you still play piano ?
yes it 's one of my hobbies .
what kind of movie is it ? i don t like many of his movies actually .
it s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
i like thrillers and i like julia roberts so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn t seem to be very impressed .
what did the critic say ?
he didn t say it was bad but he said that it wasn t as good as it could have been particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
good . dinner is nearly ready and i d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results .
i won t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
i like variety shows .
i like those kinds of programs too . they re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . and that s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
right . you can t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .
i think there s a problem with the advertisements .
that s great idea . but don t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
no . they don t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each month .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country but people don t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
well there s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there s very little evidence . it s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes but i hope audience won t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
did you enjoy making the movie ?
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ve made recently . does that bother you ?
not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think .
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
thank you very much for doing this interview .
my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ?
yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you i was very impressed with rachel s performance in the movie . she s going to be a star .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
yes i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i do n't remember but it was n't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ?
no but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
where are you from ?
i 'm from shanghai . and you ?
did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
most of the time we were lucky but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
wow that must have really been scary .
actually some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
where do you exercise ?
no but my father 's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
that sure did n't last long !
i 'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
what happened to him ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
was it his first offence ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .
what happened to him then ?
not much it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of .
did they take his license away ?
no they were really easy on him . the problem is that that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
what do you think will happen to him ?
well he 'll definitely lose his license pay a fine and maybe even spend some time in jail .
that does n't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
not yet . if we ca n't find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one .
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
that 'd be great ! i know he 'd appreciate your help .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
how would you solve the problem ?
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
it would probably be very expensive .
i think the government can afford it . besides there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
it s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
if we are to invest more money to education we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn t be popular with voters .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things but without increasing taxes .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
not bad .
i 'm afraid not .
i think they 're ok .
. yuan .
i would like to buy one .
i know . and i want to beyond my control .
yes i have all the prices here .
i already knew .
three percent ?
yes they do . is there anything else i can do for you ?
i think they 'd better pay for it .
are you nuts ? how much do they cost ?
it is because of environmental concerns .
every year we will be completely different .
i really wanted to come up early this morning .
well now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
i never did .
you have stayed with me all the weekend .
yes .
why ?
the rent is each month .
that 's pretty cheap . i 'll take it .
what about roses ?
what do you mean ?
i 'm not sure .
have you had anything to eat ?
i 'm not sure yet .
have you changed a lot ?
no i have n't .
it does n't work .
no i can understand .
can you take a few minutes ?
but what can i do ?
it was my fault .
let s take a look at the policy . i d like to ask you a few questions .
here you go honey fried eggs .
oh come on . the tall one ?
the one that says mail .
yeah .
have you heard that he is in prison ?
does it suit me ?
what 's your best price for that person ?
why ?
he 's so handsome .
well what are your spoils ?
why ?
me too . i 'm impressed .
why ?
it s absolutely free .
what do you think about it ?
i 'm sure it is .
yes .
i hope you do n't want to think about it .
good . i want to think about it .
why do n't you think about it .
thank you so much .
goodbye randy . take care .
well i want to think about it .
that 's for sure .
i do n't want to think about it .
where do you want to go ?
don t worry about that . but you ll have to pay for it .
they are beautiful .
you should look in the future .
i have no idea .
so what is the wooden case with ability ?
thank you mr . jackson .
wow ! what is this ? where are you from ?
well the sale price is each .
i think a white shirt is ok .
are you kidding ? i bought it .
tell me what you want to do .
okay . i 'll see you then .
it sounds like you are a father .
yuan . i have to think about it .
let 's see .
i don t think so .
ok . that 's the best part . thank you very much .
i wish you good luck .
that 's okay .
why do n't you tell me anything about it ?
well we can do it if you want to !
good idea . i have to think about it .
i guess not !
yes .
hi rock sam ! how is everything ?
i do n't know . i only started looking for a job a few months ago .
thanks for everything .
i do n't know . they look delicious .
why do you think you re qualified for this position ?
thank you very much . i 'm good at my office .
it certainly was . . what about your boss ?
do you have any plans ?
what happened to him ?
i 'm ready to help . what are you going to do this weekend ?
could n't be better .
i was hoping you would come .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
how about your family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
three or four o 'clock .
that 's reasonable . what are your symptoms ?
i think its families are only for one child .
i think you re a lucky man . does your wife live with you ?
sure . i get along with each other .
you must be kidding ! it 's nothing like that .
thanks !
salt is my favorite .
but i do n't know why you have them .
oh really ? it looks like you did a great job .
well i guess i could n't find anything .
you mean i met her before ?
you 've got it .
okay then . how 's your family ?
what 's the matter ?
hey look at that bird . . .
sure !
thanks a lot . goodbye .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
just a minute please .
yummy ! yummy ! eat more !
yes what 's the problem ?
there is no problem . but we should have a try .
i like to online shopping .
that 's a good idea . which movie are you talking about ?
me too . i want to know more about you eg what 's your real name and what do you look like . . .
that 's a good idea .
i work for a large multinational company called dak group .
oh come on ! it s a good idea .
cool !
that 's true . but what do you want to do ?
i ll be at the airport .
then because you were in love with him .
i do n't know .
why ?
it is a job at a recruitment agency .
there is a very important job in the company .
yes there is . and my number is .
right . have you double rooms available before ?
what about a cup of coffee ? are you kidding ?
i hope that you enjoy your stay here . have a nice day .
thank you .
i like taking photos .
there 's a good movie called summer in beijing .
those are so good .
i like to play computer games .
hmm it 's a great movie . i love it .
oh it 's too bad .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
where did you get them ?
i go to bed twice a week .
of course .
it 's on the second floor .
you 'll have a try .
sure . it is a most popular dish .
how many planets are there in the solar system ?
sure no problem .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
no way . i will be scared out of my wits .
that 's funny i did n't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
hey how would you like to taste my fist ?
alright all joking aside what kinds of moves do you like ?
um let me see romance comedy . documentary action science fiction animated and so on .
that is to say you like all genres except for horror movies .
yeah . it seems like we do n't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
the notebook is this type of movie .
really ? i have n't heard of it .
well then this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you 'd love it .
ok . i ca n't wait to see it . let 's go !
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of <unk> friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night crying hoarsely and bawling whole <unk> of nonsense that i never understood .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will <unk> at you .
i got you . next time . i 'll preface a toast with a statement like i ca n't drink any more and then drink anyway .
really ? where is that ?
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i do n't know but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
i 'm not sure . . . well first it could n't be george . he is such a kissass . he 'd wash the boss 's dog if he asked .
no it 's not going to be george . i do n't think it 's andy either . he is involved with the boss 's sister inlaw . and you know how whipped our boss is .
that 's true . what about lisa ? i bet there 's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
lisa ? no way . i 've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors ca n't come out from nowhere .
well okay . then there is still michael . but he 's the boss pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely wo n't be michael .
no that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i 've got a family to support .
well it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hardass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
it 's very nice . i have n't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
well then may i invite you for the next dance ?
of course . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer . . .
do n't worry . i 'm not much of a dancer myself .
you 're dancing so well .
you dance beautifully too .
when did you learn to dance ?
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
it 's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
how about tango ?
oh i like it . it 's such a beautiful dance but i ca n't do it well . what about you ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hiphop or the foxtrot . the music has stopped
thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
ok . would you please put all your luggage on the scales ?
i think it 's about degree celsius .
what 's the weather like in spring ?
i 'm so sorry .
how can i do that ?
um . . . do n't forget to water it out !
i tell you what has been going on for tomorrow night .
i want to go abroad . i m not sure .
oh nice . where are you from ?
great . thank you .
i see . that will be fine .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
i thought it was the stop .
what does this happen to be like ?
he was a very good leader .
he 's got a scolding .
of course i did !
oh really ? how nice to meet you ?
that 's right .
it 's really good .
sue .
so what ?
i m afraid not . he lives in an office .
what 's wrong with it ?
that 's right .
do you have any other questions ?
yes he wears the clothes you want to buy .
right .
maybe i could .
but i doubt it .
sure .
no the one you have on looks fabulous especially with your hair like that .
you 're right . i 'll give it a try .
is there anything you want to wear ?
whatever you say .
i think you 'll save some money .
i could not agree with you . for us there s nothing serious .
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it our space shuttles are ufos .
i 've never thought about it like that before .
i 've seen photos of ufos in america before but they 've all looked doctored up .
do you think that there 's life on other planets ?
i think there must be .
why is that ?
it s primarily design for business transactions . that is write checks to pay the bills buying things and sending money . we won t expect a large amount of deposit in current account .
do you think that there 's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
no but we 're trying to contact them .
i suppose you 're right .
i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet humankind will not become extinct .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
there 's a lot of evidence that suggest it will but i do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon .
is that right ?
i m fine . and tomorrow ?
i wish i could do the best .
what happened ?
oh that s a good idea . go on !
yeah .
i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there 's anything we can do to reverse the damage that 's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we 've created for ourselves but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
to be honest in order for the earth to continue to be a <unk> place we 're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
let me see . that one goes for .
would you take ?
no i can t give it to you let you have it for . how about ?
. ?
sorry is the lowest i can go .
i like ferris wheel more .
do you have anything to declare ?
it s probably just about time we run . we re in the early s .
really ? then i guess i won t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually you might because there s a big convention in town this weekend .
i m not too worried about it . i always seem to find something .
let me check . oh oh ! it s at .
wow that 's cutting it close ! that means we only have minutes to make the connection ! what gate is it at ?
it 's at . . . gate .
oh great ! that s at the other end of the terminal !
ok so here we are .
be patient ! what happened ?
i 'm a teacher .
what kind of soup would you like ?
it s a very cool job .
what do you do there ?
i work at the polling place .
yes here you are .
is there a uncomfortable one ?
may i help you with something ?
read me the number !
my major was accounting .
what about your parents ?
because you can see the stars perfectly .
do you ever get lonely living at home ?
one hundred and fifty .
i like it .
my boss said i didn t have enough skills to do the job well .
i know i know .
i was married for three years .
then why do people get married ?
i have it now .
after what you married your father ?
i love my dog .
it s all right .
about seven years now . and you ?
here is the money .
i 'm not sure he 'll be back in about an hour at least .
i m so happy .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters my twin sister a younger brother and parents .
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
we are identical . i mean we look exactly the same but we are complete <unk> when it comes to everything else .
interesting . it 's great having a twin sister . are you best friends too ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn t mention to your biological father .
i don t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i don t have a blood relationship with my stepfather and stepbrother i consider them to be my real family .
what about your stepbrother 's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
no she also died when my stepbrother was little . my mother and my stepfather met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later .
sounds like it was meant to be .
i thought it was a teacher .
what a shame !
to tell you the truth i do n't know that .
basically what do you think ?
he 's not that bad . he had a hard time to get used to it .
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
i ca n't believe that . he would lose any weight .
he 's a bit conservative .
ok . i 'll ask him .
he was alone .
he is more nice than wise .
he 's checking bags . he 's an official in the customs .
i was born in january .
what did you do there ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
me too . i was lucky when they were young .
no they 're always busy .
true .
i went to the university of ohio in america .
what university did you have ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
you re a real man .
yes .
really ? that s great .
i traveled for three years .
what did you do there ?
no . i 'm a teacher .
i see .
my husband and i have thought about it but we ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of world we ll have in the future . what about you ?
i do n't know what they want to say .
for me growing up in a big family always made me <unk> for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share .
do you have any suggestions ?
yes i do n't think we 'll ever .
why do so many people think they 'll be ok ?
that 's true . i guess that would be a fast one !
it 's excellent . you know what i 'd like to do now .
i don t know what other people think but i for one envy only children !
that sounds great . i 'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
i 'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
you are a woman after my own heart . i do n't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
thank you for helping me . i do n't know if i will .
you are so kind .
well let 's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
let me think about it for a minute . let me think about it for a minute .
well . . . ? have you thought of it yet ?
no . . .
ok i will contact you in a week . see you .
that 's it ! that 's the one i was thinking of !
you really have a big head do n't you .
about years . how about in your country ?
about i think . everything is going very soon .
i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
did she ? that s great . however if we have too many children that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
but i think we need to save more .
he 's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
how old is he then ?
i had mine when i was . that 's a little young . i d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
yes i think you 're right . i m thinking about having a child but not just yet .
well there 's no point in my life .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them but they don t often succeed .
you might think most parents want their kids to be like that .
it s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient they might go wild .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn t have the money yet .
well he should pay you back . it s only fair .
yes but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill so i needed the money back .
well talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty did you ?
i guess you re right . i guess you re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship would you ?
i m not sure . i guess i d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
are you introverted or extroverted ?
i don t think you re right . what are you talking about ?
you ve been wasting your time on line for being a few hours .
no way .
yes you are right .
i guess they are .
that 's true . what do you think i should do ?
all right .
i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
that s what i thought . i just thought i d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway what did you do yesterday evening ?
well it was a warm evening so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually several other people had the same idea . i saw bill .
did you ? how is he these days ?
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
of course . what do you want to move first ?
let s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
no not very much . he s too ambitious and dishonest .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
i think i 'm polite careful relaxed and shy .
oh i do n't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
well . yes but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i 'm not as shy as i think . anyway you 're certainly not shy !
you 're right . i love going out and making new friends .
so you 'll be at my birthday party on friday ?
of course !
i wouldn t miss it for the world ! it s sure to be fun . she s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
if everyone turned up it would be a squeeze but a few people said that they couldn t go so i think it should be ok ?
are you taking anything ?
i ve got her a birthday present and i ll take a bottle fo wine too .
that s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don t mind too much .
helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn t be surprised if they went to the party too .
i think she would be happy if that happens to you .
well don t be late . i ll see you on friday at helen s .
it certainly was a great party . it s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn t bother me . that spilled drink won t leave a stain will it ?
i doubt it i 'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn t a glass of red wine i ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
i m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
afterwards we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks .
yes he s very good . . isn t he ? he told some funny stories too .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being very serious .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great but was quite strong .
that s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
very much . the birthday cake was delicious wasn t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes so i think everyone liked it a lot . how s that stain ?
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
well first of all it s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden which our dog loves of course !
so it s a threebedrooms detached house ?
yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room but i d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study so that s probably what will happen .
what s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
that s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it s really large .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
yes they are . that s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows .
do you have a balcony ?
no we don t . we wish we had one . that s the only thing we wanted but don t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .
you re right on the edge of the city aren t you ? there can t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
it s a very quiet neighbourhood . there s some traffic but not much . it s not very difficult to get to the city centre but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and <unk> them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .
that s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
most of the things were household appliance . you know everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
so what did you get them ?
i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
what s wrong with it ?
i wrote out a check for and it bounced .
household appliance don t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
i think it s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models the appliances don t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what s available but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it . sometimes i ll look at something in a shop but later buy it online if it s cheaper . you don t like buying things online do you ?
that s great . thank you .
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from <unk> companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to shop .
i m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i m a big fan of using new technology but i don t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .
sure . while you re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
ok . i ve finished online . let s go . i ll just get some money and my credit card .
thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
i guess i should just go .
how long are you going to stay there ?
thanks you too !
things are going well for me dr . smith .
not bad . but we have lost my wallet !
you 're right .
ok please do n't worry about it .
glad to see you too .
hi tom . how are you ?
thank you . goodbye .
good morning .
good coming . are you through with the cleaning ? if not we 'll come back a little later .
i would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
what size do you take ?
i 'm fine thanks .
not bad .
yes . you must be tom . nice to meet you .
barbara .
yes i am .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
you 're welcome .
she is but i think she 's better .
i ca n't be surprised .
i think they fit me very well .
it 's definitely a story .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
that sounds like a good breakfast .
i see .
do you usually travel by bus ?
it 's a secret .
you speak really well .
no i did n't .
are you planning on voting ?
i had to come in with it yesterday .
i am very impressed by your resume . therefore i am very interested to know why you re willing to leave your current company .
i could never help you .
so go then .
i am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
what 's the weather like in ?
i think it will be .

i want to book a tour with adventure sports .
excellent ! our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . let me show you some options . this is our most popular choice our river guides will take you
i don t really think i m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go home .
well in that case we can take you hang <unk> with one of our experienced instructors . it s the closest you can get to flying .
what ? you mean <unk> myself to a flimsy kite ? no thank you ! next !
mmm . ok . well why don t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge .
i m thinking something exciting but safer .
i have the perfect option this package will take you on a hiking trip through the himalayas for three days and afterwards there s a dog sledding journey !
that s more like it !
here you are .
thank you .
i 'm coming from fair oaks and las flores drive in altadena .
what was the score ?
that s right .
why ?
business . i have a trade convention i 'm attending in chicago .
me too .
i will be here for three years .
almost two years ? your english is very good .
thank you .
good . where do you go now ?
i see .
thank you . how much is it ?
i have been here for three years .
where do you need to be transferred ?
no i do n't have anything to declare .
why ?
i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife .
very well we have a couple of different options such as beaches the wilderness the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
i think something in the countryside would be nice .
perfect ! this package includes roundtrip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
that is the best part . your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy !
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful <unk> for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
i m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don t care what it costs ! money is no object !
do n't you have a reservation ?
where are you going to live ?
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
that s fine .
don t mention it .
that s one reason . i have to go there .
so what do you think i should do ?
no they do n't .
it s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don t you agree ?
it s service .
did you buy anything ?
yes i have .
did you use the internet ?
oh dear ! i 'm so sorry !
let s see . and what do you think of it ?
do you have any mixed drinks available ?
why ?
oh there is no problem .
how long is it altogether ?
it s about six or seven miles . that s about the kilometers .
that sounds ok . so we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church .
we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . then we turn right and walk along this path .
this path leads to the cave . can we look inside the cave ?
yes we can but it isn t very interesting .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
that s right .
how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ?
i think it will take about four hours including breaks .
that s fine . are there signposts along the way in case we get lost ?
yes there are . they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk .
no i haven t decided yet .
that s fine . congratulations .
don t you think so ? i d better go back now .
is anything else you need to do ?
they 're most advanced .
anything else ?
well for many religious people . but there are so many excellent ones .
i guess they are .
they are .
i 'd like to book a single room with a bath .
how many people ?
i 'd like a suite with an ocean view please .
thank you .
thank you very much .
that 's a fair price .
that sounds fine to me .
you re welcome .
certainly .
yes here you go .
apparently you have unpaid late fees .
yes i d like to check three pieces .
i m sorry sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at twenty kilograms each plus one piece of carryon luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two twenty kilo bags ? that s absurd !
i am sorry sir there s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me miss how much will i have to pay for all of this .
let s see . . . six hundred and twentyfive us dollars .
that s more than my roundtrip ticket !
where is it ?
i hope so .
yes it is . are you in a hurry sir ?
i 'm planning to go to seattle .
what are you going to do now ?
well sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
you re going to put your name on this list ?
yes i am .
i guess you ll have to pay your rent right now .
how much do you want to spend ?
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what does he want ?
would you like anything else ?
it ll be very convenient .
let me check sir . according to your file you spent monday evening watching titanic .
well the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
i did n't know you had so much time .
thank you .
great . make sure that the goods are sold very well .
you ca n't do that ! you ca n't charge me for a mistake that you made !
hey !
i know . i 'm sorry but i do n't know .
sure . i 'd better go home .
yes of course .
she will want an excellent restaurant of course .
i think you should make her own decision . what would you say about her ?
great . i appreciate that .
why not ? what 's the matter ?
great ! i like that !
yes . it 's telephone number .
i 'm sure you 'll like it .
she 'll be planning on cooking tonight .
i 'll try our best . with you i 'm sure she 'll be all right .
will you get any food ?
yes i know . maybe you should go to the bar .
perfect ! i like that !
i can help you with that .
of course .
orange juice scrambled eggs bacon toast and coffee .
i 'm sorry . we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i 'd prefer the filet but the porterhouse will do .
but i could n't believe it .
normally i would take you up on that suggestion but just the champagne will do for tonight .
you 're welcome .
that 's fine .
how much do i owe you ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port .
that 's fine . let 's tell you about it .
yes i 'd love to see what the alternatives are .
first can i know something about your financial situations ?
great ! how much is it for a copy ?
it 's two hundred dollars .
what 's the other alternatives ?
alternatively we do offer wireless in our lobby . you can bring your laptop down here .
that sounds like a good idea .
anytime you want to buy .
sure . what would you like ?
i want to make a deposit .
i 'm sorry . we have no more filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
i prefer filet but porterhouse is good too .

i will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown leaving the opening in the back .
what should i do after that ?
some of my friends tell me that being a teacher the most important is the beauty of mind . you should n't pay too much attention to your appearance . you should appear frugal and prudent . your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer .
do i have to pay for it ?
no .
is this ok ?

yes . i checked the box . it was for two years .
thank you for it . you 'll be right .
smaller than the others .

thank you . have a nice evening .
it 's very nice to meet you .
sure .
what are they going to do ?
well as i mentioned before i work in the company .
the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
i 'm looking for a citizen for my wife 's birthday .
what kind of business are you interested in ?
i 'm on a vacation .
but the key is too high .
yes .
no problem .
why not ?
that 's nothing new .
thanks a lot . bye !
what kind of shoes ?
what 's the maximum output ?
yes here you are .
i think i can do that .
we have the same idea as yours .
i know but i do n't really know about that .
we are glad to hear that . please give me a moment .
thank you very much .
thank you . we also need your prices .
that 's great .
thank you .
but they are too professional .
but it takes too long .
i have to think about it .
well the starting salary is dollars per month .
do you have to pay for this charge ?
yes sir .
are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ?
i see .
not exactly .
but how can you get that ?
it 's just a case .
why ?
about ten percent .
not really . why should you say that ?
that 's terrible .
not bad .
why did you say that ?
they 're hot .
that 's right . he was also a millionaire in america .
where is it ?
by the end of this month .
let me see . thanks .
i 'm not sure about that .
i only want to transfer .
thank you very much .
it 's ok . i had a good time .
from to o 'clock .
could you tell me what the problem is ?
yes i do . well to be frank with you tomorrow evening .
well i just want to be ripped off .
but other people are telling you the truth .
i m not sure yet . what s your job ?
what s your salary expectations ?
they do n't want to take any chances .
what s your salary expectations ?
she 'd say i have a lot of initiative i see the big picture and i do what has to be done . second i always meet deadlines .
what did you tell him about that ?
they would say i am a responsible friend and a capable colleague .
she 's a piece of cake too .
well mr . sun i see .
do you know anything about the salary ?
they say i am a wellmatched couple .
is there anything else you 'd like ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
that is a great idea .
they are sense of post mentality quality first aid ability emergency adjustment and law consciousness .
what are your salary expectations ?
i think a company is a place to get work done . certainly friendly open relationships among all company employees is important and i think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
do you know abraham lincoln ?
i will think about it .
that s true . what about your intention ?
that 's true . i work overtime everyday .
how much do you paid ?
i want to work parttime .

i 'm quite outgoing i think .
ok . i see .
i think that 's what i am doing .
what 's the problem ?
well i m very good with people . i m honorable . i work hard . i work well under pressure . and i m patient .
would you like to tell me something about your salary ?
i m afraid i m a poor talker . i m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business so i have been studying public speaking .
oh it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the <unk> mode .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
good idea .
of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ?
yes i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
yes it will print immediately .
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
we have thought of you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
experience is indeed very important but don t you think capability is more important than it ?
of course i 'm afraid not . but how can you prove to me ?
maybe you could hire me on trial if i m not qualified for this position you can let me go .
that 's a good idea .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
when is the next meeting ?
maybe you are right .
well i ca n't believe it .
then what ? i think i did n't know .
i m afraid i have to go to the dentist .
you 're right . i 'll talk to him later .
i have been informed that you are qualified for this position .
why do you want to work with this company ?
thank you . i will good luck .
yes speaking .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?

it 's nice to hear that .
of course . i like it very much .
so you can have more room for development .
thank you for your help .
good morning mr . li
it 's already o 'clock .
well honey wake up or you 'll be late for school .
go back to sleep then but only five more minutes .
i know but i 'm afraid it was too cold and my car could n't start .
karaoke has become a major entertainment . i wonder why .
i can t believe it .
well usd please .
i am still suffering from a little jetlag .
thank you .
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's great .
i would put them in the front of you .
it is very quiet and peaceful .
where is that ?
ok but you must stay calm . do you want me to give you a lift ?
do you have any vegetable ?
here you are .
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes <unk> and fruits .

not at all .
that 's great .
i do n't think so .
i see .
we need to work on that deadline .
fine . thank you very much .
not very good .
how much is it ?
thank you .
that 's fine . but why do you want to leave english ?
she speaks english fluently .
i 'd like to make a presentation on wednesday .
how about the alternatives ?
i 'm glad too .
it is ok .
thank you . let 's get started .
what 's the problem ?
i think the main point is to reduce their jobs .
as a rule we will allow you a commission .
i think it would be safe .
soup always makes me feel better when i 'm sick . i hope it makes you feel better too .
our agents in other areas usually get a commission .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign there is sales resistance to overcome we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a commission will not leave us much .
that 's interesting .
i 'll have to discuss it with my boss .
yes that s the one .
our agents in other areas usually get a commission .
i see . thank you .
thank you . i 'm looking forward to it .
we have to discuss this matter with you .
thank you mr . cooper . i m glad to hear that .
thank you .
it 's a pleasure !
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
maybe . i could try some day . but i do n't take them anymore .
thanks a lot . bye .
we ca n't put up with it any more .
ok .
could you make an exception ?
me too .
that 'll be fine . i see .
do you have any information about the city sights ?
i 've got a deal .
sure .
i think the inspection bureau at your end when effecting inspection only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly most probably escaped their attention . as the amount .
no . later we decided to opt for the prior outline version .
when will it be due ?
thank you .
let me see . laptop flash disk a ballpoint pen a pencil a notebook a pair of glasses cell phone charger moisture notion . . . oh that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes i am .
do you have experience in promotion ?
i feel my way to improve my work .
do n't worry .
it s on the th floor .
i 'll do it .
where should we go eat today ?
you have a list of extensions .
what 's that ?
actually i am only interested in making the job .
i 'm glad to hear that .
pardon ?
thank you !
i am sorry . that would be too hard .
i 've finished the first draft but the professor said it 's poorly written . i have to rewrite it . it 's so depressing .
and a storm blew our roof away .
i usually get a couple of days before the end of the week .
oh i see . where are we going to get a new job ?
i do n't know what you mean .
thank you mr . green .
then make acknowledgments as well .
thank you very much .

ok . how much does it cost ?
in addition they are waterproof and shockproof .
i 'll see you later .
yes i have all of them .
i am glad to hear that .
i want to but i m busy with work . it s the first day i can t afford it .
great . thank you very much .
medium .
why do you choose to work for our company ?
ok . so for me i can do it .
yes speaking . can i help you ?
i am calling to check your information before the interview .
that 's great ! thank you .
it is at the end of this month .
yes speaking . what can i do for you ?
i am calling to <unk> about some of your information .
that 's great ! thank you .
sure . the address is in front of you .
who 's calling please ?
but could you tell me when he will be back ?
ok but do you have some time next week ?

that 's all right .
forget about you .
no problem i think so . thank you .
i 'm looking forward to visiting your application .
i hope you 'll return this message .
how about this afternoon ?
thank you very much .
my strengths are my caring about getting the job done . i am very resultsdriven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . as far as weaknesses i really enjoy my work and sometimes i put in too much time . but by being aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
i need to go to the dentist .
you do n't need to worry about it .
yes of course . i ca n't tell you .
i 'm sure he can .
let 's do it .
what is it ?
ah yes i know that .
how about you ?
i see . and how 's the advanced course ?
thank you very much .
what do you think of his personality ?
he 's a team player .
thank you very much .
do n't worry about that . take your shirt with you .
yes i know that .
i m not good at speaking in public . i feel uncomfortable when i speak in public .
do you have any idea about other companies ?
no thank you
well i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms small window a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way the number of the telephone on your desk is extension . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
good morning mary .
good morning .
yes . how can i help you ?
yes i 'd like to report a case .
thank you for calling . for a moment please . i am happy to hear that .
thank you . that 's very nice of you .
well it is no problem at all .
will that be first class or economy seat ?
starting salary is a weekplus commissions of course .
is there anything else ?
goodbye .
i 'm amy . what do you do ?
it 's very kind of you .
that 's quite all right .
but how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
how much do i get to pay ?
sure . wait a moment .
i like playing basketball .
you can also go to the school 's sports field to play soccer and if you 're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .
i can t afford that .
what 's the matter ?
yes here you are .
the company will provide training new employees for that .
when are you coming back ?
yes with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl
don t worry about that .
it is just too much . don t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
wow i doubt that .
i want to work in marketing .
why are you willing to work for our company ?
i 'll do my utmost if i am hired .
i 'm glad to hear that . could you give me a pamphlet ?
it is said that our company is extremely happy .

i 'm sorry he is not in .

i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .

i 'd be glad to make it .
i 'm not sure . but i 'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
i 'll wait .
we have an appointment right now .
that 's right .
good . and how much is it for a copy ?
unfortunately i do n't have time .
tomorrow morning .
well mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully .
is there any difference in their short hand ?
jones can certainly take down letter more quickly but mary s short hand is the best in her class .
how about languages ?
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
um . that doesn t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
yes i am sorry . i missed the bus .
but there 's a bus every ten minutes and you are over hour late .
well i missed several buses .
how on earth can you miss several buses ?
i ah . . . i got have late .
oh come on gordon it 's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
well i . . . i lost my wallet and i . . .
have you got it now ?
yes i found it again .
when ?
this afternoon .
i am not convinced by your explanation .
this is brown speaking . i 'd like to speak to mr . tomas .
i 'm sorry he is not in .
when do you expect him back ?
i 'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
is there any other way i can reach him ?
i 'm sorry he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
yes please ask him to call me back later .
would you like to make another appointment ?
unfortunately i 'm leaving here unexpectedly and i may be away for several days .
i see . i 'll tell mr . tomas you 've called .
what are you assigned to do ?
you 're welcome .
i 'm glad to know that .
push the button !
i 'll give you a call .
what is wrong with them ?
you 're right !
cheer up .
thank you for your help .
there 's nothing that i can do to help .
don t worry about that . you should pay more attention to your manner style of conversation .
you 're welcome .
that 's a good idea . but i do n't know how to do that .
i can teach you how to learn english .
what should we do ?
why do you say that ?
thanks so much . my work is still on me .
thank you for your encouragement .
thank you .
that is a good idea .
thank you so much .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?
what is the proposal ?
your unit price is dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way i meant it literally .
i do n't mind . this one is still available .
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
hope it 's a deal .
at least this price is still a bargain . that 's the best we can do .
the best we can do for you .
i ought to make some money .
all right .
is there any cheaper one ?
can you explain the price ?
well i 'll try my best .
if you do n't mind our prices are higher the prices . we might as well call the whole deal off .
i 'm not really interested in that . but i do n't know what i should do .
how much does it cost ?
what 's the price ?
we need the wood .
of course . here you are .
i 'd like to go ahead .
how about some zongzi ?
what 's the point ?
i see . we see . . .
here we are .
fine i ll do that .
i d like to do that .
that 's what we need .
ok . thank you very much .
she 's in a bit of a rush . how about you ?
what about the kitchen ?
why do you say so ?
why don t you tell him ?
i hope so .
but i still ca n't do that .
what 's your salary expectations ?
it 's our pleasure .
thank you very much . byebye .
your price is higher than we expected . can you give me a discount ?
yes it 's good for you .
thank you .
thank you .
have you thought about it seriously ?
yes i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
ok did you find a new company ?
yes i will move on to xyz company .
good for you but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
she takes great care of myself .
is that all ?
yes .
well i am not sure . lets me check my agenda
ok .
what 's the matter ?
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around two fifteen pm .
sure .
what is the problem ?
i won t be able to give you back your deposit .
it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don t have this too often .
well it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason .
actually it is my mother s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ve got to be there right ?
you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval .
thank you so much .
that 's good .
let me check .
yes .
i understand your point .
i want to work in a teacher .
i can help you with that .
can i help you ?
ha i am flattered . actually when it comes to negotiate you don t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
well generally speaking if you want to change someone s mind or understand his position you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
ok as john after kennedy put it let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say the r d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers young people will love it .
certainly .
oh you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness <unk> . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
this is encouraging news good for you ! what is your solution then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set <unk> . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
sounds not bad ! better performance isn t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
because i want to be a stewardess .
right .
of course .
that 's right .
sometimes it 's good sometimes it 's bad . you have to like the furniture .
cool ! so what do you want to do ?
of course .
congratulations . you are a great team .
this is it ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until later .
i majored in international banking .
i d like to hear that .
why is that ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
of course .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
yes they are .
how long is the probation ?
you can start at the beginning of next month .
what do i need to know when i get the job ?
good . shall we say seven o 'clock ?
thanks a lot .
sure .
i 'm glad you are interested .
is that all ?
why do n't you speak to me ?
how much would you like ?
i 'd like it delivered it this afternoon .
no problem .
your flight takes off at
i can send someone over right now .
i 'm very sorry for that .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
would you please wait a moment ?
yes . all right ?
please come here . i 'd like to make a deposit .
that 's great ! so what is it ?
i am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . could you please come for the final round ? it is scheduled on the morning of next monday am in the hr manager office .
really ? i can t do that .
is there anything else you would like ?
i see . have you already done a lot of work in this company ?
i can provide you with that .
here you are .
i guess i could n't agree more .
yes i m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today s newspaper . is this position still open ?
yes but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
yes i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes my name is brian and my phone number is .
thank you .
your major must be computer .
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
yes i m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
generally speaking training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a oneweek training course .
could you tell something about the job ?
yes of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
oh i see . i believe i can do the job well .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday right ?
that s right . we ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project but it isn t due to be finished until the end of the month s
from next week on we should be in less of a rush .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
don t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
that s true . right . i m going back to the meeting . it s been going on for hours and there s no indication that it ll end soon .
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is uptodate with their work .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn t last too long .
they usually go on for ages .
i ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
i will . enjoy your meeting !
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i don t like the office . i don t like the staff . and i m afraid of you . and i don t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
not really so long as you follow all the regulations .
if you make mistakes in your job you 'll be fired . is that right ?
no . everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . the most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
yes . that s true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected . thank you for your help .
you can tell me the difference .
that s a good idea .
good idea . i m looking forward to watching it .
that 's what you want .
i have no idea .
i thought that would be a good idea .
what about the website ?
me too .
it 's a like that .
i still do n't know .
but what 's the date that they have to go to ?
why did you leave your last position ?
yes but have you made an appointment ahead ?
yes of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
just a minute please . i ll make a call to the hr office .
thank you very much .
i am very impressed by your resume . therefore i am very interested to know why you re willing to leave your current company .
you mean the network connection ?
yes i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
i have the same question . i can t send out mails . we d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
ok .
everything is just around the corner .
what 's the point ?
i do n't know .
let 's see . . . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take weeks on the open ocean and will be your responsibility you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles approximately a month from today .
fine . we will handle domestic shipping but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
no the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment you should be good to go .
is that true ?
there are many things you mean .
can you tell me about it ?
what 's the purpose of that ?
i think we should .
then what about that ?
we do n't think that .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
me too .
is that so ?
no problem . we also need to get the ball rolling on it .
what 's wrong with the quality ?
it will be about a month .
thanks a lot .
thank you very much .
is there a party going on friday night ?
how much would you like to have ?
how about your appetite ?
turn the lights off .
that s fine .
oh come on . i did n't know that .
it 's fantastic .
that 's true . what are you doing for the olympics ?
i 've got to work in the bank now .
are they all right ?
i think so too .
well when ?

why do n't you do that ?
ok i 'll . do that right ?
yes .
i can do that .
well mary and i 'm looking forward to it .

i feel so sorry for that .
the world cup ! the first match is today ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa
it s so small .
no i did n't .
but i ca n't afford it .
it 's mine .
what ?
you mean the man behind me ?
over there !
what did he do ?
he stays up untill all hours of the night and he 's never lifts to help .
did you buy anything ?
are there any interesting programs on tv ?
he 's in a good idea .
there 's no need .
i 'd better get coming .
how did you do that ?
what do you think about it ?
when the lower branches are removed you should be able to sit under the tree .
just a moment . . . yes i 'll do it .
how about this one ?
i do n't know . i usually tell you .
good idea . you can get close to them .
what do you mean ?
it s a program about islam . it s very interesting .
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
why do they go there ?
muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the <unk> centre of the <unk> faith .
when muslims pray they face towards mecca .
that s right . unfortunately so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large sacred black stone .
that s right . that s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims to reduce the chances of accidents .
pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
yes . in england christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the <unk> on pilgrimages .
isn t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . i don t think place is magical in any way .
of course ! it s a tradition to steal something like that .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
nope .
i can t agree with you . what s the point of gossip ?
i had no idea that there is something wrong with it .
that s good idea .
i do n't know . it 'll be a lot of fun .
you can say that again .
because it 's not good at school .
could you do me a favor ?
fine . how are you ?
oh that s terrible !
me too . do you feel like going to a movie tonight ?
oh i got it . thanks very much .
no i have n't . it happened to them .
i won t be surprised .
sure .
i know .
no you do n't have to .
when can i get it back ?
then the employer can send it to you .
thank you .
do n't forget to bring your id card with you .
i know . what do i do to deal with it ?
i think you should give them a try .
maybe i should try .
i want to know what they want to say .
if you take a job which will save you a lot of money .
what else do i need to know about the job ?
it 's a letter from nyu .
will you be able to take a lot of days off ?
do you want to know more about the position ?
i know . but what if i need it ?
you will need to leave them on as soon as possible .
i can tell you how to do that .
you could directly call your resume and contact information before the meeting .

i know .
of course !

hello ! i was exhausted some studying so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i m shocked that the police haven t caught the killer yet .
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well they ve got the money and she s going tomorrow for treatment .
i m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i m sure they are . oh and a local man won the lottery . i m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i m amazed that i haven t even won a small prize yet . it s so unfair !
don t be moody ! i hope you re not tired because we ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
we have hundreds of <unk> and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp s .
each mp belongs to a political party right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp s . they do not belong to a prime minister can cabinet members .
anything else ?
this is a small group of peopleperhaps mp s who are usually <unk> . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes it does because they have most of the mp s . most mp s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
they produce <unk> . these documents which states their policies . some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
