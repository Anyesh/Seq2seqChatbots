i do n't have any mixed drinks here .
i ve always got a lot of useful training .
how long will that take ?
yes sir .
let me have the babyback ribs .
sure . the chinese food is divided into two countries over there . besides it is quite cold in our restaurant .
i see . . . i 'd like to have some fruit salad .
why ?
but kids like them . i know little about them .
no problem . i can teach you how to understand .
why do n't you say that ?
here you are .
why not ?
yes the western food is excellent .
i 'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
we have french ice cream chocolate cakes and tomato soup .
red wine please .
yes . go straight ahead to the traffic lights .
do you know when it leaves ?
you need to get off on the corner of del mar and hill .
that 's so kind of you . thank you .
what 's the matter ?
i see . but i 'm good at sports too .
here 's the menu . it 's very delicious .
why ?
i think so .
any more ?
i 'd like a little milk .
it 's as simple as you want . they are very fresh and tasty .

ah ! i see . what else do they have ?
i have n't heard anything about it
yes .
thanks . i 'll wait over the new semester .
i just got paid . i have n't got the phone call to tell you .

oh these are the other things .
no problem . take care of yourself .
i would like to go to a fair price or just give you an idea .
another problem is that it could be ?
it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment .
oh no sir . now that 's a little more expensive .
your price is fine but i am afraid that your prices are too high .

the end of this month .
thank you .
no . it 's not included in your work .
do you charge for the room ?
yes i spent so much time sightseeing here . it is already so late now . i am afraid i have to find my swatter missing .
why do you buy so much money for it ?
that s it .
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
certainly . how would you like your suit ?
oh it 's really a little too small . i will take some photos of my wife 's cooking .
ok see you then .
thank you . how much is the charge ?
thank you . oh can you tell me how long i can take this key while i wait ?
certainly . as you come back to the service is your green one or two blocks down the aisle .
on the second floor . three blocks and you will have to stand a head over there .
how much is the price ?
one dollar .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
with pleasure sir . we do n't have enough carrots .
coffee only black coffee
eating here or to go ?
thanks a lot . i will take it .
oh yeah ?
may i try it on ?
i ca n't decide what to get .
a dessert ?
yes i 'd like some coffee .

yes . and i ll be happy to get it done here .
i d like to know if i don t have enough of this .
yes .
good . how long will it take for ?
certainly sir .
then what do i need to do ?
sure .
tomorrow will be fine .
ok have you decided what to get ?
i 'd like a beer . you see we do n't have anything on the menu .
i guess . what about you ?
could i reserve a table for saturday at p . m . ?
may i have the key for room please ?

well i 'd like to take a look at the timetable to get an idea of what sort of book do you want to start with ?
oh thank you . where 'd you buy a used one ?
but you know it 's very convenient and into consideration .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
but i still love you .
why not ?
ok . i 'll be there in a minute .
hi .
certainly . what s your name ?
i ll look for a ticket for you too .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
could you tell me if i have a look at it ?
i m not sure . you can get a month or rent as soon as you pay for the deposit .
i will try my best to get so that i can get rid of this house .
i 'm afraid you ca n't ma 'am . we accept only traveler 's checks and credit cards .
ok . here is your ticket .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks .
no you do n't . i just do that now .
how many nights a week is it ?
one or two cubes will be ok .
what is your date of birth ?
well it s cheap and twenty . it s the best price i can do .
but i still love you .
why not ?
the internet ?
thank you very much .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you re welcome .
sure .
could you make my hair short ?
here you are . what do you want to have ?
i think the red one fits me well .
i prefer the novels by hemingway such as the old ones .

it 's not bad . what kind of color is it ?
what do you want me to do about this one ?
i agree . i 'm really going to buy any new shoes .

of course . the fitting room is this way please .
how did the business trip go ?
d better to file it right ?
yes . how many hours do you want ?
let 's just hope our team is so difficult .

i understand . but why wo n't you show me the ones ?
i think so .

ok . do you have an interview with us ?
can you remember how quickly and record it right ?
i would like to cancel a check .
yes what size are you ?
they look all right .
i do n't think that shade of green will go with my complexion . do you have any of those skirts in my bag ?
it 's fine . just a moment .
yes . but i think it 's the same as this skirt as the old one .
then we should probably go to the nearby store .
that 's right . they were like i guess .
a good idea . he is also an excellent shot .
ok . let 's go .
that 's ok . you know digital devices are really popular .

i believe it .

that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
well i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table but i don t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . well i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the dusting and i do the vacuuming .

it 's on the second floor .
oh i see .
yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok i 'll take it .
no they re a prada <unk> for of the price of the real thing .

that 's easy . i am always excited about getting into such a job .
well i true but i still hear that some people in the city like to visit me directly .
yes there 's a lovely teapot . it 's made of metal .
the words a little bit the same for me .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
everything ?
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
i agree how much ?
you do ?
no that 's okay i already have a coke . why do n't you have a seat you look like you 've been on your feet all day .
so how about an <unk> ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?
stirred will be fine .
here you are .
thanks . which kind of medicine do you prefer western medicine or traditional chinese medicine ?
sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious nonalcoholic cocktail .

try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
it 's interesting . i 'll take one .
here we go .
it tastes great .
enjoy yourself .
yeah .
all right but i do n't like ice cream .
what 's your favorite ice cream ?
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
that 's a good idea .
i prefer apple pie .
what are they going to be there ?
mmmm . that 's not all . i will try it .
i think that the secret would be the best .
so you 're smart .
we have n't had a chance to get a master s degree in the wedding .
please give me a piece of pie first .
hmm i could ask you some for breakfast .
yes . the sliced noodles they offer are among the most popular shanti cuisines .
blah . . . what 's that ?
is that all ?
what do you mean by that ?
i 'm very sorry about this .
it really was the best food but the food was n't delicious .
i ca n't agree more .
well you should know that . i do n't know why you ca n't keep them so long .
oh i 'm not sure . several of the drove red underwear were destroyed in a city .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
yes she 's right .
is she alright ?
oh yes . she is too <unk> for her .
that 's ok . you 've done very well .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well they are collected by people who are trying to find them all sorts of things up in the mail .
thank you very much .
do you have any other alternatives ?
are you scared of anything ?
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with your service .
why ?
let 's have a look at the menu . oh there is n't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
so you have your own car ?
last time we went to the final match .
but it 's really worth it .
but that is also a big place to live .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
i have to go to my office at ten on friday .
pick up a wood and hold it like this interlocking your fingers .
why ?
you should be there by tomorrow .
ok . how about at ?
i am hurrying .
sorry in what lots of friends are like ?

he has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
how about you ?
i am happy to hear that .
what about her facial features ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a tenminute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello . is my bill ready ?
again ? i m sorry to hear that . would you mind giving me a room number ?
the machine says your card was declined .
sounds really good .
i have n't heard that people used it on the internet .
sure . no problem .
i don t need to be honest with you but i think i ll need to be more careful about that . thanks !
i m going to be home now .
sure them s .
what 's so important about ?
thank you .
goodbye .
ok . i will put it on my face .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .

she will be next month .
that is truly amazing !
how about taking a walk in the park ?

no i do n't .
you are a freshman in college .
do you think we should go any more drinks ?
hey . i 'll go to your lessons next week .
thanks . i really want to get a good idea .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
sure ? why do n't you shop around ?
i do n't know . i just saw the dress and thought about it .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
yeah it 's the best seller in chinese building . and i can help you at the moment .
no it 's easy . just take it easy .
we ? do you want to go with me ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
so let 's get registered tomorrow .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .
ok .
what 's the matter ?

oh these are the ones . you should n't take them .
let me have a look . ah this is unfair .
no you need to take some clothes off at the machine .
thank you . oh that 's fine . we 'll have to order them later .
what 's up ?
here you are .
what 's the price tag number ?
it 's about years old .
i know . why do n't you put a red light ?
i bought it but he was n't checked yet .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do n't talk .
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i love dogs . did you get any problems ?
what makes you say that ?
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i do n't think so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you are welcome . i 'm glad you are satisfied with your new products .
my pleasure .
what are you going to do now ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
before next friday .
no problem .
your flight takes off at
i understand .
i 'm not ready yet .
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
good . we will send you a refund of equipment before the date will be delivered .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
i want to know about it .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no it 's basically some traditional chinese zodiac stuff .
well . i was just thinking of getting a bite all this friday .

oh that 's unbelievable . i can t believe it .
that 's all right .
mmm .

well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
well the sale price is each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

i have to drive my car is better than done .
let 's take a ride on the subway .
yes . besides there are many cars .
yes we will all be let you know what happened ?
interesting ! how can they have such an easy life to do to get even ski ?
fine ! let s just ask me !
do you think we should go to a concert ?
no thanks . i 'm fine .
now that i know .
yeah . and maybe we could get a cab .
i m afraid it s not to be too difficult .
oh really ?
was it expensive ?

the hurry is coming .
how did you do that ?
where are you going to find out if you want to live in ?
i can t afford to ask you my candidate .
i know . it took me three weeks to find the best place in it .
have you found anything yet ?
did you have an apartment with you ?
is there any good news for me ?
has a house on its net ?
i ll get one for the assistant . and we ll contact them later .
yes sir . where to ?
wangfujing please !
ok .
i have to be there before .
great .
that 's quite a good idea .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
oh i almost forgot .
oh i see .
thank you .
no i do n't .
where are you going ?
could you please put me in the trunk and go straight ?
do you have to pay an additional fare to change ?
how about going to a game then ?
please pay around yuan for the copier .
ok . here 's ten dollars .
it 's a private garden .
what do you mean ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
that s no problem .
thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
what size do you want to go ?
oh i have got it .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
honey . let 's go .
just a moment please . i 'll see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i ll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i will call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi steven !
hi jason . good time .
i 'm been feeling too busy to get rid of it . what did you do ?
i m fine . let s call them .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh well it 's really exciting . have you been doing a lot of good ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
well i am very impressed by the company and i have been in college .
what 's just fine ?
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went to the personnel market this morning .
are your team a afternoon or two ?
he 's a bit like things like that .
what is your strongest trait ?
actually more than one . i 'm interested in the taxi is better than the bus .
he might have a friend who likes that kind of stuff . well what else do he think ?
what 's the difference ?
i 'm glad you can find some other food .
i see . thank you so much .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
yes . where do you live ?
all right i will make a note of this office round .
ok . i m going to start . . . no !
anything else ?
do you know how big it is ?
hey ! i m gonna get a beer !
ok i ll be finished soon .
i know . what are you doing ?
i 'll call to make a phone call .
what color are you looking for ?
i think a laptop is on my list .
you need to put your camera on ?
i see .
sure .
thank you .
so you re right .
yeah the packed in the water is a bit tight in the waist .
i d rather you buy an inexpensive camera .
okay so what do you mean ?
why ? i d rather have a try .
what 's it like to do with her ?
of course . this is a really latest bargain .
oh no problem .
oh wait ! i thought you had a wrong turn .
i am so sorry . i 've been dreaming of that . what else do you think about this ?
this is my last time !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
no what is the price ?
what a pity !
that s right . you can t have the best time to start cooking .
it 's really gross ! the kitchen god never goes through . it 's really frustrating .
do you have any other complaints ?
you 're paying for it because it 's only dollars per month .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there . it looks great don t you think ?
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
a new car !
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i like the idea . let s get a new carpet and the walls .
i have n't thought of that . and we have n't used an easy drop too long .
thank you .
mum when will we have them again ?
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do ?
we will give you a definite answer as soon as possible .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
how about a vacation ?
i went to bed a few times in the first time .
i am afraid not .
yes . i like cooking very much . i got this hobby when i was years sold .
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah . it 's a real revolution about chinese food . i ca n't wait to have tea or coffee .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly madam . what kind of suit do you like ?
what does a chinese one look ?
what a typical one do you have ?
but you could get a <unk> on the price .
do you want a lot of vegetables ?
that 's great . let s go !
of course . let s go . we need our summer wear .
i need them to be ready by thursday .
ok here you are .
i want a formal suit with a tie .
wow you must be lucky . i can t find it on the th floor .
i need to go .
i am sorry . he is busy now .
i was wondering if i could leave on the room .
yes it 's still vacant . is it on sale ?
i 'm afraid it 's an apartment and the rent is too expensive for me .
i can also come in on it at the moment .
all right . i will see you tomorrow .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i 'm ready to go . i 'll see what the neighborhood is .
yes . it ll take you through then .
thank you .
no . just bring yourself .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . we will be happy to get it .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's a nice neighborhood .
could you take a look at it please ? that s really cool !
how about the environment ?
i see . with my wife and i would love to take a look at a few more photos .
is that all ?
it s quite large in here .
maybe if it 's hot and crowded to the restaurant ?
that 's right . let 's reserve the bill .
oh that 's a great idea . we have a cat and a dog .
well it is great !
how about a sports car ?
i have been as long as you don t mean to absolutely !
but i don t know how to control it .
that 's it . but you know the unit has gone down in this backpack .
i love the beautiful lawn . let s play the front entryway !
let 's take it home .
well all right sir .
that s right .
hello this is the sales manager . what can i do for you ?
hello who is calling ?
oh do you see it ?
i have to think about it and i will need a place to see what is in the apartment .
let 's go to a dance party tonight .
yes . but i 'm still looking forward to it .
that is good . see you on saturday .
okay . see you then .
what are you going to do when you move in ?
thanks . i 'm going to do my best .
no . just bring yourself .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thirty percent ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
hmm . i ca n't understand why i 'm interested in a pc .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
where do you live ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
ok . do you need a shampoo ?
no i do n't .
sure i can . what can i do for you ?
a coldwave please .
how would you like your hair cut ?
.
yes i see . do you know the style ?
i agree . i 'm going to put on a double bed at the moment .
thank you . i 'm glad to have my own necklace .
yes . now you can wash your hair and then you 'll dry the massage as a little as possible .
it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
yes . the main thing is that i get to clean up my life during the summer .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that s right . anything else ?
oh it s really very good . is your father here ?
it must be my fault .
do you want to know there was a breakin ?
yes . that 's a good idea .
yes . we have a lot of <unk> here .
how about this one ? it 's our biggest pan .
oh i see . what about you ?
is n't that all ?
i 'm not sure .
i know . but you 're right .
let me check and check out the kitchen next to you .
let 's leave the house down to you .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
may i ask him if he wants to do something ?
yes that would be fine . but i do n't understand the details as long as the order is free .
well they pay me for a month .
could you let us know when we can check out ?
i think how long until you get the house ?
sure that would be good .
it 's a good idea .
yes let 's check out the flyer .
it 's life of two brothers and one or two friends .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
do you know if she would like me to do that ?
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
perhaps you can find a book that has no reduction so it will probably be easy .
that 's great . i will wait until i finish these brochures today .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about going to china ?
i prefer sea food .
i 've heard about chinese food .
yes they have been ready for a long time .
well i need you to wait .
well i like chinese food .
you must have thought of doing something so would you like for the main course ?
no i have n't . but i know how to try something new .
why not ? i guess you are quite right .
that 's fine .
do you think it 's good for me ?
all right .
i am afraid you will have chinese food . let 's see if you have chinese food in taiwan .
sure . wait a moment i 'll remember where to buy the table .
well could you help me with the l c ?
i like them . i think we should start to put a good idea .
i know . do we need to buy a small office ?
no . it s just around the corner .
ok i see .
you 're welcome .
yes please .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i 'd like you to say that 's what i want .
we have found some roommate that are destroyed in the market .
all right .
these are called combined with two weeks vacation .
oh really ?
yeah . it s a lot of fun .
really ?
yes . i know a good idea .
what 's more there 's a lot of stuff here .
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
that s true . i have a lot of options .
that s my wife .
here are your keys . do you want me to have a favorite style ?
the late fee is cents a copy .
we will definitely be able to buy some things at the price .
well how about these shoes ?
yes i would like to place an order for toner cartridges . we have a standing agreement with you company so we will need the same amount as last time .
do you have any of those skirts in my city ?
here it is .
good . i think i 'll take it .
no that 's enough . and i want to get rid of them .
and they 're on sale . . . i 'll go and get some chips .
do you have any of these skirts that i can use ?
well maybe you could ask me if i have an inch .
well why ?
what are the prices available ?
sure . this is my first time to get used to it .
i 'm not sure . do you have any of those skirts ?
well we should probably get started with you sir .
i 'm afraid we would n't help much . i 've been told that we would be able to work something here .
here you are .
how much altogether ?
are you sure ?
here 's your receipt . the store is in the shopping center .
sure what do you want to know ?
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is that right ?
it 's over there .
have you ever been to las vegas ?
it 's true but some of the time it 's kind of investment to save money they have to make sure they 're hooked up to smoking pot .
i am sure you can do that .
do n't get all of it !
now that i have to get the food ready . i m gonna have to think about it !
how come ?
yes they are . i could have known ice cream for sichuan and spicy .
what 's your parents say ?
yes . do you want to give me a few minutes ?
i do . i like cooking very much .
that 's really interesting ! you know it s a little too formal for me .
i usually use a recipe but i usually only use it to get a lot of things done .
that s great ! you ll make sure to take down your mind soon .
well fruits and vegetables are very healthy . i could learn to cook by myself .
that s a good idea . you should do a lot of cooking .
well i always get up at cooking .
sounds good . i guess we have a poor retirement room .
not really . i sometimes read a lot of animals and i believe it 's the biggest fun for family .
what else do we have ?
ok . food tastes good .
do you find something different about food ?
well i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
i 'm not sure . at all you need to put off your hands first .
actually that 's not what i 've got to do .
i 'm not sure . i 'll drink a cup of coffee .
i need to stay away from my doctor .
i see . well i 'll take some pork .
thank you . i think i 'd better take some advice .
not at all . you can always pay attention to the safety of the day .
maybe that would be nice .
mmmm . . . you have a lot of candy .
that 's true . i guess whether you like coffee is right now or not .
no . i m afraid that 's what i feel like is going to be an <unk> .
that 's fine . what about espresso ?
no it 's ok .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .

of course ! it says there will be a lot of people in the world and stop sign up for now .
yes . it 's really a ancient greek city .
i know but i 'm going to get into details .
why do n't we go to the center for dinner ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .

i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no i 'm a little bit tired .
you have your own vehicle ?
yes i do . i started using my bicycle to get around .

i 'm afraid we did n't .
let 's take a chance .

i 'm very sorry to say that i 've been seen the bear in my car with a friend .

how sweet !
no a prize for months .
you know if the food here is good there is a lot of work on it .
i didn t do that .
yes i am a little short on cash .
sorry .
oh it 's a good thing .
well you are probably going to put my resume in a newspaper .
i did n't know our first date in the us .
is there anything i can do to help ?

do n't you mean the right <unk> family ?
you said she want to do such a thing .
i think i want to try a new style .
come on !
i have been studying english since primary school .
i know what you mean . i ca n't give it any more .

actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
thank you for everything .
what 's the matter
he never see eye to eye with me .
how would you like to do it ?
do n't be too upset . it s not the end of the world .
i like cooking . but i just ca n't understand why you 're always so good at cooking .
good luck !
just soso . you re doing all right ?
i 'm going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left .
they 're in the same place . i bet that my wife is very much .

that s okay .
you can check out two books at a time .
my god !
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
how much can i keep the book ?
i think that s a good idea . what kind of books are the classes you want to see ?
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
you re welcome .
i 'm colin . it 's nice to meet you .
well it 's smith .
nice to meet you too .

you really like it . i think you 're going to be happy to get to sleep .
i 'm going to start right now .

yes i know it 's a lot better than the old one .

are you serious ?
sure . he s a very strict teacher .
that 's true . the words he should be told is really nice .
i was planning on going in a trip to beijing and a foreign girl .
if i were you i would get married some day .
more than six years ago .

yeah that 's my point .
well let me help you .
i had been in the class last semester . i was in high school and i did n't get a scholarship as well .
that 's pretty much like it .

did you guys go on a date already ?
oh cheer up .
why do n't you stay up with your continue ?
it 's not my fault .
well i guess you do n't have to worry about school .
excellent . you can give me a discount of an excellent deal .
was it a sale ?
it was n't as good as my price was .
how was it ?
no way . it s still amazing .
that 's pretty much what i did .
i think i caught a cold .
it 's hard to say something about . why do you think you 're feeling upset ?
oh i see .
hi .
are you kidding ?
i traveled the three gorges .
i bought some parttime jobs in canada and i got a job as a hobby .
that 's not a good idea . you have to keep proper records of your major interest .
of course !
what is your major ?
yes .
why ?
he had moved and held a party on july st .
i think she must be involved in both of her employees .
why ?
i see . do you have any other questions ?
i don t know .
that 's not a bad idea . for one day i 'm an excellent accountant .
that 's pretty much trouble .
i already have a car so i need to pay a deposit .
that will help you relax .
i was full of school .
that 's not as complicated as you think .
i have no idea .
i got it . thanks .
to be honest i have n't got much .

i see . it seems that many countries have been elected to do guess .
he told me that he asked me to give a speech in the family and i said he 'd better not give him a bad ten .
you are a real of that ? that 's not easy . you can give him a try .

you 're kidding . i just ca n't afford to waste time .
well i 've never thought about it that way .
it 's also a place to go out on a board trip .
of course there is a concert tomorrow evening .

yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
do you want to study together ?
sure . this library is too quiet though .
do you want to go to an empty classroom ?
that sounds good .
what else would you like ?
oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
wait a minute . i will write it down in the mail .
oh that 's it . what are you doing there ?

i want to be a professor in the future . i ll be very pleased with it .
i m not sure .

i agree .
that 's right .
i m fine .
no problem .
i need to get a passport .
what 's wrong with the sometimes ?

i forgot about that .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
do you have a seat ?
i feel so good .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
there are as many expenses you can see the short by price . it makes a total mystery though .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
most of them are not locked in the world .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to cancel a check .

was i ? sorry i didn'y mean to be . i do apologize .
that s okay .
forgive me darling . i 'm very tired .
that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .
yeah . he really does n't want a foul .
how can you stop having him ?
well you should consider him .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact potatoes taste better .
oh that 's how you see it .
yes it 's to my liking too .
say how would you like to be a dress designer ?
it 's my dream .
we drove to the place and you have n't gone to a great time .
i think it 's a good film .
but he just got to have more than a baby .
maybe not .
i think so . you ve made a good image in our company .
that s wonderful . actually i am a mother s mother . do you know how to get my mother ?
actually in the afternoon we are expecting an hour late .
what s the matter ?
well you ve had a lot of trouble on my resume . you could still tell me a lot about your goals .
so do you have to quit smoking ?
let 's go through the fresh air .
yeah that 's a good job . she is very pretty but she wants to keep living in love with them .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
oh i see . she should have gone to the library with her boyfriend .
she s probably got the point . why can t you start seeing her ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? that 's great !
what are you talking about ?
no wonder you were asking me .
that 's a little exactly what i was .
try it on ?
why not ?
me too . how about you ?
i said he was nothing but a <unk> .
no i do n't get any .
it 's very hand i ca n't find it .
but i just ca n't hold a second .
why ? what do you think of it ?
do you have some shoes on sale ?
yes it suits you very well .
that 's very nice of you to say so . i love it .
what does a mango taste like ?
i really do n't like it .
have you ever been to a hospital ?
oh i see .
you mean to me on the internet ?
i do n't say i 'm going to be tired tonight .
do you know where your polling place is ?
i bought a lot of money last month .
oh really ?
she 's the girl i 've been <unk> since i had a girl last year . she 's the first time she likes .
what 's her last name ?
i a so . it s a terrible idea to be true .

oh yes .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .

maybe i could help you find something .
i hope not .
i hope he can do something soon .
what 's wrong with it ?
but i think he 's more trouble .
can i try again on the same day ?
i did that .
oh really ? no wonder you 're so <unk> .
i did n't know anything about it .
yep . and i did n't say that .
yeah but the deadline for a week of december . and it is not all that happens .
you don t have to type a job .
yes . i 've sent my email to tell you .
i did n't know you were so young . maybe it s one of the best to get him to the office .
truewell do n't be so angry .
i remember on the cancer ward . i really appreciate there .
alright . i saw him played basketball with a bunch of moves .
i know that . they are like delicious food .
i do n't know . i did n't mean that .
will he do all right ?
that 's all right . can i have his phone number ?
oh yes .
was she really ?
ahahah . . . i 'm glad you like it .
that 's the problem . we should have it done quickly .
what 's up ?
how long did it last ?
i see . they all looks very healthy .
oh i really don t want to hear your excuses janet . we just have to keep up .
no they did n't .
wow ! i did n't know any different from him !
i 'm sure you 'll be pleased with their behavior .
thanks !
but i 'm not sure .
please wake me up at am .
i agree . we will try to make it as soon as possible .
no i have n't .
oh no ! that 's just a little more . . .
you mean you got it ?
are we having a sale ?
no honey you just need a new one .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
oh really ? how could i go ?
thank you . how much should i pay ?
yes mom .
do n't forget to ask your sister .
i 'll make sure it does n't matter . look at the mirror . can you tell me your name please ?
let me see .
what 's the price of going on ?
yes .
is it a deal ?
what was the one ?
or what am i allowed to do ?
i could use the book .
ok . i 'm sure you can do better than that .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
so it seems a little dangerous for me .
yes it is .
that sounds really nice .
i 'll take it for a try .
that 's all right .
thanks . i 'm lucky .
no thanks . i 'll have to get another cup of tea .
do n't mention it .
no that 'll be crazy .
good morning .
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
thank you for your advice .
well i ve had my bill so much . let me know if i am happy .
oh i 'm glad you 'll enjoy it .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i 'm sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
why did you say that ? it 's a good thing for him to live with his son .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i 'm afraid you 've parked on a double yellow line sir .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great ! let 's go to exercise more .
good . let 's go now .
better than before .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who will cook dinner will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what was the problem ?
i just stayed in the morning and watched the movie .
how long have you been with her ?
of course .
i am looking for an article in a newspaper .
that 's all right .
a pipe in my apartment is leaking .
so what did you do to get you to sleep ?
no thanks . i have a cup of coffee .
how would you like your steak ?
it 's not the right material . or the right color . i ca n't possibly accept it .
how about these ? they 're both fresh and they 're both very fresh .
just the one please . i do n't like it .
do n't mention it .
ok . thank you .
okay . that will be all right .
sure . we have all kinds of ice cream and serve you as well .
you can contact me any time you need me .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
have you bought it in a new house ?
yes i do .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
yes i do .
sure . here you are .
oh i 'm afraid it 's too large . but i ca n't afford that color .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry about it .
oh no i don t know .
thanks .
do you know what other advantages to go ?
i hope it will make you a lot of money .
yes it 's a great day . you should be happy this afternoon .
the price could n't be too long .
i guess they are just going to have to pay for it .
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing special .
i s meeting with my boss .
great . would you like that ?
yes . and i 'd like to manage myself .
i want to go to the states to visit the summer palace .
don t eat too much tv .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
thank you very much .
that s a bit stiff . do you know where the name is ?
wait !
i see . my friend has an accident on the way to take the plane ?
no problem .
i 'm sorry !
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
no you can t do that ! go away !
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday .
i have to drive .
of course i am .
well you are not very familiar with the job market . it is that all you need to find your brain and elegant characters .
whatever you think we re right . i just hope criminals are light out .
i d say you ve got a lot of homework to get ready . you look charming .
come on . i just want to feel a good piece of meat .
do you have the guts in my mind ?
really ?
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have to go to work .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
the water will not drain .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they wo n't need them to leave me very soon .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yeah you need to be careful next time .
what 's up ?
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
no but i did n't .
you know how it is ? i am a married team .
thanks a lot .
i think so .
should i walk ?
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
why is that ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
what ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
yes i am . my clothes just flew through .
it 's as plain as the nose on your face .
definitely . he must be a chicken guy .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he did n't have a girlfriend last week .
why ?
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
who 's your favorite group ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
ok . we never went to a cafe before .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes i 'm coming .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i know who we should play volleyball .
let 's go home and find a crowded place .
oh i really hope it will rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
i m happy to hear that .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no i ca n't .
yes so you could be serious .
honey i 'll get a shot .
yes .
ok . honey i 'm always willing to have a good offer .
what would you do to deal with it ?
thanks .
i 'm sorry i 've gone to the gym right now .
well you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proofreader right ?
what 's the problem ?
i know . well they re worried about the older guys like them .
congratulations .
you must have been silly .
what do you mean janice ?
i have had a low fever these days .
have you got any experience in mind ?
you mean we have to give her an idea ?
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
my mum .
what was your call about ?
good . how about you ?
sorry . i 'm afraid we have n't sold out .
i ll look for a ticket for you too .
thank you . which gate should i go to for the bus ?
i 'm very sorry about this .
excuse me .
yes .
should we walk ?
yes it is .
because i 've already proved it . smoking 's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i 've done it hundreds of times !
you spent the dog for a car .
i see .
yes it was horrible .
i am not sure . but i really have to learn to take an emergency room right now .
don t worry . i ll help you .
let 's meet half way around her .
sure . is it a cell phone ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
where did you say ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i 'm not really into them .
what are those of good things ?
the one that says that you use red ones and those are the ones that you need to choose from those .
i do n't know . i just don t want to give it up !
i 'd like to try to put them in a good piece .
it s a popular game of playing basketball monday night .
dad i got a <unk> .
not yet . i am still hungry .
i m a real friend of a friend .
i like spring .
that 's too bad . it s as good as your city .
and what kind of sports do you like to be ?
do you mind if i asked you to tell me about the special christmas ?
let 's just sit in the back . i 'll tell you about it .
what color do you buy ?
how much is the students are ?
well i know . but you 're right .
ok . i will .
you know i was eating very good .
well now that it 's not about ready to teach you how to national sport .
we jumped off a bridge and fell feet before the bungee cord caught us .
well the only thing is that there is n't any damage to the game .
yes .
how many kinds of sports do you have ?
yes i mean it .
hmm . . . how about the game of new york instead ?
well i am very happy with you .
that 's right i think i 'll play on these .
it 's such a large bag .
he must be studying in college .
to tell you the truth i 'm going to be my fault .
certainly . i love the picnic .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
no i 'm not .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh no ! he 's a kind of guy which is that like information ?
why ?
what did you read about that ?
you should have a little bit of teaching .
sure . i 'll be finished on friday .
is it expensive ?
oh come on . i 'm just trying to get into the internet .
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss even though we are very different people . because i 've had a number of bosses i 've come to realize that to make things work you have to understand what 's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him or her . it 's natural to think about your own
what about your boss ?
that may be true . i think they are very impressed .
how could you be so sure ?
well just say that again . it 's just that you need to write me a letter of recommendation .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
we can also get a burger and some foreign friends from dinner .
all right . i 'll leave it to you .
i 'd like to . but i 'm not myself .
it 's all right . but there is a lot to see you .
yes she is . she is n't even her mother .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
he 's a foreigner man .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
well i 'm really sorry i thought it 's going to be a good idea .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
is it broken ?
economy ?
yes i know . they must have excellent news .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's very thoughtful of you . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
no . it 's always busy with the internet .
that 's a great idea . it 's very romantic to have a good read .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
actually i like both of them . they are both very good .
that 's interesting . do you take any money with me ?
each of the newspapers or the radio is becoming quite different from the fix .
i see .
that 's all right . please take me to the doctor 's office .
oh i see .
it means that the goods are using from soils or groundwater systems and animals are likely to stop smoking . they need to build their car from alternative transportation .
to be honest i think that world is very beautiful .
really ? i want to go too .
oh just two .
i saw him before .
no i am not sure .
how many people were there in the net ?
i agree with you .
yes that 's the point .
i see . are there any other symptoms ?
yes they are .
no . she died of her life .
that 's good .
that 's right .
yeah . he is a hard worker .
how many days have you been ?
yes some friends have been walking for two hours .
such things have been changed .
i 've never heard that .
i feel nervous about that .
are you a visitor or a resident ?
you have n't had any professional experience so i know she has a record of her .
there is a doubt that he should be writing in america .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
yes . our guest team is really tough .
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .
yes it 's just where i 'm going to get to the passport .
hello !
hello ! could i speak to sheerly lim please ?
i 'm colin . it 's nice to meet you .
what 's your name ?
ping .
what 's your name ?
i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by to at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has .
i knew it was a hard game .
a little more than i did .
let me tell you now .
did you see his last dive ?
yes it 's perfect !
he 's diving for the gold .
just watching some tv .
how about having a party this friday ?
he 's really cute .
he must be very sad .
i 'm sure he 's an excellent team .
is he getting his excuse with his girlfriend ?
this is not easy to get to the olympic stadium .
i know but i always liked him .
ok i 'll look forward to your table .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil to .
i think tom would get that idea .
you should do well . look what are you going to do if you get dressed up ?
you 're right . he 'll get used to it .
yes that 's the poster of him .
what 's in the hall ?
he 's right . i think he 's got something wrong with my boyfriend .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
she is a beautiful bride .
i am so happy for them .
are you crying ?
yes i always cry at weddings .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .

i 've got my business card and my boss is having a dog on me .
well let me try that . i 'll try some local specialties .

just a few minutes walk .
what s the problem ?
thank you .
thank you .
i would like to go back to school .
how about having dinner with me ?
yes let 's go .
yes i did .
are you serious ?
yes i liked it . was the film a bit strong ?
sometimes they are just but not true .
hi steven !
hi jason . good time .
i 'm been feeling too busy to get rid of it . what did you do ?
i m fine . let s call them .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
oh well it 's really exciting . have you been doing a lot of good ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
well i am very impressed by the company and i have been in college .
what 's just fine ?
do n't you hit it off ?
i began to went to the personnel market this morning .
are your team a afternoon or two ?
he 's a bit like things like that .
what is your strongest trait ?
actually more than one . i 'm interested in the taxi is better than the bus .
he might have a friend who likes that kind of stuff . well what else do he think ?
what 's the difference ?
i 'm glad you can find some other food .
i see . thank you so much .
actually i do n't play either one hand and i can listen to music .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i think the shows are very informative and it 's a good waste of time .
yes . i m pretty good at playing games . i have to learn my favorite ones .
that sounds great ! you know i am really sick or not as well as you could get back to me .
i love to play with my friends .
can you solve the problem with your language ? i 'm sure it 's easier to make your wife and easier to date with this kind of radio .
sure . it 's a good way to watch it .
we didn t talk about yesterday . it was the first time .
i think that we 'll get a <unk> .
that 's what i 'm thinking . i do n't have any single time to think about my friends and i have a good time to think .
yes i remember him .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
heard what ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
what happened ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
did n't he have miles ?
that was a little too small for me . i saw him just between the beans . he was a bit naughty boy and he got revenge .
it is really worth trying to clean your room .
really ?
i 'm just worried . what if it does n't tell me ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
terrible !
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but i need to get my hair done .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he make such a change ?
wow . you have to teach me how to play on the campus ?
let me see . how about a game of bridge ?
good idea . i can teach you how to swim .
what 's your favorite color of his novels ?
absolutely . and it 's very convenient and you can preview all the songs .
that 's so convenient . if i 'm in a hurry and i 'll pop over to the phone !
wait a minute . i will take it .
to tell you the truth i do n't really feel like it .
i can help you with that . would you be willing to help me with my own food ?
no but i did n't even notice that . i ended up in a traffic jam or a bit of a child .
i got it on the cafeteria .
oh i remember she forget it when i met her from shanghai . what did you do ?
yeah i remember her actually i 'm a manager .
he did n't have a fight .
i think that 's a time to get a <unk> .
she was a very impressive resume .
that 's great !
welcome to china .
we try to use the machine .
ok .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . is there anything else ?
wow . that 's quite a lot of people are allowed to eat how many people are there ?
what do you think of it ?
what 's the difference between these two countries and it ?
no it 's correct .
good for you ! i do n't know how to surf the net . it 's a good idea to start your hands and compare .
i think we should be able to find as soon as possible .
you bet .
because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before it will do you harm .
that 's great . what 's the name of our school ?
you know red yolk is proved unnatural . it 's artificial and may lead to cancer .
yes i see . i do n't like it either .
it 's just on the street . i do n't know how to get there .
and then when did you buy a car ?
the party starts at .
it 's quite convenient . by the way is there any way i can go now ?
i 'm going to get a table for two .
by the way what 's the rate today ?
where did you go ?
got it . hey i do n't see it .
thanks for calling us .
thank you . and you 're mr . jones .
thank you . i just got back from now . how do you like it ?
i love it ! thank you so much .
but that is a big mistake .
the biggest city is basically in the world and is regarded by the chinese as the most important holiday of the year .
what is it ?
i guess you 've already asked for our wedding anniversary .
have you any special food in your country ?
there s a children who is good for their children .
sounds like a firecrackers of forbidden city .
really ?
wow . it 's convenient . people will love it .
well the money is not going to be counterfeit . so you will have to pay some money .
oh that 's great . i want to go all the way .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good .
what about these things ?
paris in the world .
what if it tried ?
that sounds like a good idea .
sounds really interesting . what else do you use ?
yes . how can i use my visa card ?
cool !
oh you 'll use this computer .
in a month .
i have to wait but it 's just too expensive .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
thank you . we have a happy birthday party .
have a .
oh the <unk> is so beautiful . i am ever in the garden section .
well i suppose the price can be a lot more expensive .
it 's . but it 's us dollars .
can you leave me a check ?
i am afraid i can t .
do n't worry . let me know where you can find a roommate .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
that 's lucky .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well we still have six more than that in the whole world !
congratulations .
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it was a great game .
that 's terrific ! how did you go ?
it 's really worth it .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
thanks .
i usually only use my pen in the whole manufacturing department .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
thank you for your help .
no thanks . i 'm full .
yes . thanks .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm not enough .
oh . i 'm not so sure about the time .
why should i do that ?
i guess i might as well send one or two of them to be across .
no not really . i 'd like to talk to the boss about that .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you have any experience in the lottery ?
yeah . i was in so late today .
really ? what kind of company did you get ?
yeah .
great . i 'll give you some information about the job .
i hope so .
you are welcome .
ok . see you later .
i think i 'm going to get a good job and they are very quick .
no it is n't .
well i was wondering what the salaries are like ?
well i 'm afraid .
nice to meet you too .
i love to dance the fast music .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i am a light fan of shoes .
no i do n't but i find the modern step by saying that when i have a taste .
yes . chinese certainly is the homeland of waltz .
why not ?
they are all a very good match .
yes it 's a general name for several laws related to the chinese culture .
i suppose they will play mountains with other languages .
as most of the time they do n't serve dishes . as long as the table is built in the us they should n't accept any <unk> .
that 's fine . i think they can add them to my education .
there are several reasons .
they 're got any good reviews ?
i 'm not sure .
yes it 's a great job .
you may choose from the fish and beef .
ok . i like it very much .
great . here 's a dance .
i know . i ca n't wait to dance .
then you must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
oh good . you guys play a lot of exercise ?
you 're a good dancer .
really ? how long does it take to get to the disco ?
no thank you . i like it very much .
let 's take a look . why not ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
thank you for your compliment .
basically what if i need to see your id card with you ?
oh yes .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
i know but i like it .
yes i 'd like it very much .
oh yes .
that 's a good idea .
a good idea .
oh that 's wonderful . thank you for the dance .
it 's very nice .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor breakdancing .
oh yeah . beer is so good . maybe you can dance to the dance .
my pleasure .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
do you like swimming ?
yes . but the entrance is already included .
put it there ! in senior high schools we use will give you a lot of attention .
absolutely .
what if i can teach you ?
yeah . it 's really cold and rainy .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
okay i 'll take it .
i really miss the change of seasons like clean as the color of the air is a little too hot for us .
i like it but i do n't like the weather either .
yes it is so cold . i have been looking for an hour .
i like autumn too . where 's the autumn is the best time of year ?
i like summer too .
well it 's supposed to leave soon .
yes they are .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love it too .
yes but it 's really cold in winter .
i think that 's all right .
not really . people are warm up in the south .
right . this is the best place to go .
how old is she ?
i 'm glad you like it .
it 's very kind of you . i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it was a pleasure .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for airsickness ?
i 'll be back on tuesday .
mr . chen will arrive at a .
i 'll see you then .
yes . . .
what 's wrong with you ?
i 'd love to .
how about you ?
is it a good idea to go to the school ?
yesterday . she wore that gown last night and showed it off to everybody at mr . mile s party .
may i have your name please ?
do you want me to cancel your appointment ?
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
my bumper is smashed in .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
oh come on ! i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
do n't mention it .
that 's what you need to do .
yes i 'd love to .
i guess i can help .
did he ask you to do something ?
yes he 's very fond of him .
i 'm glad to hear that .
i am eager to study chinese food .
i am sorry to hear that . you ve made such a good decision .
i can just hope it does n't work out right now .
no i 'm afraid i can . i 'm not myself today .
how about tax ?
this friday evening ?
are you sure ?
well i think we can .
that s my point . they re the queen balance .
i 'll say that .
yes i have .
hi ! i m going to be a volunteer for the job of a month .
do n't worry about it .
you re welcome .
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome .
not really . when i was thinking about playing you i really wanna be a movie .
i ca n't forget about it .
yeah . but she definitely gives me some sense .
is she anyway ?
how about you ? i can help you to keep it and give you a second thought .
i 'd love to see that .
oh no .
right .
that 's not bad . you should go to the gym too .
i am very sorry to trouble you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
yes it 's so many years of people here .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
why do n't you try and give it up ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i was so impressed with it .
i 'm glad you did n't hear something about it .
how about this one ? it 's just a job .
i am afraid it is not all that formal .
thank you very much .
right . i think it 's worth it .
yes i did . i have never seen the fashion before but they just didn t seem so interesting .
it 's my fault . i ca n't stand it .
very interesting . so it seems like some sort of media did n't it ?
no you never know ?
yes . i 'll take the buy .
okay .
do n't worry . i 'll go to the movies with you .
it is easy . take some time to read and see how you feel .
that sounds like a good idea .
yeah . let 's get the started .
fine .
of course i know it but you know it 's hard to quit smoking .
and you know her ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should quit smoking .
yes certainly .
sure . i 've seen them in chinese embroidery .
i suppose they are all excited .
wait ! let s get a shot .
actually the woman in the race is a very funny .
but dad i love them ! i hate watching television !
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
oh i see .
i know .
sure . i need to have a house .
i think a friend of mine is going to take us almost every day .
the time starts on october th .
excellent ! how many pieces of it does n't look like it ?
then my son drove into a tree
maybe i 'll just go .
i 'm hungry . i bought a few things to eat .
good idea .

i think she 's causing you . why is she want to leave her ?
about half a year .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
she lives in washington d . c .
no i twisted and turned all night and couldn t sleep . i was worried about my mother s health .
what was your favorite writing ?

he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the smartest young man .
that 's right .
oh . . .
is n't that bad ?
i 'll be there on time .
i 'll be home . do you have some day ?
it does n't matter .
are you serious ? you 've been making her hard time .
well that s really no problem .
yeah i saw a lot of english on the internet .
good idea . where shall we go ?
yes . but i was in college now .
oh is it a year ?
no i m a little out of hand now .
i feel he 's a shoulder by me !

why not ?
i wonder why he can date the first .
he 's a captain . what 's your name ?
yes . he must be back to bed .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .

i only paid two dollars for mine .
what happened ?
i do n't know she 's the best way to go .
yes i did .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
yes i can . it 's like the radio is on .
how about going to a concert ?
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
i like watching it on a radio . it is said that people can enjoy the tv .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .

it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .

i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
they do n't have people there .
really ? are you more interested in any more ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
she 's a little short on me .
you need to be careful .
tom that lucky guy .
oh he is all right .
i hope that he lost his job and he doesn t find out a way to control .
she is tired .
oh it s fantastic .
i want to buy a new car .
oh that 's a crush .
really ?
very good . he 's always caught a good neighbour .
are you sure he is .
are you aware that you ran through a red light ?
you have a lot of films in the city . you know more about a game .
that 's true . she is almost years old .
yeah you 're right .
you should have thought about her another word i really do n't know .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i thought all right .
my hair was supposed to be delivered today .
no wonder you were such a genius .
a man came into the bank with a gun .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that 's when he was in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
they 're quite competent .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right .
you 've had an important interview ?
how did you get so excited about your teacher ?
thank you .
i want a nonsmoking room .
he said he had a performance in the city .
what did you do after your family ?
no . i want to take a look at her .
that s too bad . take care of yourself .
did you know that she is trying to give you the gift ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you guys don t have much time for me .
i just don t understand him .
i see . but if we were not common enough we would have to keep them away from us .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that s great . they tell you what happened to a fortune .
yeah they are .
maybe you should give him a try .
do you know what you have in mind ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
yes he does .
well it 's no use . i ca n't help you on your toes .
it seems that they are somebody from two countries . so i am interested in a quiet situation .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then what did you do ?
i have a dog that i can t go to the gym anymore .
but i like girls with roses .
sure . we have a great variety of cereal .
why do you think many children are good ?
really ?
who is your favorite hip hop artist ?
that s right . i just want to find out what is suitable for me .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !

my great .
really ? i did n't know you had a good time .
five .
how do you make up your family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
that 's right .
that 's true . in my country your mother wants to do something about it .
i think that families are only familiar with each other and those who are only familiar with each other .
i guess using my parents are a child . they must have older sister or young children .
sure . i get along well with each other .
i bet he 's so cute . what did he do ?
thank you .
a friend and i are planing to go out why ? what 's up ?

then how tall is he ?
what does she say ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !

i think that we can make the same opinion of its beauty is much better than by other countries .
do you eat some chinese food ?
he is a lawyer .
i think that must be him .
sure . it s too expensive to ask for a job .
sure . they re ok .
well i m getting off for a bit now . we re going to have to be able to fit all the time .
oh . i could not do anything else .
that crazy guy .
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .

what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .

yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !

i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect . could n't be better !
bye !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
well i could n't come asleep instead of talking to you .
good idea . what 's on ?
it was all very kind of .
yes .
sorry he has gone out .
this is joey from mary trading company . i learned that you are the leading export of cloth by <unk> company .

very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
thank you . i ll call you later .
you re a real pal . i ll be here for you now .
okay . now that one is good .
you can t do that .
i think i am beginning to have an asthma attack .
i m so sorry . i think i ll be .
that 's right . how 's the companies ?
i 'll get that you 're such a fool of it .
i understand . i 'm going to have to write you a prescription .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
yes . you have to pay for the safety of the company .
do n't forget to put in with each other .
to tell you that if there is anything i can do for you please let me know . i am sure you have to wait for a few minutes .
i see . is it possible to pay for this insurance ?
i see . and if you 're sure you will need to see your passport .
can we use some money from that company ?
you may list your name and job information before you come in .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i 've found an apartment downtown . where can i live ?
oh i 'd love to .
you have two reasons .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's pretty hard to live at home the rest of my life . do n't forget to live at home the end of my life .
well they want me to teach you how to live on my own . they know how to live at a school school school is more if i have fun .
i see . the best way i have is to learn how to use it .
i 'm buying my uncle 's parents .
in what way do you live ?
no they did n't . they were too happy that we did n't have any .
do your family have a brother ?
eight years is a real family . my mom would be willing to live together .
oh yes .
what do you mean ?
so i will take care of everything for you .
yeah . you can get a sports program if you do n't have time to watch the net for missing classmates .
how about call them ?
thanks for letting me know .
what happened ?
yeah . so he get the hang of it .
what s the matter with the girl ?
he is a french fellow .
i like to get my passport by myself . i think the same thing .
they were like to but that s not the tradition . they were just thinking of all day .
yes it s quite reasonable .
yes . i used to go to the gym a week before but i wo n't go to see them .
oh really ? i thought they did n't do that .
tell me how could have been that ?
well . about your stay home before we finish .
she works as a nurse .
i hope you re right .
what about your mother ? how many years have you been learning ?
is there a lot of people who wanted to ask about if we have to work with them ?
i think you are right .
i ve been out of town .
really ? how often ?
i ve been back to yale with several countries .
really ? when did the last time ?
yes you are . i am on the th floor .
no i did n't . but i don t think we have a beautiful time .
oh yes you 've been here for two years .
i m fine . and i also like both of them .
i see what you mean . i just like to play games and if you have n't been to a few hours .
it was no big deal .
yes . i am a member of the basketball club .
do you have a hobbies like playing computer ?
i used to play golf if i do n't mind . i just need to use my bike to get some exercise to keep fit .
you need to build up some weight . that 's why i think . you should exercise more than a regular exercise .
i know ! it s a good idea to save money .
actually i should be able to exercise every day but you should keep fit .
well do you have anything to declare ?
i will call you when a computer is free .
ok . you re just looking forward to swimming .
do you like it ?
i have a lot of nerve to go on my own .
oh that s great .
no i did n't .
do n't you know how to play piano ?
right .
sir you were playing chess all afternoon and there s a big difference .
you too peter ! do you know what other football is next ?
come on . you know i just got a lot of reading and other things .
come on . it 's an american player and you will play well .
well just for the next end of the campus .
most of the time i would like to watch baseball .
my favorite is to play basketball .
a little bit less than that ?
well i had a question . you know i m not as familiar as i just had .
i think that it s just that it s about me . you re right .
i 'm sorry . i did n't even notice .
i know .
sure . i d be glad to exercise more . i ve got a lot of homework too .
good idea . i have to walk now . can you tell me about it ?
that s a good idea . the basic rule of doing is that the work is very important to me .
oh good . so we should be more careful .
of course . but we should learn more about them .
yes . i tried opening up some exercise a day but it is easy to breathe .
what about your trainer 's favorite dance ?
where do you think is the idea of your plant ?
yes it 's been crowded by many people .
so how long has he here for ?
i do n't know . elvin has to say anything .
i 'd like to take a look at your stereo system . you know i 'm done .
i 'm glad they say that .
i hope you do n't love it .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
what is it ?
well i am coming to get ready to you . i can say if you want to do something different you know .
you 'd better do n't have to tell you i 'm sure you were pleased .

not bad . how about you john ?
yes . but no . . .
what do you mean ?
i 'm fine .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
let 's go to aisle to pick up some pasta for tonight .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
as long as you are him i can t keep it from the sad guy .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes it was a good player and he had a lot of funny .
how can you do that ?
oh yes that does not belong to me . i just do n't know how to handle it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
they are very helpful .
how do i need to pay for the registration ?
i 'm afraid that 's out of stock at this time .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
the song has stopped by its song .
i do n't believe him . he was only a heavy smoker .
of course that 's my business card .
i do n't have much time to waste .
she is a bit nervous . you have to make up her mind by herself .
that s why i want to ask her to make sure she didn t want to get a job .
really ?
that 's right .
i am sure you will .
well i 'm not sure how to sing !
what happened ?
i 'm watching a football game .
fantastic !
it 's got to me . we just got a new leaf . i am going to have to call in the next few days .
is he sir ?
yes . he told me to do it .
it must have been all these years .
in the air .
oh yeah .
yes that can make you yuan . but i 've got to stand this switch over .
no there is n't a time to play .
do n't get it done .
i am so sorry i wish i could take another photos .
we should have stayed in bed for more than ten days .
right .
the flight leaves at and your boarding time .
do n't you think it 's a good idea .
how do you do the housework today ?
the company is very competitive and i do n't know what to do to help . i can always get large pay the hours of the platinum card .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
that 's good .
and swimming is very good at swimming .
i 'm afraid not . in fact our summer vacation has a up on noisy street .
good . i was thinking about that .
no you will give me a raise .
how beautiful is it ?
thanks . it is an amazing new life .
that 's right .
that 's crazy .
oh good . you can study together .
i 've always gone to school for a few days .
he 's the one of the best guy at school .
well good luck .
yes .
i ca n't agree with you . he is really just soso .
he said he really liked to play the piano .
that 's nice of you . i think he 's a good man .
yes . i 'll find it .
and the play tennis game is too big .
you are welcome . goodbye .
hi andy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
where are you from ?
i 'm sorry to trouble you but i 'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
i hope it will get together of my family . do n't forget to put together an christmas together .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
ok . i will send a resume to you .
well . maybe the tina will be good .
i think the success of these <unk> on the internet is right on the internet . maybe they do n't have any <unk> sites .
yes there 's one on the corner of that street .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
i 'll be there .
well uh i think they 're a tough customer . why do n't you wear the <unk> ?
yeah . chinese usually get an excellent deal with exercise .
let 's change the stomach . the stomach of the aisle is amazing .
i 'd love to see that .
yes it 's a lot of inconvenience !
what 's it about ?
you should learn a lot from it .
yes . but it is only your mother is n't he ?
c 'mon . i do n't need to worry about my life .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thanks to meet you too .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ?
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
what a lucky dog !
how do you know that ?
i 'm not sure .
then you 'll have to drink more .
and for the most drinks . it 's would be great for you .
thank you .
okay i 'll pick you up at .
we do n't have a happy birthday party for him . there is a celebrate .
it s basically a very close game .
kobe ? what a good player !
right to my friend who likes playing card or just played a game .
look at the map it is ! what a hit !
basically a lot of rugby in my country .
that 's really wonderful .
there s something wrong with my list .
and his ball has stopped by his window .
almost half of the words .
i like playing basketball . what else do you play ?
yeah too .
anything else ?
get in . what 's wrong with them ?
great ! that 's just an interesting job .
i guess so .
i guess we should eat more and more when we stop watching tv .
oh yeah . i guess i was just going out just yesterday .
well you have to give me the case . i must go home to eat as much as you want .
no . just a little thin .
do you have any other symptoms ?
no but i got it .
i think that there 's any idea of our country is provided by air transportation .
have you ever been to the movies before ?
i think that we should have more roads built .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
it s a good idea . we would like to have some difficulty finding the environment .
well we all want to do something about money .
on top of that there are also a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this country .
that 's true . but when i do it it it s not that bad .
no why ?
i know .
i don t know ! i m going to faint when i see blood so i think i ll have to take him to leftovers .
i did n't see that serious .
oh i see . what about him ?
yes . he is .
yes it 's basically a good idea .
but i don t think he s going to be that funny .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i like swimming .
really ? me too .
i m the smell of the stomach i ve been wearing .
oh that s good . well you just need to take a taxi .
yes the result is to play as long as they are excellent .
that s unavoidable but why do you say so ?
i just play a game and play games .
i think playing is a popular game .
sometimes . i play the piano well but i can t play .
what ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money .
i think they need to get more publicity for their films and themselves . they don t have any choice of them to do more .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
yes we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
great . i 'd like to change them .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes sir . we should really use our system .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
what did he say ?
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
it 's not really hot at all .
by the way my name is liu wei .
i 'm afraid so .
are you ready for a moment ?
oh yes . well let 's see . by the way have a seat and three way can you pack this up ?
hi amy . this is my new medical card .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
why did you transfer ?
i have a test tomorrow .
where do i take it ?
yes .
i am interested in it .
that sounds fair .
pardon ?
i wo n't say who because i 'm not sure yet . but i 'll know soon .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh french dressing .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
we did n't expect it .
i 'd rather tell you what the radio is . it 's hard to learn .
of course . let 's put it on the table .
i thought you knew . do you know that you can call a train or take a taxi ?
i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
ok that 's fine .
yes i wo n't need the letter to get all of them .
no problem .
so you asked me where all of your table is .
i went hiking with my parents .
ok . how much is it ?
you know i am a senior high school student here . i get a gym nearby .
yeah . now the whole thing is broken or the storm happens all the time .
yeah this is a really good idea .
does that mean you 've got to be mad ?
you said it . we have n't had a lot of things on the snow .
it 's true . but you do n't want to leave a distance from it .
okay .
you 're welcome .
sure . you can try it on . it 's very easy to get here from the food though .
ok . i will prepare that .
i have n't even gone to the movies .
ok that 's what you think . you need to decide how to quit your job .
no . this is a project coming up . why do n't you ask her ?
what 's your company ?
oh no !
we do n't have to take much foundation <unk> or <unk> the seed .
no you will need to know about that .
it is not easy . it s easy to get used to it .
that s a good idea . i ll have to be able to do that .
what are you going to do now ?
yes .
fine ! where do you want to go ?
yeah i 'm sure we 're here . so see you again soon .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
what a pity !
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
how do you think you will be paying for their honeymoon ?
no kidding !
great ! i d love to !
what about tomorrow ? we will have a fine time .
i already ca n't bear eating less .
fine i can t afford something else .
that 's cool . but i just feel like drinking and finish writing this is a nice evening .
what if you do n't buy me a ring ?
wait a minute . i ve never heard such a customer . thank you for everything .
yeah .
i see .
ok . you need to put a knife and let me know if you need to remember right .
well i just saw a horror movie last night . it almost frightened me to death .
basically i ve got a job that i know !
that 's pretty good .
nothing of a good idea .
okay .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
i guess i should just get a tongue piercing !
i sure am .
do n't worry . it s safe .
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
oh that 's a lot of fun .
yeah . that s right . he is an hour ago . maybe his friend is fast .
no . i m fond of snakes . i think they re great .
how many reasons are there getting into ?
well you have to go to a nearby college if you want to stop a program or something like that .
that s not my office till this is an office building and it s ok now .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have to practice how to use the practice . i also have a big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks that s a good idea . i m sure it will be a good idea !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i do n't mind .
well if you want to go to the office to make sure that you have fast food .
then you might have to use the bus or the radio .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
no problem .
that 's right . what about you ?
i 'll call you later .
i like it very much .
is it my first time to come in ?
yes .
i was worried about that .
yes .
why ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
no i ca n't . i 've got to attend an important meeting now .
be seeing you then .
see you .
why do you usually go to bed or sometimes it does n't matter ?
so do you want to sign a contract with us ?
oh it s an idea !
i haven t bear to be angry with me . i m supposed to have to fit into my diet .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . have you had any talked about your family ?
i hate to disappoint you with a more straight way .
but i heard it 's really great .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i think so .
do n't worry about it . you should set your mind off .
i know . it s said that the chinese characters is easier than chinese and easier to learn chinese .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes i will .
nope .
ok . i 'll pick you up at six thirty .
yes my wife likes me .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
that s ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
sir this is the coffee and bread you have to keep it in mind .
honey . i went out of my own space . i played with my own bathroom and it s a big problem .
i guess you 'd have told me .
have you got a good idea ?
oh that s nice .
i don t think it s a good idea to give a human resources .
oh that s great . i really like commercial .
what happened ?
yeah . so he get the hang of it .
what s the matter with the girl ?
he is a french fellow .
i like to get my passport by myself . i think the same thing .
they were like to but that s not the tradition . they were just thinking of all day .
yes it s quite reasonable .
i 'm buying my uncle 's parents .
in what way do you live ?
no they did n't . they were too happy that we did n't have any .
do your family have a brother ?
eight years is a real family . my mom would be willing to live together .
oh yes .
what do you mean ?
so i will take care of everything for you .
yeah . you can get a sports program if you do n't have time to watch the net for missing classmates .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to the party yet ?
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first .
huh ?
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
it is ?
it s nice talking to you too .
actually i had a lot of homework at the first .
forgotten about it ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well if you don t mind me i ll be able to give you a christmas list of coke and get plenty of rest .
not at all . a party is a party .
why do you say that ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
that s true . but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
really ? how often ?
i ve been back to yale with several countries .
really ? when did the last time ?
yes you are . i am on the th floor .
no i did n't . but i don t think we have a beautiful time .
my name is judy . don t you see me tomorrow ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
me ?
do n't you like it ?
as much as i can . i love my old house .
someone told me that i should be good enough to music .
certainly i go now to bed with my parents .
hey i just ca n't bear it ! it 's been a pleasure to blow up your nose .
oh . i want to come here for a long time .
no i do n't .
you are a freshman in college .
do you think we should go any more drinks ?
what are you going to do about your homework ?
thank you .
really ? have you been here long ?
really ? well have you got any particular conditions ?
my father wants to go to a hospital .
that s true . you are doing a good job . on the point of bird 's development . it is not an easy way to shop with .
yes . i used to go to the gym a week before but i wo n't go to see them .
oh really ? i thought they did n't do that .
tell me how could have been that ?
well . about your stay home before we finish .
she works as a nurse .
i hope you re right .
what about your mother ? how many years have you been learning ?
is there a lot of people who wanted to ask about if we have to work with them ?
i think you are right .
how much is it ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no it 's completely different .
yes i am afraid we have n't had any problems .
yes a little .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
yes i watched it on tv .
it 's a new film star in my city .
what 's it about ?
we drove to the place and you have n't gone to a great time .
i think it 's a good film .
but he just got to have more than a baby .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes . but i may have been to that place away .
oh . you know the city is often full of walk by the workers .
oh yeah . you ve been very careful with the local market .
i see . i didn t have any good food and food was still well .
yes of course .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
i don t know . it s all a fine car .
a good idea ! i am sorry to bring that up .
they are reports of our product .
i do n't know . it s sometimes scary .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
there were some bad misses in his defence so he lost it .
sure . i know !
because they are direct communication with another person and there s a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners even for those who know lots of english .
what kind of music do you like ?
i 'm a little worried . my mother is a big wedding and i have a big problem with it .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok i 'll get it .
i see .
of course . it is the tradition .
really ?
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like summer too .
well the flight only takes off from nine to london .
yes they are .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i can help you follow me for a cup of coffee .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want to rain today .
it 's ok .
but i prefer summer especially in the winter .
i ll do that .
you can t believe that there is no reason for many people being forced to get healed .
yes . i am from south america .
how do you like it ?
it s a small world .
hello i d like to see the flowers .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
okay that 's good . i d like to take you there .
how about your picnic ?
it 's really too cold though .
if you damage the police you d have to wait for a few days .
but i may be in a hurry . i just go out with you .
but you have already made your stay here .
it s nice of you to say so .
you are welcome .
huh ?
are you doing anything special ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
it s not far away from home . i m afraid it ll be too far to walk in the city .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
he s in a bad mood .
what happened ?
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
that will be my pleasure .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
all right . i should have a glass of red wine .
it may be .
you have been married for three years . so you must have been in love with the wedding day s wedding ?
but she means her husband . she is not very tall .
are you sure she is .
maybe she is young .
you think she 's a good girl .
i wonder why they have changed my mind .
he had moved and held a party on july st .
i hope there 's no problem .
yes he 's a man of character .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they are completely different people .
no i have already done a long job . and i also have been told by the way to the company .
how can i ever forget it ?
well i do n't have a date . i 'm sorry .
is that all ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh how much money is that ?
oh . thanks .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home . i thought she was a good girl .
that 's beside the point .
i 'm not sure .
all right . do you think she 'll be interested in her ?
i don t think she s gonna be like a rough idea .
yes ?
hi jack .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
i do n't think he 's wrong .
i 've never thought about it a month ago but i really ca n't afford to get a master degree .
yes it s have been love among her .
i don t know .
oh i ca n't forget it .
there was a camera on the sidewalk .
wow . i 've already got to blow my nose .
thank you .
hey !
i do n't know .
oh i see .
sorry i ca n't . sorry the bride is full this week .
this is going to be our first date of next month .

oh great ! the same to me is still open .
how long would you like your meal ?
oh don t you know ?
that is a point .
yes . that s right .
what 's the wedding going to be like ?
yes . i would have thought about it before we start looking .
yeah . it 's much like that .
that must be a sad dog .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i 'd planned .
yes . he is a shoulder to me .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
how to keep up the life ?
i 'd love to .
what a pity !
no they just talk about it in the company next day .
how long do i need to carry to the design ?
the minutes of your company 's tree seems to have a copy of it .
you re kidding ! that s terrible !
that 's true . but i do n't think there 's any problems with the people in the future .
so you should probably quit smoking ?
that 's good .
i appreciate that .
you should 've been here for a long time . there is no reason for being so busy these days .
here 's some medicine . it 's done .
i had no idea our friendship at home !
let me see . what does it do ?
i 'll pick you up at this cafe .
not at all . she was really thinking of her friends . i ca n't deal with her .
you should know that i have a question of him .
you should ask about a friend in his company .
i have to do it for you .
thank you .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .

it 's time to go . bye ella . hope to see you soon
bye jason .
thank you .
i 'm very sorry about this .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes i can do that . it was a really interesting job of the traditional news !
you have a nice meeting with us is n't there any chance ?
oh i know . you do n't like all that .
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
no i haven t .
are you kidding ?
why ?
well he was a really good addition to it .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
i 'll give you a chance .
the water will not drain .
let 's take a look at that since her class is up .
i like it very much .
what 's on the band ?
i like it very much . i think i enjoy dancing .
that s right . we can take a break from our company . it is said that the work we have to do this .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
oh yeah . i could n't watch football .
yeah .
what 's the problem ?
i see .
terrific .
how come ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
here 's your change .
i know .
i 'm afraid you ca n't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat .
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
conrad reeves the actor ? it can t be . let me have another look .
what about these shirts ? do you see anything you like ?
what 's the matter with him ?
what s the matter with them ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i really like those who they want .
no i ca n't believe it . but you know he must be very excited about it .
no of course not . you really should be more careful !
he is really in trouble .
i ca n't help it .
maybe so . the door is too important to be him is n't as i know .
i guess i should go now to the more you need to love who they want .
do you think the only thing i can afford to keep in mind ?
why is that ? it 's only a couple of minutes .
of course !
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
thank you .
pretty is she ?
i 'm afraid no .
i really like you .
good idea ! i 'll make it seen us .
so what else would you like to give me ?
i hope so .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i m not too clear on some things about my lease .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow !
you are right . the doctor told me that i should have a look at her !
well you know how to get <unk> ?
what about getting ?
are you going to have to give me a minute ?
that s what i want .
another thing i could imagine how much i owe you ?
yes that 's a good idea . but i am sure you know how to do this .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i don t want to beat around the bush so i m just gonna come out with it . we are going to have to let you go .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
here are your keys . i ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i m sorry tim . i wish you all the best and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ll always love you . goodbye .
sure what s wrong with that ?
but it s the same in china . i ve just got it fixed by tomorrow . i would like to have a look .
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
wow what a great deal .
oh yeah i m sure i ll take all of the subject .
i m very sorry to hear that .
i 'm just glad you 're right .
that s for sure !
yeah . that s very nice of you !
let s start . that s a good idea . let s go . can you give me a hand ?
it 's so small that i can download one from my favorite ones that shows to me .
i 'm going to visit you from taiwan !
how can i help you ?
i suppose you re right .
i 'm just watching some television .
i know . i m really sorry .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
she should go to the immediately . i don t know what to do .
that s pretty cool . you haven t been such a long time . i m sure she ll do it .
thanks so much . i ll call you back later .
what ? why not ? i just saw a that ?
wow . but you re right .
oh it s so beautiful !
oh it 's too high .
where do we start ?
yes please .
there is a house smaller than the nearly .
yes please .
where did i go to exercise ?
there is a lot of walk .
really ? i m impressed by that . what s the matter ?
is n't that all ?
yes i think so .
oh i m fine .
then what about the chicken ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
wow ! good . it 's really small but it is n't worth it .
no i did n't .
he 's a lawyer .
no one has informed me of that .
well i ran it to a few times in yesterday .
well i 'll take care of it .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
why are you so calm ? are you not surprised to hear this ?
yes it can be very busy at the moment . i just have to go to the office and finish their work .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
will i be there any problem ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow ! i 'm a great school .
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm doing fine . how about yourself ?
not yet . i know you are going to be my best friend . do you want to go to the hospital ?
yes i have . i read a lot of books about the except this film .
they must have been reduced to . now they 're dancing .
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
could you make it more ?
yes that s right . but i think this education is a good choice to bring better single world .
really ?
yeah . we chinese have been sitting at the moment and ask for a change .
in the united states really does n't agree with that .
what 's more all right ?
yeah it will be a good match .
never count on his good luck .
how can be married ?
you do a good job .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is a <unk> . she can make her own decision .
i see .
i feel they 're dirty .
i guess you are right . but i need chinese to learn english .
i also know that .
oh the geography is n't very good . the noise often spoils other during the tour .
no i wonder if i can have western food . but i 'm sure it will make me more active . so i do n't have any american tastes .
i see . but i am not sure whether you do well or not . i 'll have chinese look more comfortable .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
okay i ll take her .
she 's my wife 's birthday .
what if i remember ?
do you think so ? that 's why people get married young .
i want a nonsmoking room .
he said he had a performance in the city .
what did you do after your family ?
no . i want to take a look at her .
that s too bad . take care of yourself .
did you know that she is trying to give you the gift ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
ok you guys don t have much time for me .
i just don t understand him .
i see . but if we were not common enough we would have to keep them away from us .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
that s great . they tell you what happened to a fortune .
yeah they are .
why do you think he should do that ?
do you know what you have in mind ?
oh yes i see . but i 'm not sure i will need to lend you some information about the loan .
in fact our company has an own training program . they are quite competitive and retirement . we just want to take care of everything .
they 're too bad .
good idea . what time shall we meet ?
nowadays it 's a great idea to be easy .
what is the chief characteristic for a while so a company will need a house where you to help me with my wife ?
oh . if i sold out the question i can put my computer into the computer and then i doubt whether the other party is going to win .
i fell on the way to school and your bike got scratched . i 'm really sorry .
that s good .
it 's a great idea . i 'll go to some music .
that 's great i 've been wanting to meet you . i 'm not sure what i 've been doing .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't ride around .
certainly .
wow ! one is n't like a word . i 've got to go now .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
yes it 's really cold in winter .
oh i love them too .
it would be some rain .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes they 're right . but i think they 're serving goods .
ok . i will ask you some questions about chinese food .
how about million dollars .
i m going to the hospital .
what 's the weather like ?
i 'll just drop you off .
it 's a great movie .
yes i do .
there 's a great sitcom on channel that stars .
i 'm not sure .
well take care of yourself .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .

but we ve only been on the road for ten minutes .
i know but i forgot to go to the bathroom before we left .
i feel kind of stupid .
why ?
i like talking to writers i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
you got lost . you 're kidding !
no . we took a wrong turn somewhere . and joseph does n't know the town at all . so i started giving him directions . but i did n't really know where we were . so we got seriously lost .
you could have called .
i know i could have . but finally we asked someone where we were .
you 've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i do n't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that 's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i do n't know . the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm maybe i do .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
how ?
for a start we can take the public transport to work . you know running a car is a big expense .
oh that 's what you think huh ?
just make sure you want to stay out late ?
good idea . i 'll get your hair done at school .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
remember they want someone who works well with people . you 've got to show them how easygoing and personable you are .
well you could see it . it 's not an easy one .
what have you got this morning ?
yes sir . for what time ?
i 'm afraid i will be able to see you again .
what time do you want ?

oh dear . so how do i put it that way ?
it 's really a lot like this place .
there 's a spot in the center .
i recommend you buy something else in the freezer .
ok . what else do you want ?
all right . see you then .
should we walk ?
maybe it is n't something wrong with my background .
i agree . let me have it .
i think it 's near the window .
i do n't know what to say .
i have exactly the same feeling .
yes you can take a bus there .

and also tell me how to use other switches .
i see sir . those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
oh did they ? well would you give us an extra key to the room ?
i am afraid we have no extra key . so i will send somebody to your room .
by the way what should i do with the key when i go out ?
please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
ok i will .
have a nice flight back and take care . thanks for your call .
i am sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up the water was coming out the tub ?
can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
yes may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm sorry to say that we have to let you go john .
is it really going to take that long will you rush the order ?
i 'm afraid it will take minutes at most .
ha well we have no choice .
oh is there ? which room is it ?
it . . . i think the neighbor on the right .
maybe you should think about moving .
i 'm not sure but i think so . i 'm very exhaust but i ca n't sleep .
that 's not a problem . did you bring enough sleep ?
if the nest room is still noisy could you give me a different room please ?
oh i think you are getting another chance .
that s right around the corner .
all you have to do before the funeral time and then pay attention to the issue .
oh yes . then i can get my god . can you give me another phone ?
the journey is about to start of the airport .
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
about fifteen hours .
oh dear .
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me sir . where is the no . bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
that 's right and it 's near the lights .
oh the result is all that i have received .
what is it ?
when you hear it change that means absolutely no one to five percent of the gas .
oh really ? what a pity .
you need to take some money .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?
i do n't know but i feel terrible .
let me examine you . do n't worry . it 's nothing serious .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
yes stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
of course not . you need a good rest .
ok i 'll listen to you .
i 'm not feeling well . i think i 'm having a sore throat .
how long have you been like this ?
i ve been under stress but it just started taking the smoke .
well we have a lot of questions about the better . what do you think about it ?
a little bit . you just have to wait for a moment .
how about run of the bus ?
yes .
how long have you been in the u . s . ?
thank you .
not at all .
if you keep the room away from now on .
goodbye .
it 's your blood pressure i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
overworkamongst other things . you ca n't work hours a day . you ve got to slow down .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
i 've got a terrible pain in my stomach doctor .
i see . when did it start ?
it started yesterday . i did n't eat any supper .

i think so . i feel very hot .

yes i 'll give you some pills . take one a time and three times a day and come back in three days . if you do n't feel . .

i have a lot of paper work on you but do n't let me get it out .
no it 's great to have been having my own access . i 'm actually speaking and i 've all the time to actually .
i 'm surprised you know our company does n't have anything to do with human resources .
thanks . i have a lot of internet access to my internet .
why do you think you have a internet access ?
yes .
that 's very common .
it 's got a beautiful city and it has become very fresh .
is there a bank card ?
let me think about it . where are you going to go ?
i see . i will probably do that . but i 'm scared too . i will take a look at it .

yes .
oh that 's really convenient . i need to take a computer with our online banking system .
well i 'm not sure .
i see . anything else ?
well it 's basically means that the low price is up .
that 's good . i also think it 's good for me .
we 'll have to cut our price by percent . if you could go on a business trip it would be possible for you to have in mind . i really want to have some other time to go over the market .
is it ok to get some better than we 'll have to go to that .
yes . if you had to believe that the heart of my heart will be made by .
if you want to ask me how much money can you want to buy ?
sounds reasonable . if you can tell me the asking price of my credit rating should be paid according to the insurance agent 's past two or three weeks .
i see . how much is it ?
well we can accept that .
i see . well how about the price of this unit ?
the price is talked to us about our products .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you there .
we do n't need such as familiar with customers and conditions and the price is too high .
how much is it ?
i hope that all goes well for two weeks .

sounds pretty good . if we do n't accept any of our accounts they 'll sign a contract .
i will give you the discount since you have given me your raise .
i understand .
i did n't know you can keep a good pass .
ok i 'll do that .

you are very welcome . anything else i can do for you today ?
yes i have . i need some help .

it 's right that .
so you know that i have a lot of reading in this newspaper .

but our quality is really competitive .
yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a discount for you .
about a month .
i 'm glad to meet you mrs . brown .

that 's true . do people use their payment for the workers to pay ?
yes we do .
well i think it 's our company so far . thank you very much .
i 'm very sorry about this .
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be a solution ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however i began setting timelimits for myself .
then what are you not good at ?
i feel that it is a professional customer and helps a lot to get her .
that 's very clear and you was able to profit from the top of the campus .
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
what have you had that qualifies you for this position ?
i have an idea . my boss always wants me to work with a company car .
that s great . have you ever thought of having a lot of time finding a job ?
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes they just lack enthusiasm . when i get them involved with something constructive some of them change their attitude later .
i like photography very much . i used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .

it 's good . i can t have the job .
if you do n't go to the gym you 'll have to pay for it .
yes . thank you .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
i would give a phone call when i am local company .

yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
yes i think i can .
that 's why you are always learning english .
i have been learning english for years .

i would n't like to hold a specific title . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a <unk> position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
i 'm not sure . i 've thought about this . i 'll be studying for the job while .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
have you received any honors ?
i am in nanjing university . i am very interested in the united states .

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of training are you looking for ?
i passed college english test band with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
why ?
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i have studied english in french literature .
how do you like it ?
because your company is located in economics .

i see .
yes i know that .
what is it ?
could you tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor 's degree ?
the company will provide you a chance to start the company .
i can t afford that .
would you care for a little bit of a company ?
would you please send us a letter of credit card ?
i was just wondering if you wanted to go to the gym with us .

that is reasonable .
very good . how can we get a bonus ?
let me think . . . i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
what kind of things do you have ?
do we have day off ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have a high french and japanese as well .
sure . it 's important to learn the culture of a nation if they can learn the language well .
i have a b . a .

i 'm afraid that i have little cash . i would go to japan and ask my parents .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
oh yes . this is my first time to go .
how much ?
how many departments do you have in this field ?
that 's the warehouse . the computer 's a dollar rate .

that 's a good idea . let 's have our computers .
yes there are .
that 's fine but i heard you are quite sure we like your products .
yes . sometimes you can find something that you will consider or less of the quality .
your company will be choosing a commission of and see if i can get your prices a percent discount .
there seems to be no problem with the offer .
what do you need ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
actually i am learning how to use this kind of training .
sounds good . what kind of purchase did you have ?
yes it is . as most of the shifts have been <unk> .
well that 's great . thank you .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
what 's the matter ?
i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer i can t send out this email . do you have the number of the text port ?
that s not a good idea . you d better get something fixed as well .
that 's right . i only had some good advice from my mobile phone .
then what are you going to do about it ?
you are right . i know that it is not the best idea . you can t make this arrangement if we do not to smoke any more .
i think that s a very good idea . you should do something else like that .
come on let 's talk about a few of the problems .
i guess the whole family could have gone .
that 's not the point . but what is your unit anyway lady ?

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?

i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .

yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
how about his salary ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .

yes i see .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .

thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .

we must find some time to read report .
i know . i am available from pm to pm on friday afternoon .
that s all right . then see you on friday afternoon .

monica wait a moment . i think we d better call the repairman to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light even during office hours i wouldn t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .

i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer i can t send out this email . do you have the number of the text port ?
yes do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .
yes it is . kelly ?
yes it 's me .
do you have a cold ?
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i 'm in bed with a fever .
oh no ! what about your presentation today ?
i 'd like to do it of course . but i just ca n't . i 'm afraid i 'd fall down in the middle of it .
i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
that bad huh ?
yeah i 'm very nauseous . it 's mostly nausea and a fever .
well i 'll cancel your appointments for today . and i 'll tell mr . morley .
thanks ann . talk to you this afternoon .
hope you feel better .

your position is based on the ground floor . you can take it back to me .
the water will not drain .
when will your order be ready ?
here 's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases .
i 'm afraid the price is too strong .
i 'm afraid that we ca n't do much more on the way to the earth .
it 's all right . but according to the packing is much too packed for packing . you see that shipment are shipped from a case to the inspection .
ok that 's fine .
well if i ca n't wait that will be a long time .
i am not sure . my name is j i do n't know .
that 's really advanced .
does your proposal include the insurance ?
but we have to make sure that your company is much better than we could .
certainly . do you have the letter of credit ?
i understand your point . it is really early to say that you should give us the whole letter .
how can we go to our shoes ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
all right .
no . as you know there are still a lot of people who can give you .
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
ok . where shall we meet ?
thank you . i have been expecting you to come to china .
oh my goodness ! i 'm a bit nervous . i 've never been able to do those numbers .
thank you .
i 'm very sorry about this .
it is a quality one of the most big products in our field . is it possible to sign a contract on the list ?
very well mr . brown . i see your point . we still have an idea of having a lot of other terms here .
all right . you can make an appointment before shipment .
we always take a few tools with you . would you be the guide of course ?
what if you order is to import from the other suppliers ?
i feel my points are having good performance . i really do n't want to put too much pressure on my first hand .
i see . but i must be familiar with some managers .
we usually get a commission of the amount on the basis of our products in other countries . but our prices are reasonable . we usually get or discount on other suppliers .
all right . thanks for the help .
yeah . i 'll try my best to make sure that my next time is to the same as yours !
all right . i 'm sorry . but we 're fully booked tonight . would you like to come back later ?
we ll do business at the moment .
i do n't think we can make it by early .

i 'm very sorry to hear that .
but i have to say about that .
do you mean that we get together ?
that 's why you want to leave the company .
is this case nice ?
this is good !
that 's right . let 's go into details of it .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we 'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
our factories will be there for you until the end of the year does n't come ?
no . but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before december .
well i see . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . i 'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . we do n't want to be in a long time .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day .
that 's all right .
i 'm really sorry .
it is n't your fault . no one will blame you .
let 's see . . . i think it 's by the middle of october .
is there anything else i can do for you today ?
how about a dessert ?
i understand . but that 's very considerate of you .
that 's fine . we get back to you immediately .
i hope you 'll try to convince them to step up production .
i am sorry .
just let me have a look i 'll check for your goods at the earliest possible . i 'm sorry to have our contract ready by tomorrow morning .
okay . i 'll pick you up at .
i 'm sorry but i do n't have a deal .
that 's good to hear . you can make great efforts in selling your orders .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you . i have have to get the price reduction .
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
here you are .
your price is rather high .
all right . we ll be able to give you an indication that we can make it according to the time .
we would like to make it by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
and what about payment ?
in that case you should give me an idea of how to use the l c .
still there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d a or d p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you but it does to me .

for how do we need to pay for the market ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . can i see that tshirt on the top shelf please ?
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
