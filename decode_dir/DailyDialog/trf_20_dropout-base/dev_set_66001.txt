it feels good .
thank you .
the end of this month .
thank you .
no we do n't . it 's necessary for you to pay well .
ok . can i pay by a deposit ?
i am leaving at so i can t find my sweater .
and it 's a brick ?
i think so .
sure . cantonese food is lighter while shandong food is heavier and spicy .
no problem .
oh it 's too expensive . i just want something to wear .
it 's ok . give me your address .
what 's the price for this one ?
oh yes . thank you . please put down a deposit for them .
certainly madam . here is a restaurant . just leave it to the lab .
there are two choices . take the head to the booth .
how long is the ticket ?
i 'm going to cut myself on a bag .
i 'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry .
with this one here sir .
coffee only black coffee

that sounds really good .
yes i 'd like some coffee .
how would you like your coffee ?
yes . thank you very much .

i can take an idea of the susan industry . it would be very helpful with that .
where 's the new girl ?
i ca n't help it .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate do n't you ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you ca n't stop drinking soda try
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
tell me what i catch .

no i do n't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's about a little order . i 'll just be able to find a scarf with a bracelet .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .

yep . here it is . what do you think ?

what 's your uncle do ?
that 's true . i really appreciate you for being a little worried .
what 's this ?
yes there is . it 's really worth visiting .
i think you are really pleased with the positive quality .
i want to try on this pair .
the round shape pair ?
that 's right .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
i agree how much ?
you will have to take a second look at the positive ones .
sure but i do n't drink much . so i do n't know what to order .
so how about an <unk> ?
it sounds good . i 'd like to start with a compare .
stirred or shaken ?

ok . how about the chicken ?
please give me a piece of pie first .
hmm i hate brunch .
oh yes . the balance is for rib . you can also base the amount in the original packaging and the amount to be delivered before you leave the body .
blah . . . what 's that ? i 'm not sure about it .
that 's all right . i ll pay you back .
what do you mean by that ?
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
it really was the best .
i do n't think this restaurant is a beautiful piece of cake .
why do n't you do that ? i need some new clothes too .
i 'm not sure . several of the shops in china are a huge fan of animals .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
a time .
really ? i think we re very shy .
that 's great ! you need to prepare for them .
do n't you know when we get in ?
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
well i ll leave them here for you .
thank you for your compliment .
perhaps you could do that .
are you scared of anything ?
i 'm glad you 're satisfied with it .
why ?
may i know what you do ?
so then why do n't you drive it ?
who will be the best man ?
what is it ?
but the sort of things are changing and the house is a little tight .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
i have to work so it 's hard to keep up the company with my needs work .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
that 's true .
i can take a look at the top .
ok .
i am not sure . the train is faster and cheap . it will be hard to find a place to live .
yes in the united states are a must .
yes that 's true . you should keep your mind pet .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
well it 's really a long way to do food .
no that 's all .
she did n't mind that long . it sounds like you are not going to be home .
i 'll do my own laundry right now .
is she a teacher ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
only about twenty minutes .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hello . is there a bank service charge ?
is everything in the fridge leftovers ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
yeah it 's really good .
have you turned it on ?

are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
sure ! and it 's easy to find anything that you can buy at least of the shop !
i do n't know i 'm not sure . i just saw the dress and it 's too cheap .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
sure . let me see . . . it 's on the th floor and there is no problem .
no it 's easy . we 'll see you on the way to the real estate office .
i 'm afraid i do n't like it .
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .

about years .
does it look so nice ?
i bought it a lot in the store .
i know sweetie . just open wide . do n't talk .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i liked it . i thought it was scary .
what a strange headache !
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
are you interested in ?
that 's the most important thing .
yes why not ?
how much money do you want to transfer ?
could you deliver it tomorrow ?

of course if the service is not addressed by the company . the shipping time will be canceled .
we are very sorry for you . we will send a refund tomorrow morning .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
you can buy them either ripe or unripe . unripe ones are hard .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
your want to know about it in the flyer or check with the information .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . the seed ?
well we can both see each other after our guests .

well we just got in some mangoes .

can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
they are .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .

i must be argue . i hope he ll drive you to the hospital .
oh yeah . i 'm so sorry .
let s go .
i think something must be done .
the view of the lake is really quiet too .
how come ?
where are you going to find your bedroom set ?
i like to be a part of the world and the trouble of my life is beautiful and i m and i love a man .
it took me to the subway station .
have you checked the periodicals section yet ?
did you check on the tv ?
what 's the actual news about that ?
yes it is . that s what i want .
ah . i don t know how to get a hold of the highway .
where to ?
i want to go to the financial <unk> .
ok .
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
great idea !
that 's too bad .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
it 's yuan please .
oh i see .
thank you . have a nice day .
no i do n't .
where are you from ?
please put me in the ignition and close the car to the south .
here we are . could you please put it in a scale ?
but you should keep your mind off . i 'm afraid the radio does n't seem too good .
we offer the service for you .
here is dollars and change .
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
that 's an excellent idea .
here we are . thank you .
but you certainly do n't have a long history .
thank you .
hi my sweetheart . it s dad .
sure . how do you feel about this one ?
oh we are having a beautiful view for you . this is the best we can do .
yes i think so .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
no thanks . i 'd love to .
just a few minutes . i 'll see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be ok to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the city and the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i am much more interested in it .
hi steven !
hi linda . i have n't seen you for ages .
oh no . i 've been missing it a couple of days .
i 'm fine tom . and you ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month . so i am doing some research on them .
how have you been ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
i have no idea . sometimes i can do it myself .
yes i 'll see you then .
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working here for a year .
i see .
he 's very nice .
what is she ?
yeah the train is still sick . i 'm sorry .
that 's interesting . and i heard that it would be very expensive to do that .
what 's the difference ?
how many people are there in your party ?
i see .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
please show me your id card please .
all right i ll do what you think of the problems next step .
ok i can t . . . what are you doing ? you have a big favor !
which side is it ?
ok !
what do you know ? why do n't we get so many things ?
i ve never tried being into this game before .
what s the matter ?
i 'm looking for a sweater .
what color are you looking for ?
i think i d like a laptop . can i see a picture of you ?
all right . and anything of the camera ?
i see .
sure .
oh thank you . i do n't think i 'll go with it as quickly as possible .
so you re pretty interested in this job .
yeah the packed in san francisco is a nice day .
i d suggest you buy an inexpensive camera .
oh no ! sorry . i forgot what to do . .
i agree . i think it s very expensive .
what 's it look like lady ?
no i do n't . this is a gift for my girlfriend .
ok .
oh wait a minute . i m starving !
i am sorry . i just don t feel so good . what 's the matter ?
sure this is my paula .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
no that 's it . thanks .
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear .
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing the time . it s too dangerous .
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i know i know i know .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
yes i was .
what s wrong ? why don t we get all the presents !
alright . let s go then .
i really like the kitchen and it looks so cool . did you ever get a boyfriend ?
can you pick out a few years of the problems ?
sure but you 'd look so slender !
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there . it looks great don t you think ? i need a new pair .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . it will be dangerous .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
a good idea .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
maybe we could get a few furniture .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you . see you on the apartment .
and i d like to do some things for you .
the rent is per month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what is it ?
we offer a discount of of of the employees you will pay yuan for the members .
i will cancel your phone number and two weeks before publication .
how about a home inspection ?
i went to a movie with my boyfriend .
if you like i m afraid not .
yes i do it a lot . but i do n't like doing dishes . what about you do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
yeah it 's the same every year . i usually not have enough money to learn chinese people cook it for my own meal . i 'm sure they will be good .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly madam . do you have a reservation ?
which one is the best ?
that 's perfect . what 's the occasion ?
but you could get a point to such a large order .
i m sure you can do better than that . by the way do you want to get a steelstring or a radio ?
i m going to let you play so early .
sure . i m looking at the shop . let s go and get them for you . we can buy them for you .
i think that blue will be perfect .
what else would you like ?
i prefer a jacket .
wow this is our latest model . i can hardly see it on your business card .
i m going to take my shoes .
i am . he will be here later .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes it 's still on the internet .
i think that is a place to look at . maybe you should be quiet and comfortable in the apartment .
i ll take an apartment with you at .
all right . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i 'm just going to ask where you want to go .
do you see anything ahead of the controls in the car ?
thank you .
no . everything will be ready when you get your picture .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
yes . i will be there .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's pretty quiet here .
could you pick up a list of the exhibits and see what they like ?
i think you re right on the way to the keys .
i 'm sick of those things .
i think that 's water . it 's fantastic .
it looks nice . and the kitchen is so hot .
is the bathroom in the bathroom ?
right . let 's reserve a suite for our hotel . the price for the suite is .
oh that 's six of us . we have a cat and a dog and a cat .
what is it ?
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the road ?
why not ?
i don t think so . but i can only throw them in a piece of paper months .
that 's my favorite . it 's a fantastic winter show .
i love the beautiful lawn . what s the view from the beautiful scenery ?
i think that 's the best choice .
well there is a single room for you .
it s not very delicate and color .
hello . what can i do for you ?
hi there it is steven . what can i do for you ?
do you see it 's still available ?
i have a house with my parents .
here you are .
yes i 'm still in a position .
i have it urgent . i can send someone over to fix it .
we 'll have to make sure that your see you then .
we 're going to move a lot of the city when we 're in .
thank you .
no but we also need to check your passport .
i 'd like to buy a ticket to casablanca on flight us tomorrow .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
oops
yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
i agree with you but i 'm not sure of a local accent .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
what are they ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how long would you like your haircut today ?
yes he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for o 'clock .

where is the house now ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
yes i can do that .
is that why you ca n't buy it ?
yes the house is on the end of the town .
i hope it 's the life of the life .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
the commission is too high .
it 's really easy . it 's really very easy . and there 's a lot of people here in america . it 's a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
actually if you think about international money then it 's not about square kilometers .
no i ca n't . i am going to help my peter .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about cooking ?
i prefer chinese food .
yeah i like authentic chinese food .
yes . the food was not good enough to be here .
how much were you going to make ?
i like chinese food .
sounds art as a matter of fact i would n't think more about western food .
no i 'm still learning chinese now . but it 's my mother 's going to be a french photographer .
and you often have to try them too . if you don t eat them now you can t seem to have it too cold .
thanks .
absolutely . i 'm glad you like it .
all right .
let 's see . . . actually we have chinese food in taiwan . can you recommend some chinese food ?
i will show you where we know .
well i just want to get a fixed amount of money .
i know . i think we should get a few expensive issues for them .
i know . but we have to send someone here .
i ll just check for it .
alright . and what is your english name ?
where is your birthplace ?
can you tell me how to send it to a christmas tree ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i 'd rather tell you what 's the rate for a high order .
we need to know that . but we are superior to companies from japan .
i suggest we go .
they are the things that make up the atom such as electrons and protons .
what 's the price of online ?
yeah stop thinking about this game . it 's on your desk .
but how can i find the products ?
yes . we have a lot of good local services . and we also like a lot of good local idea .
what 's usually monthly output ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know . i have some parttime jobs .
that 's right .
i want to have a beautiful pair . i want to look at it .
the fee is cents a copy .
how long do you plan to take it ?
how about a dog ?
yes i 'd like to send this book to france .
do you have any of those black ones ?
i lost it .
good . i ll take one .
because i ca n't stand them .
and they 're expensive too .
do you have any of those a black leather bag ?
well i guess i was asking for leave .
well what about this one ?
that s good .
well i do n't like this . in fact i will take care of the credit card .
i do n't have any of those things on my face . do you have a picture of those in black ?
i understand . but we need to talk about the four o 'clock this afternoon .
i 'm afraid to be too rude . we would n't have any thing to worry about about your work .
here you are .
thank you . what 's the number ?
no thanks . i really do n't like to pay for it .
just go to the parking meter in the uk .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is it a long time to get there ?
anything else ?
where s that ?
it 's the tradition . . .
i guess you are right . the food is still too slow for me . do n't you think it 's a good idea to get food ?
what about some new leftovers ? how do you get all these things done ?
now what ?
how about the sun shines day ?
oh yes . i like them . they are excellent .
oh my parents used to be very happy when they moved in .
yes i can do that . but we need to cancel the price .
not really . i do it very much .
that 's it ! that s the best news ! you know it 's really worth trying to learn something !
i usually go to the supermarket a few times a week .
yeah you are right ! i m going to start eating better at lunch time ! not eat any more !
hey shop ! i 've always loved anything like it . but if i save money i 'll get a new price and i want to spend my time at home which i want to buy and get a lot of money .
that s a good idea . you ll find a classical music agency .
well i usually get up at night . you can get me a lot of dishes .
my favorite is active and hard to eat . i will try one of my best .
yes we have a great variety of animals here but there is japanese restaurant which you like best .
wow . i have a feeling this weekend .
i like spicy food too .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been learning japanese .
i always order a kind of vegetable .

mom i do n't know how to travel by myself .
it means there must be a lot of things wrong with the old mp .
yes . it is wonderful to have the local audience .
my bad but my whole face is the waited .
why do n't we go there and have a bus station ?
not bad . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
how about next time we meet again ?
i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no by bus .
you have your own vehicle ?
no . i used to have one though .
i 'd like to suggest you try anchor inn on seaside drive .
because i 'm going to miss my grades .
that 's good thinking .
we can get off this road and stop the car on the road .
what are you talking about ?
it 's no problem .
that won t be a problem ?
i think you did .
i can tell you what kind i like .
i 'm not sure but i think i 've got a wrong bus .
let 's go to see a bus .
i was there .
how could you miss it ?
i do n't get on a bus pass .
you seem to be in a hurry .
i 'm standing in the community .
really ? i hope it will be a good idea to be his farewell performance .
yes of course .
how is your taste ?
no i won t be able to join any of his friends .
do they do the same thing with the food ?
i only need to think about this .
yes i know that . it is not my fault .
do i ?
oh it 's a good idea . thanks a lot .
i was just hoping to get a checkup .
i 've been feeling a little under the weather .
the morning is easy to take a look at the airport . i think my brother is going to be taken a airport to his office .
i feel the same way .
take it easy !
what is it ? i mean it 's just a mistake .
all right i will explain it to you later . now scram .
but if i do n't pass me !
oh i hear that when you 're chinese food from the post office .
i was n't able to do it .
sure .
i hope to put you suitcase on the scale .
how do you know what the fundamental cost ?
how do i know about that ?
what can i do for you ?
i feel terrible . i 've got a headache and my stomach is killing me !
my brother is a married man . he is the best man in the company .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
you re not listening to me .
do you remember the girl in the world have been chatting with tom for a long time ?
you know he is an excellent student . but you do n't believe he will change his job .
i think i want to try a new style .
come on it 's only seven days .
of course i should study english . my mother is very good .
what did you do ? i hope you should n't lose anything .
yes i am . i 've been here this year .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
i will be back next monday .
i like word novels of early japanese .
what 's your favorite course in your english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
see you then .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
well how can i help you ?
i bought it one size up by mistake .
well let 's order some chinese food for lunch . you do n't know the same thing about american food .
good !
fine . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm living in a bad school . i 'm living here .
i 'm not at all keen on going to take a long time .
how much do you want to pay ?
do n't worry . bye !
see you .
i 'll do my best .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
really ? i 'm glad to hear that .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i was just a beginner . how about you ?
yes . they are here for almost three weeks .
of course i am .
maybe i 'm ok to see you at the airport .
i want to tell you that i 've put in my notice .
university ? which university should i take to ?
what should i do if i get to the library ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .

i 'll take care of it . thanks a lot .
i am sorry . there is no subway station in the corner .

how many kids do they have ?
can i have my book here ?
i want to go to egypt .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
won t you get lonely ?
well i 'm ok . and where is your family ?
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
my credit card ?
you can check out two books at a time .
my poor memory . my god is very good .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
i see . thank you very much for your help .
i need to see that .
i 'd like to have a look at the menu . do you have any ?
you 're welcome .
my name is jessica . what 's yours ?
i 'm rose .
nice to meet you too .
yes . and you know i 'm here to show you around .
can i get you ready ?
what 's the weather like in winter ?
well i come all the way around my clock . i do n't know how to do it .
do you like this town ?
i 'm really sorry . i thought you were n't happy about that .
i was just saying that i 'm really pleased .
is it a great chinese teacher ?
will you be able to make it ?
now look at it this way when we are going to get married ?
i would love to be happy to . i would n't be happy to offer you up a wonderful time .
i hope so do n't forget to miss the show .
no . why ?
oh that s sorry .
i have a driver 's course .
the kind of trouble is coming up . try to have a look at the computer .
it 's a popular tourist economy one .
i 'm so sorry .
i 'm going to register three weeks ago .

in the gym i would go to a trust game for myself ! you have to teach me the whole life of the world !
did they do ?
no he s too old to be such a thing .
he said you are a workaholic .
well i was just wondering if you could go to my family with me .
then what 's the matter ?
i took a parttime job last year .
can you speak in other languages except for other languages ?
i am not the only person who can speak english .
well i do n't understand why you 're trying to deserve that ?
not yet . i was in the shape . i 'm doing well in the shape .
that 's pretty much like it .
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
did you guys go on a date already ?
how can i know that ?
i do n't know you did n't think that much about it .
it 's not the material yet .
oh my god . i just did n't know .
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
was it a good game ?
i twenty years of it .
it was nice of you to make a walk now .
because it does n't cost you much .
that 's a good idea .
i think i caught a cold .
have you been working too hard ?
oh do i ?
hi .
are you even drinking ?
i traveled and europe .
i learned to be patient when i was in primary school .
that 's good .
no i 'm just living now .
what 's your major ?
yes .
really ? how did you know that ?
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
wow . and what about your salary ?
i know . it sounds like a little customers but my mother is a little worried .
i see . have you ever got a chance of promotion yet ?
my wife and i ll take her home for only a half a year .
well to be honest you 're not a big drinker .
that 's pretty much when i 'm sick .
i already have a car .
but when you hear it only thing .
i was n't able to do that .
that 's not true .
i am not sure .
oh i see . thanks for that .
it 's my favorite teacher .
ok that sounds like a good idea .
yes he 'll be fine .
yeah that 's not fair .
do n't mention it .
no i have n't .
not that long ago .
i guess it is a bad idea . i also want to have a doctor s chest and it should give you a advice .
i agree with you .
he told me that he 's a worker like yes .
he should n't be a bit easy !
no . he s not the time .
i know . you mean i could n't seem to be able to learn english anymore .
ok . i ll go get a sheet here .
i need it . thank you .
i want to go to egypt .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .

oh is that right ? you are travelling around asia . do you know any of the pavilion over there ?
no it is n't .

nothing special . i had a gettogether with some schoolmates at the high school visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
you know i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
i am worried .

i want to speak to you about this year s election .
oh is that all ?
i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to be a professor in the future . i ve always been interested in studying literature .
i d be glad to do it .
have you heard about the olympics ?
maybe we should keep on line with the road .
what ? what 's the matter ?
i think you re right . i ll improve what i mean .
what ? i said we wanted to talk about it .
that s good idea . what do we do ?
i think i m ready to learn a lot from this job .
you 're right . it sounds like an idiot .
very well .
no problem .
i need to get a passport .
i m looking for this book .
do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that .
i ll show you where to find your article .
do you have a special brand in this library ?
i guess you have to take care of this job .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
the attraction for sure ! they don t see the name of media is becoming more powerful . it s definitely the same or committed !
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
now it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ?
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
actually many countries in the world are on the south of the world . there s some huge pavilion .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

that 's a great relief . i was worried about him .
the operation was very successful .
his parents must feel very happy .

but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? congratulations !
what are you talking about ?
well sounds interesting but how do you know his fan of his novels ?
that would definitely make a clear one .
it does n't matter . we are on the cut .
are you kidding me ?
yeah .
there 's a lot of evidence that you are in love with what we need .
we have a deal of learning some chinese folk songs this year . they are very good .
i bought it in the macy 's orange juice .
i 'm ok whatever you want .

i won t be able to make sure .
you should try to lose weight .

what 's her last name ?
i met her with her boyfriend .

she 's very nice .
you 're kidding ! that 's all i think we are going to ask her to come .
i feel sorry for a while .
when is her father ?
no . she said she was right to remain here in hospital for a few days .
well all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt e kids .
of course . he s been out of town .
maybe that 's wrong with it .
i guess it is n't that good .
i was sorry to hear that .
what 's that guy is going to look at ?
but if he is more important than you do .
can i try it on ? but you know i 'm just not surprised .
did you have to wait for the next test ?

i did n't know .
c 'mon . things are too safe to do .
yeah . the chairman said that the deadline was put in two days ago .
it 's not just that . you do n't have to type things .

i agree . i think we 'd better have been more fast .
someone plays to play a game in the game .

oh yes . and i had a lot of money with this .
really ? you 're so happy that she 's very happy with you .
whew . i am too happy to hear that .
the first meeting is around the corner . there 's nothing left .
i lost my arm .
who were there to be such a terrific couple of days ?
did you know that they were all popular ?
i really don t want to hear your excuses janet . we re running a busy office here .
no they did n't . the government could use a camera on it .
great ! i will go to the gym and get ready !
i 'm not sure . they must be particularly interested in studying in their life .
thank you so much !
what time will you meet me there ?
please wake me up at am .
of course ! let 's make it to the wedding .
yeah . that s right now . i am very busy these days . the flight takes off soon .
that 's really neat .
i said you wanted to attend class .
yep . i need to buy a new things and then make a list .
no wonder you 'll have a look at your carryon bag .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
oh i think i was better ! how could i get a better look ?
they 're beautiful . what 's the color ?
i 'm not sure yet .

yeah i guess so . i 'm lucky i left the job because my boss is a teacher .
no thank you . i 'll be all right back .
do n't mention it .
yes but you should n't give it any longer .
good morning .
good morning .
thank you . i think i 'm going to lose my job .
you seem to have a good relaxation . you can expect to be my best friend to handle my confidence in himself .
oh i 'm sorry david richton . but i forgot to tell you what i do .
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
and a storm blew our roof away .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
um . . . let me see now is it or i can never remember . . . . . . . next birthday . tthat 's it .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
great ! let 's go to a bar then .
good . let 's go now .
but i still have some time to go .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what 's the time ?
i just stayed in bed and watched the piano .
oh yes ?
of course .
i am looking for cologne small bottle . can i see that one in the glass shelf ?
i 'm sorry . that 's what i thought .
my computer wo n't turn on .
we are very sorry to hear that .
could you tell me something about the computer ?
how about your steak ?
what 's the charge for it ?
how about a cut then ?
quite well i 'm interested in it .
my pleasure .
ok . thank you .
ok . will that be all right ?
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
actually you have n't had much .
we will have tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
perhaps you have made a big buy at it . looks expensive .
yes i do .
thank you . what 's your occupation mr . smith ?
that doesn t bother .
sure . you can exchange this receipt to the money in your receipt .
it 's too large . but i do n't think it 's worth it .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
do n't worry about it .
oh dear .
thanks .
do you know what other advantages to get to food ?
does it always close at six ?
yes everything will be ready . i 'll do it for you .
i am thinking about visiting my girlfriend .
don t worry . i m getting money until i hit the money .
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing thanks .
i m just taking a break .
where do you want to go ?
oh . by the way i 'd like to take some photos .
we received the first gold from a market .
honey it 's not fair . the limbs are rusty now .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
how long do you think it s going to take ?
oh no ! that sounds great !
excuse me . are we going to a walk to the green house ?
i see . my friend in the meantime i did n't know that .
i hope so .
why do n't you just go and look for a basketball game ?
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> to how many children can move on to your strategy
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t take the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
who was trying to beat ?
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i am sorry . i have nothing .
of course i do . but i used to be a <unk> like this .
well i think the paper is a good idea .
be patient . if something terrible happened we should do something .
i think you look a bit tired . let s get a brain surgery .
come on you 're right . i just want to bear your mind !
do you think you are going to talk to me about it ?
really ?
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i have a big date tonight .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that .
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i know that 's true but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they will tell you when it is due to the party .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
that s a great idea . it sounds like you are not a good learner . i will be working in a company .
what 's up ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
no i have n't . i 'm so nervous .
how long will it take you to wait for a month ?
yes i enjoyed my stay very much . i worked very hard .
i think i 'm glad i could say it .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
why do n't you run and see a show of the sink ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
what ?

i have had a low fever these days .

but it will be hard to say .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . .
i hope my husband will help me .

you could use a credit card or your id card .
i 'll take the look at the map .

but i am not sure . when will i get another ticket ?
i 'm under the couch .
let 's give her a hand .
ms . stevens is sure to hear from you .

no joke !
i 'm not really interested in it .
i agree . those are played really fast . what are those of chinese sport ?
that that 's the one that you see . those are the ones that are wearing .
i get it . i guess the competition will go out more to my country than just now .
i 'd like to see that . you 're a lifesaver .
it s a piece of cake .
of course not . i would n't be able to make cold turkey overnight .
no . why ?
i 've got a single room .
i like spring because it 's always nice .
that s right . it s probably less exciting than bad as you are expected .
. . and what do you think about it ?
is it the same in fact ?
who is the best teacher ?
what color do you like ?
what 're the problem ?
then it 's not fair .
i will .
actually i only had a few coffees while i was in the singer . i learned a lot .
well it s not all that great news . we ll teach you how to play .
they might actually win the game .
well we have all the same questions .
yes .
that s good . how much should i keep ?
i was there .
i know . the game is really worth .
well i am very surprised you knew so much about this new job .
thank you for your help .
we were all pretty sick .
he has the final record yet .
to tell you the truth i 'm the best man .
but look at the girls in the dance floor . they certainly refresh my mind .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
right . i only knew a few english sentences .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
oh no ! he 's a cheater . i 'm sure he 'll pass his card .
what ? are you sure of it ?
we have two tickets .
i was wondering when you saw the author 's title . . .
you can pick it up in half an hour .
if it is any good i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
the internet is small for a single person who got murdered because the information about the vacancy on the internet is in the newspaper .
she 's a nice working relationship but there is still a lot of new people . you can ask questions about your sales .
what about your boss ?
i agree . he has lots of questions .
how ay years have you been working with him ?
well i think we should just meet here then .
merry christmas jina .
the same to you !
we can make a special order of easter eggs and then paint some designs on them .
i do n't know what to buy . if you want to buy something tomorrow i 'll leave you then .
i 'd love to . but i 'm not myself today .
sorry i was busy then . but i might have to wait to see it .
well . . . um . . .
my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
is the news a little ?
what 's the color of her eyes ?
well i 'm not sure if she 's going to be the end of the month .
well it 's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
i can tell you what kind i like .
but i think she liked to see the movie .
thanks a lot . actually i heard that she s the title of a child .
the same to you joey .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
it 's so beautiful . wow it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
ok . people decorate their houses place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
it 's hard to say . i like the music . it 's too complicated .
i like the novels . it makes me very excited .
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
my favorite is diablo . it used to be really fantastic .
that 's a interesting books . do you like to keep any foreign languages ?
a letter of credit is a bank . do you want to know ?
i think the idea is now a great idea .
it 's fine with me . i 'll get it for you .
oh i see .
i do n't know . it looks like a lot of things on the streets .
i think it 's a very traditional marriage .
really ? i want to go too .
just two .
the first time he was late .
no doubt it .
how can you prove that ?
i certainly can . he s still very good at that he comes from the text .
yes it is .
have you been camping with friends ?
yes but the entire life of bees is a good clean water .
no . quite a lot of wife said she want to divorce with a fight .
ok thank you .
it is !
yeah . he is a hard worker . i have to learn to save money .
the same for me . anyway i have to admit it better than happy birthday .
i know what you mean . i ca n't believe it .
you are really believe in manmade instruments . the government could be played on another country .
then how about your sister ?
i ve thought about that idea .
are you a visitor ?
you have to put her on her own first day and then she 's the idea of her career .
sure .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
can you tell which team is better ?
they 're still fighting hard . let s wait and see .

what 's your name ?
ping .

i 'm from new orleans . what about you ?
the ukraine team took the lead by to at the end of the first half .
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
it does n't seem to be so easy .
no it 's the japanese team .
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
well their team work is well worth learning .
they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for .
if the phoenix beats the rocket it will enter the final .
no way if it still has .
i scalded on the black race and walked were were very good .
you have a pleasant stay .
it is true but our team won .

he 's diving for the gold .
nothing special . how about you ?
oh come on . i 'm going to the post office .
i 'm ok . the problem is my type .

i think that he 's better than paying a crime .
let 's hope it clears up .
are you kidding ? i ca n't believe it .
are you sure he was trying to get the right person ?
ok .
neither . the game ended in two all .
what is your date of birth ?
china beat brazil to .
why not ? i heard he was very happy with that .
oh you are fine .
no it 's true . the cable is still early .

he 's on my own .
on this occasion most people do .
oh they are playing the wedding march . here they come .

i am so happy for them .

yes i always cry at weddings .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .

i 'm going to be a volunteer for several months and i have to improve my english .

oh no . i 've been missing it a couple of days .
i 'm fine tom . and you ?
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month . so i am doing some research on them .
how have you been ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
i have no idea . sometimes i can do it myself .
yes i 'll see you then .
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working here for a year .
i see .
he 's very nice .
what is she ?
yeah the train is still sick . i 'm sorry .
that 's interesting . and i heard that it would be very expensive to do that .
what 's the difference ?
how many people are there in your party ?
i see .
i like to do the piano .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .
what ?
i like taking steroids to get a movie and the email address .
yes . i ve always likes indian and thai food so i ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . the same as those made me uneasy .
that sounds like a lot of money .
i love amy . . . i think i ve ever had a few coffees .
the radio is really charming and can be found when you come back and enjoy it .
surely it is . good for you to change your mind .
we broke up with a girlfriend .
i think that you must have a strong sense of humor .
he was in a meeting when i was a child .
yes i do .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
no . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
he 's got a promotion .
really ? what happened ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
and then why did n't you ask him to call the car ?
yeah . he was his first child .
really ? it is the way to clean it .
yeah they do .
what did you say ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
did n't he ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
what ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation .
how did he do ?
yes . you have two idea of the foreign language .
have you heard of music ? it 's a supposed to be great but i do n't know anyone else in the mood for a music .
ok ! i 'll listen to you later .
it 's out of his face .
absolutely .
it 's so convenient . if i 'm in a hurry and i 'll go in for a month and get some vanilla ice cream too slow .
it 's a good idea . i want to have a few tests to take them out but i 'm going to england for a minute now .
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions training them in speech and then asked me to answer a position .
can i help you with that ?
no . but i don t think her acting skills are a bit matched . what 's the matter ?
i did n't know .
i bet you were all the same .
yeah i 've never been . i 'm so nervous .
i heard that he had a lock of a week .
i 'm glad that he had a litter too much of the punch .
she was very intelligent .
it 's a pleasure ! so what are you going to do now ?
you 're welcome . and remember to use a gift for us .
i 'm sorry i 've made an appointment for this afternoon .
ok here is a promise !
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
i m so happy .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
there is n't you must have seen through .
wow . that 's really interesting .
it 's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet bai buyi of the tang dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much and watch the moon over the lake .
oh and what is the difference ?
no it 's not just the video .
it is really a good idea to do some research . i 'm sure you really helps a little with your hands .
i think you should do as many countries .
of course not . it seems that no one can match shakespeare in artistic talent .
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press <unk> and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
what 's the good idea ?
you must have rolled over something just now .
yes i see . take myself for example .
it 's just around the corner .
and do you have a lot of luggage ?
the party starts at .
good idea . i have a look at it is so beautiful .
what are you talking about ? let 's just go and get a drink .
by air .
a lot of people especially the street are beautiful .
how do they like this ?
thanks for stopping by .
thank you . you 're a surprise . i 'm not sure she would like it .
thank you . i bought it for you . it 's made of silk .
i love it ! you know i 've been expecting this for a long time . it is good .
but i am afraid i have booked a mistake .
oh sure . the festival is going to be on the fourth floor .
what will you have for christmas ?
who takes the dog out of the wedding ?
have you ever tried that before ?
they re doing well .
sounds fun . your garden is a year of good .
really ?
it 's too bad . so what will happen if it is n't too noisy ?
no you do n't have to pay for it .
that 's great . i want to enjoy the beautiful scenery .
we could share a room ! it would be fun . and we could do some traveling around the same city .
the competition is moving so we have to think about ready .
ok . maybe we can go and get some food .
leopard . it 's a famous one of the best known in america .
i know it but i did n't buy it .
that won t be too expensive .
what else does it include ?
yes . with the second digital memory l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
cool . anything else ?
then you 'll change the cup .
at o 'clock
yes they is but there is n't a wedding reception .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
thank you . i 'm very glad we will have a pleasant wedding .
sure .
oh the garden looks so beautiful . i am i .
well i know a lot about the state . but the state will benefit a lot .
it 's .
well it 's a big view . i 've heard that the set is covered with your city .
what can i do at the moment ?
if you need a roommate let me know . but if you need a roommate or to go to the student market to have the money you can take care of everything for .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
lucky .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
no wonder we 'll be here in the world sometime <unk> invitations which includes a lot of beautiful paintings and stuff .
i hope you voted for him .
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it was the best game ever .
that was the first thing that i did n't go . is that all this news ?
you have a big problem with your room .
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
i guess so .
yes i usually use a computer online to pick up a few you want .
that 's good . are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
your birthday is coming up . i will wait you to try out .
no thanks . how much is it ?
it really sounds great .
actually you have n't had much .
no thanks . i 'm full .
oh . i 'm afraid we ca n't . the time is bad .
look how lovely .
i think the government will cause a man in this way .
oh no . i 'm sorry . but i do n't really want to talk to new boss about it .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you buy a ticket for it ?
yeah i went to the movie last saturday .
really ? why did you ask her ?
yeah i 'm sorry .
have you changed any experience ?
i hope i do n't have to call another time .
come on .
well then the other day can be done .
i think you should introduce yourself first .
no . it 's all yours .
well i think i 'm going to go for an office . i was wondering if i could put you down for a transfer .
i 'm afraid not .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
waltz is my favorite .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
many people . i like girls who are the type of thing .
no i 'm not at all . i 'm just clever but you are not allowed to keep fit .
yes . listen music is a good place to dance .
then what 's the matter with her boyfriend ?
haha . . .
yes it is . the chinese folk songs from england is a wellknown public surveyor in china . so i think they all have had a chance to learn english .
i suppose the same is same with wiki .
generally speaking the special effects are higher than the others . for the host consideration the goods in the west is generally quite simpleto savor the wine .
understand .
we are in the mood for them . let 's take the lead again .
they 're designed to exclude them from domestic trade and japanese arts and crafts .
of course .
yes . i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot of different <unk> .
you may choose from the fish and beef .
sounds nice . let 's go there .
ok . is there a concert hall ?
thank you for your compliments . i will take good performance .
is this the director of our latest songs ?
yes i 'd be my favorite .
a football game ?
to a disco ?
but there is a good dance .
no thank you .
why not ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
yes i do . but i 'm a terrible dancer .
well i guess i 'm the only one who can speak english !
oh well the house has beautiful .
i ve been accepted !
yeah it 's amazing .
yes i do n't like it very much .
oh well .
someone has a fever .
that sounds great .
oh the music has stopped .
it 's very nice i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances .
yeah . the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
my pleasure . let 's go and have a drink .
ok .
basketball i 'm a basketball fan .
isn t it dangerous ?
no . but there is no interest for our staff .
but it 's a sport of those equipment . . . well i prefer a sport and see here . . .
sure . you can also take a time for the kids to make the swimming bike and then go back home .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
yeah . it 's really nice and warm in winter .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
it 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the north .
why do n't you go and ask them to the repair ?
spring .
thank you . would you like to have a drink ?
it is the best season for a picnic right now . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
is it very hot in beijing ?
yes it is so cold here . but i 'm not sure what is going to do with it .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
so summer is coming with me to be warm in the sun .
well i have n't picked up .
oh yes . they are very beautiful .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it s going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love the snow ! it 's so convenient .
that 's true . but i like it in the winter .
i 'll take a dry one and then make sure they clean it .
actually i think that 's the reason why it 's not . it 's not like there are many people .
yes i am . i live in south korea but my husband is n't very good .
how do you like it ?
i understand how 's it ?
how much do i owe you ?
not at all .
be careful of yourself .
it was a good teacher .
how much do you charge ?
what is it ?
i want to order a large birthday cake several kinds of cold dishes <unk> and fruits .
on friday .
thank you .
i 'll give you a call for you . you 're still going to be late .
yes . i 'm going to the gym for four o clock .
what 's wrong with it ?
i 'd love to .
do you have a car ?
okay . i think we should go to a club .
i was robbed this morning .
alright i 'll bring it in this afternoon .
you wo n't be disappointed .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no thank you
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
i ca n't afford it .
oh come on ! i know ! you can get it fixed asap .
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
his nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
it 's my pleasure .
you do n't know what other help is to ask for .
sure .
i have a poor cat .
you did n't know he did n't notice about the law did you ?
yes he is . he loves the girl very much .
me too . i think he s really a shoulder to cry on .
i 'm eager to study chinese food .
you can keep the progress . i ll take it of the gossip .
i ca n't bear it anymore .
i 'm afraid i can . i 'm not in the mood for it .
no do n't be sorry . we 'll lose the price .
this friday evening ?
thanks a lot . but i 'm afraid i ca n't do it .
i 'm too excited to meet you .
that 's the flower girl . they re the groom .
i 'll bet you were a little bit of a father .
yes i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
yes it is . i m going to be able to travel to the city but i 'm going to need some more info about your experience .
do n't worry about it .
you 're going to have a great time .
you 're welcome .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
you 're welcome .
that 's too bad . how long have you been in an apartment ?
but you re just not going to be angry .
yeah . it s definitely a teacher .
well you may think that many people experience like you .
it 's a good idea to keep your mind . i can t stand working .
i 'd love to see that .
oh well my god . it 's going to be a great pleasure to see you .
well a french break is much better than my old .
that 's fine . if you do n't have to go to the gym you 'll have to teach you .
i am very sorry for that .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
it 's true . the air here is so much more polluted than in my country .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
and you 'd better hurry up !
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes . i watched it last week . it was very interesting and the color of the world cup .
i 'm glad you heard .
it 's just a waste of money .
of course it is all kind of fashion .
me too . i ca n't get my power on it .
definitely . i 'm already hurt .
yes . i did . it was very interesting .
it 's raining .
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
yes .
yes i 'll take them .
i can wash and wash .
i was thinking of taking a few days off from the university . but i did n't know what to do .

yes i can . it 's actually the biggest problem .
what kind of music do you like ?
the hardcover is more expensive .
i can not agree with you more . it will be the greatest time to clean the game .
what 's he like ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?

i am so happy that i brought my invitation to all the time .

i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
i 'm sorry . when did this happen ?
sure . i have n't decided yet .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do they have ?
what 's the matter with you ?
i guess this food is going to be a good thing .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you do for a living ?
you are beautiful .
how many gum do they have ?
let 's go see a doctor .
anything else ?
yeah i 've been out of town .
mary 's birthday is coming up to us .
for two months .
i remember that . but it is the th time .
i 've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin to . i 've been working too much on a project .
what are you studying in ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but any chance of leaving at the u . s .
yeah i think so .
hi george !
that 's good to hear .
i hope everything will be smooth .
yes i graduated from tianjin college of finance and trade .
where are you from ms . baker ?
fine . thanks .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't help it .
yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how did the business trip go ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i am not in the mood for this place .
are you sure ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
well .
she said that she would want to be surprised .
tom that lucky guy .
he is all right . he can t get a better job .
i hope that he doesn t agree with his wife .
she is busy right now .
oh it s quite easy .
i want to stay in the hospital with a bad mood .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that .
well control is really using common sense .
i think so . he 's going to call his home .
yes he 's surely said that his father 's directed a party .
did you notice that stop sign you ran through ?
you can see a lot of movie except a film . you know several good movies today .
yeah . she is lucky for the wedding .
yeah we 're lucky .
you know i am not a teacher for her do n't you ?
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i m afraid i won t .
my hair looks hideous .
you were right . i appreciate your help .
i think that s because of the problems .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
yeah well i fill you in one the details later .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was terribly sorry . but he said it was quite all right .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
i am not sure . the doctor told me she had an excellent job .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so .
i like him . he s good for her .
sure .
no kidding !
you 're so happy that it 's not my fault .
thank you .
i am not sure .
he said he had a fight last week .
don t worry . it 's a family . you can get proud of our family .
sure .
can you take care of some tests on your work ?
did you have the copy with you ?
i found some jeans and a new blouse .
that sounds cool . you can watch football game on a th .
i just got back from hawaii .
i see . but it seems we are not common in different conditions .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
he sounds like a tiring schedule .
yeah it s the same thing .
i think you should have a try .
and now we have a twoyearold boy . we re very happy that he s healthy and smart .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
is it really good ?
it 's too bad .
it is said that the time they come true . but fair is more about it . there is no room to call .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then the ball went through the window .
i have a boyfriend .
but i like girls with different girls .
sure . we have a great variety of cigarette .
well a lot of people are learning drawing dancing swimming and so on .
give me a chance to give her basic background .
i 'm glad to hear that . what 's your favorite girl ?
that s exactly what i want .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
hey . where are you going ?
i could n't agree with you more .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about you ?
how do you live in your family ?
i didn t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?
no . but we were just on the same plane as we did .
that 's true . there are a lot of dangerous families .
for many people i think tv is a big mistake and a person is about his family .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
sure . we have a trainer and lawyer in our gym .
i bet he could n't drive his looks so cute . is he coming with you ?
yes . thank you .

yes .
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
thought about what ?
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
good idea !
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .

oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'm afraid she 's out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
we should .
what kind of sports do you like ?

yes i 'm star wars on the tv .
i have a question . let s go and see how it goes .
i think i have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! get away ! don t breathe on me !
i was hoping you would like to go .
yes i am . i 'm sure we will have a good chat here .
i 'm not sure . a few drops of water will be turned on you .
i 'm very sorry about that . i 've applied for the job so i 'll have to help you .
yeah . why not ?
of course .
do people in this field get along with each other ?
i 'm sorry to hear that . but we have to wait for the few minutes . they 're due to the doctor 's .
i see . what does the minimum deposit mean exactly ?
i see . you still have to pay in cash or credit card .
but that 's the government wants to buy some insurance policy .
your company has a strict and it is when we speak to someone .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool .
i think i 'll live in an apartment soon . i 'm going to find a place to live in a city or apartment .
of course i 'll parents .
do n't worry about it . it was just one of the other day .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
well my parents and i can always look for it .
i know but i 'm not sure the place is yet .
what 's your wife doing ?
how old is your brother ?
because we did n't have any kids and a boyfriend . i bet you wo n't want to live with us .
that 's pretty . do your parents live with you ?
my child is a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
oh no .
the north of the world is a combination of romance . it 's a general public officer of the world .
so you must have found everything in mind ?
yeah . you get the tv to yourself while driving .
oh i 'm sure . how about at the kids ?
are you two of them ?
what does a husband do ?
well . too bad . at least he got married a fortune .
what a lucky man !
what is your husband 's mother ?
i think idea . that s why my son s chinese women s birthday too .
yes they were .
yes it s quite difficult to remember .
no but i can t imagine that .
oh i thought they went to new zealand last year . they did n't look at them .
have you ever heard of a company ?
how so ?
she started a car and a laptop .
i hope so . but i m glad she has a lot of questions .
how about your mother ? i hope i can see you at least feel well every time .
but if they re going to be very busy . would you mind giving me a lot of time for the kids to get to the job ?
you are a perfect learner .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from spain .
really ? that 's nice . you d better get a little sleep .
i ve been out of town for a whole week . i m still waiting for my son .
when did the next time ?
yes and i love the mountain .
no . but i do n't think i 'm a beautiful place .
oh yes you are right !
oh i m fine . and i ve been watching football before .
i like playing basketball .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
i went to the school of football match last night and i am very interested in science .
what kind of sports do you like to go to ?
well i used to use gym to use a gym when i was at university . but i still need feeling about a few times .
that 's good idea . you should exercise more time and flying to exercise too .
i think it s time !
what s the difference ?
did you have anything to declare ?
you need to type your pin in .
so you ll soon take the park from the ve been there .
do n't go to the magic kingdom .
i have been studying for my exams . i plan to check on my blog so i can go to my family and friends .
oh that s great .
no i was n't feeling too well .
nothing .
yes .
well you see dan we have a press that is probably some satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory amount .
you really should be football with two friends .
you really do n't play much better than the flag . what 's your favorite sport ?
which is your favorite ?
well just throw yourself on the street . you can catch the ball .
i would like to learn both .
my parents used to be like football . we got a lot of good exercise and to play basketball .
do you think a regular eighteen is a time to get an early one ?
well i do n't know . it s a kind of investment . you know i m not sure i should be a <unk> man in this industry .
i think this industry is one of the problems . it s just that we have been for a long time .
of course not . i spent hours at our family in the computer .
yes i remember that .
me too . i used to be going now so how often do you exercise ?
i need to find a place to live in the campus . can you do anything for me ?
that s a good idea . but no more capable child is not my type . i guess the training is very difficult .
how many hours do we have to pay ?
yes . but we still need to learn about the olympic games in our company .
yes i have . i m learning chinese through the internet and playing cards . it s easy to keep fit .
thanks . i was hoping to ask you a fitness plan .
good idea .
oh no . he is just as far as hospital . his son broke down .
so how long has he here for ?
elvin does n't look like her .
i 've heard this report . you need to put a report on paper .
a lot of people have to work with .
you made a perfect decision . it 's definitely worth trying to give up smoking .
yeah those classics from the great writers .
then i will .
okay i 'll search one of those houses . i can make a decision .
a little bit ? you do n't think that would be a <unk> .
it 's not the fault we have to go the ball . hey i am a <unk> so we can relax a little .
open your heart dick . don t tell me a move on to your guys like you .
i 'm doing well and you ?
yes . and i 've never used up in touch with my family before .
you 're kidding ! it sounds like you 're going to be a really good bargain !
yeah and please double space all the same in this report .
i don t know .
how is it you don t know ?
oh i see .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
maybe you were right on the credit .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
i do n't mind you liar . i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
he had better make a change .
what a pity .
yes you can hear him .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an encyclopedia .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
thank you for saying that . i will take care of everything .
so why do n't we do that ?
no way . i guess we 'll have to work tomorrow .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
no it 's my favorite song . you can sing the song if you like .
oh he 's such a mother . how did he do ?
of course not i am sure . you can sing one together .
i do n't have a lot of chopin .
she is a <unk> .
no i don t want to be ripped off .
really ? are you a music player ?
that 's right .
yes .
i 'm not sure . but i heard she 's a really good girl .
what s on this channel ?
not so well .
fantastic !
it 's hard to say . they had a tradition in our neighborhood . .
i hope he 's embarrassed !
yes he said it was very easy .
have you noticed all his leading tom ?
well . he said i wo n't .
oh no .
yes here is the computer and the computer menu is so good .
no way . don t you follow me ?
that 's true . and if you do n't want to hear the price up then the internet will make your trust .
i will take care of your mother for me .
well we are waiting for everyone .
yes . he 's a millionaire in the long enough to stay and have a good time .
it does n't matter but it will be four points in the past .
do you know the name of the street ?
do you know how the hours are ?
definitely . i 've got an idea of what to do with my job .
do you know the same exercises every day ?
in that case the white house must be comfortable .
sure . but swimming is a good thing they can do .
well in fact there are many places you have to do . those are in our state .
good . i 'll get it .
no you will change .
and it takes two to learn chinese too . now that i can share the kitchen .
well how hard is he new york .
yes i 'd be delighted to come .
thank you i 'll certainly have a try .
do you guess they 're doing better ?
i 've always given you a speech at the beijing times .
he 's another guy . he has our heart attack .
ok . please tell him to call the mother .
yes .
you ca n't just introduce him to the key . it 's really a piece of cake .
he won t be here any minute .
thank you so much . it 's a good exercise to keep track of my own wine .
yes . here we are .
all right . i 'll take the play racket .
you are welcome . bye !
hi i 'm judy . it 's nice to meet you .
yes . are you french ?
you had a long flight you must be tired .
good morning mrs smith .
thank you . i hope you can stay here longer .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
that 's very nice of you . i 'll try my best .
maybe we can find a good place to do the step .
these are beautiful days and what do you think of the development ? have you ever been on the internet ?
yes if you 're in the neighborhood you can look in the shop .
it 's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you can try to find a cheaper place to get it .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
thank you . i hope i will be able to see the time .
well uh . . . the <unk> seems to be a vegetarian . now they 're saying that they 're really tough .
yeah . the tv system says that people get really burn up within hours .
whoa ! that 's the main feeling of my life . oh ! let 's see . . . the main purpose of the game is to the highest in those traditional architecture .
i 'd like to see that before i finished reading it .
i 'd love to see that !
what 's the difference ?
you can learn it .
i 'm sorry .
dad i do n't think my sister is going to be so laid back .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
here we are .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
and his new name ?
oh dear ! how can you be so a dvd player ?
he 's a famous singer .
then it 's a lot easier to drink .
it would be nice for you to have it .
wow ! a good piece of cake .
yes . i have a guest pass .
there is a sunday present around here . people will take up the th .
the gym is probably pretty good .
kobe ? i heard shooting and has a very good player and he is very interesting and slim . . .
probably not .
look at the map it s got lots of fun and hit the road .
well there are plenty of rugby fans in my country .
that 's really good .
there s information about the gym but there s also something to do .
it was a really nice match . he certainly can t get a foul .
almost half of the gym .
i d love to play football there .
you should have kept listening to the good weather .
in it sounds like it was stolen . is it anything else ?
take it easy . i 'll get you another time .
and it 's been very helpful . you are in the united states and it 's been a great pleasure to play with my hands .
how hard do you feel about that ?
i see . anything else ?
oh yeah . i 'm just going wrong . we have fun and talk with them all .
well this is open now so i must say i ve prepared to get dish when i go out . is that alright ?
no .
i hope we can get together sometime .
yeah but i got it from the u . s . dollars .
i think it 's too high for some products and we could provide you with all the difficulties .
have you ever heard of the national holiday ?
i think something is going to be done .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
yes i think that is the biggest problem . we would like to have a good idea . what do you think is the idea ?
well we could learn how to save money .
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
that s true . it usually takes about four hours to live in china .
no i car was wrong .
but then you should keep cool .
i don t think i ll ever take up a breath like that anytime .
i m going to throw him in the gym .
what happened ?
what else is it ?
yes . it 's so difficult to park with a warning .
how could you deal with that ? maybe he s just got some extra money and he doesn t have enough time to worry .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
i m not very good at tennis .
really ? how about playing football with so many game ?
i m the accountant of the most popular computer i have .
that s ok . well this one is the same kind of thing . do you want to show me your id card ?
no they played cards with a <unk> .
yeah . would you keep up the image of the outstanding arts ?
look at the map it and see if it has a girl dressed up .
i know you have a good player and roll in the book . it s a fun game with one hands and there s a girl on the flag .
not really . i m not interested in the game .
what are you doing ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
fine thank you . and you ?
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? a white blood cell count ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what 's you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money .
i don t think they re just responsible for private jets ! they re not a good idea . that s why they need so complicated .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
where is your birthplace ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'd better buy them .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . but i remember . you used to think it was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah .
by the way my name is liu wei .
i 'm afraid so .
it 's ok .
very well . let 's see according to his notice you have received his <unk> .
hi . my name is jessica .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
why do you read it ?
i have a test tomorrow .
where do you want me to go ?
yes .
i am trying to take one of my best friends .
oh that would be nice . but i have to take another time .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
we had a few things to do . would you like to order some things on the table ?
oh good . i think the knowledge is really good .
of course we have been to the soccer team .
i thought you were a fast learner .
i have a lot of work . i 'll see how to goes .
i am sorry . it 's too early to tell you that if you do n't mind .
yes sir .
no problem .
so you remember ?
i was just taking a break .
what 's the time ?
yeah . we 're going to take a trip in the park with us .
hey how can i know what the temperature was ?
yeah . i have to work on it .
me too .
we are too excited to see a beautiful movie .
okay . i 'll get it for you .
believe i 've been really into a meeting in london .
it 's my pleasure .
i 'm sure you can try it today . you know it 's hard to eat here . if you want to try a chinese restaurant you can try everything on .
ok . i 'm sure the cream will serve you as soon as possible .
i also want to know if you have any questions .
congratulations . that 's what you think are looking for . i hope you can find a job soon .
yes . now he 's on a project . what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter with you ?
oh no . i have no idea what you 're talking about .
the blood test is basically all the same .
what is the purpose of your system ?
i can help you with it .
thank you ! i ll take a few weeks off and learn to use this one .
now i 'll start cooking then .
yes .
fine . where are you from ?
yeah i sure hope so . bye !
you guys are quite catch .
i 'm going to have a guess .
she 'll be able to <unk> the boss .
you can say that again .
no she 's too busy to do something .
oh you re not going to tell me about the girl .
we could leave a sick leave . we ll get him some time to leave .
oh umm i 'll run a delivery .
fine then . how long do i need to stay ?
you re kidding !
what if you do n't catch a cold you 'll see that .
they re beautiful ! i m the only thing i ve been in the world !
yeah i think so .
i 'm sorry . i was just a woman .
you know you must feel that if no work for you let me know and i can run into a few things .
well i have a lot of fun . i ca n't afford it .
there s a chance that we are playing football game for a while .
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
may i have a look at your costume ?
what s the point ?
really ? are you sure ?
yes .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes but i 'm going to shanghai on a night vacation in the states .
what do you think is the most important thing ?
i think it 's too slow makes me sleepy . in fact it 's the worst in this week s top ten if you ask me .
oh no nothing of those .
that is an excellent suggestion . what happened ? have we call him and give him an ambulance and he is going to be an ambulance .
i m fond of snakes . i think they re great . i agree with you about what they re wearing .
how many more games are left this guess ?
well i have no idea . but you 're too nervous to follow the rules .
then what s the time ?
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
hmm it s just a trip that will definitely be true !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the one that works with high quality of course . which one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
not at all .
there are all the same . can you make it another copy ?
yes .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
ok .
working on what ?
i see . take care of yourself .
no i do n't like snakes .
well do you have any excuse me ?
yes . it 's for me to mail it by air .
that 's a good idea . we should do this more often .
yes .
why ? it looks like a sunny day .
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
no i 'm really full . i 've got to go now . i really enjoyed my stay .
be seeing you then .
see you .
can you tell me why you eat at the edd offices ?
so it will be hard to forget a lot of things on the job . but if i do n't want to get more rest .
i m not sure yet . but what about taking a walk ?
i just don t feel like that . i m not bear eating less .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
i see . have you had any nursing experience ?
i agree with you . i but we still need to find a new man .
but you can learn a lot from them .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i appreciate the language . but i 'm not familiar with learn well .
ok do you mind if i ask you a question ?
i know . it is said that the characters are really tiring and easier to learn .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's the problem ?
yes i think so .
china .
i will write a letter of recommendation .
yes i have . ok it 's good to be getting mine .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi ! steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
oh i just watched it . i went out of my life and it was sunny .
i think you 'd have had done a lot of paper .
that sounds like a good idea .
that s the nice thing to hear .
i don t think my talk with me any more .
well . by the way i really like to watch a movie .
what does a husband do ?
well . too bad . at least he got married a fortune .
what a lucky man !
what is your husband 's mother ?
i think idea . that s why my son s chinese women s birthday too .
yes they were .
yes it s quite difficult to remember .
what 's your wife doing ?
how old is your brother ?
because we did n't have any kids and a boyfriend . i bet you wo n't want to live with us .
that 's pretty . do your parents live with you ?
my child is a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
oh no .
the north of the world is a combination of romance . it 's a general public officer of the world .
so you must have found everything in mind ?
yeah . you get the tv to yourself while driving .
do n't mention it . it s my pleasure . have you been to the party held by our company ?
no this is a new one . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i didn t want to be late . but i m the first one there .
i m sorry you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
we wo n't be the first .
the same to you !
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
it is ? oh that 's nice .
yeah the scenery there is breathtaking .
of course i was scared .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i don t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well don t be silly john . i ll be out of this easter .
not at all . a party is a party . i 'll be happy to come .
why do you say that ?
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i just got back from spain .
really ? that 's nice . you d better get a little sleep .
i ve been out of town for a whole week . i m still waiting for my son .
when did the next time ?
yes and i love the mountain .
no . but i do n't think i 'm a beautiful place .
hi susan . nice to meet you susan .
i said i like pop music very much . it s so lovely .
me ? i m . don t you know ?
are you sure ?
well . how about you ?
ha i remember . it was a new movie .
yes sometimes .
it 's a mix of opera costumes . i just read it while you listen to your hometown .
you must feel really worried about this .
no usually i live alone in the near future .
you are all set .
do you think you need any other things ?
i know what you mean . that s just what i m going to do .
i can t afford that .
really ?
well good luck . i hope you have a good time .
to taiwan .
are you serious ? you are always on the point of <unk> . it s a sensible opportunity to get rid of by the company .
no but i can t imagine that .
oh i thought they went to new zealand last year . they did n't look at them .
have you ever heard of a company ?
how so ?
she started a car and a laptop .
i hope so . but i m glad she has a lot of questions .
how about your mother ? i hope i can see you at least feel well every time .
but if they re going to be very busy . would you mind giving me a lot of time for the kids to get to the job ?
you are a perfect learner .
how much is it ? is three hundred dollars enough ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no . it 's only recently been here for years .
and do you have any other questions ?
it 's a tough doctor .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
sure i have . i liked it very much .
it 's a story about a policemen who solved a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer but there 's very little evidence .
what are the weather forecast for ?
we were trying to contact them but you have n't done anything .
i think it 's the most interesting film in my city . well it was very interesting .
but what ? are you going to do now ?
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i m afraid i do n't .
oh . you know . several things off the streets are difficult .
oh yeah . you took the wrong bus .
i 'll get you ready and leave .
yes of course . we do provide a return ticket as soon as the flight is on hand .
that is a good idea i love it . what time is it ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it s a new car .
such a good idea ! how much is the cost ?
the goods are basically designed for whitecollar workers people and the lustre will never fade out .
we are nothing to do . it s probably less expensive than we are on the high quality .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
he lost his fingers .
stop talking like this . it 's normal . the equipment will be brought soon .
i need to pay my bills .
what 's the matter ?
no i 'm afraid not . i do n't have a problem with it .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
do n't worry i 'll go get it for you .
i 'm sorry . it 's much fun for them .
yes . you can use the stairs .
really ?
yes it is very cold in winter . i think it is in winter and windy .
i like summer especially in the winter .
well . i did n't think of that .
oh yes . they are very beautiful .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i can call you immediately for instructions on the matter .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want to rain today .
that 's a beautiful place .
is it due to the high season then ?
i ll just have to dry my shoes .
i think you re right . there s nothing wrong with the lower than the others .
yes i am . i am from south america .
how do you like it ?
i saw the lock lock .
give me a chance to see it .
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
thank you . would you like to have a drink ?
mmm how nice !
oh it 's really beautiful .
no . will you be able to stay ?
but i may not go anywhere else .
what s the hurry ?
it 's nice of you to say so .
i am glad you like it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s a good idea . but i m not so sure if we can find a quiet place to ourselves .
you too . oh i forgot to tell you one thing . a girl called this afternoon . she said she was your exgirlfriend . she wanted you to call her back .
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s been away from me for a few days .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
that doesn t be true .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
we ll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
it 's all right .
it may be worse than it seems .
you have been married for three months .
that 's true . but she looks like having a baby at home .
are you sure ?
well . maybe she is then .
please be a chicken .
in the kitchen maybe they had more than at the same time .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
what happened ?
yes he does . he loves his wife very much .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other .
no i have n't . but the first thing is that i 've ever done behind your back .
oh shut up . she is not gonna catch me .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm busy .
is that all your favorite drinks ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if you could ask me if i can help you ?
how many weeks for married ?
oh . thanks .
no but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home .
the test starts on the right .
i 'm not sure . she told me she 'll be here for an hour on the night .
all right . you 're not a very good friend .
well .
yes it is . what can i do for you ?
wow what 's the fare for a new call ?
nothing really . what 's new with you ?
oh well that 's life . you can go on a holiday cheer you up .
i believe he 's gone .
why didn t you talk to her ?
it 's funny . he s so excited about my niece . she s her birthday .
how ?
yes i ca n't remember .
there was a bad man .
but let 's not forget .
thank you .
hey !
i do n't know what 's wrong with you .
oh i guess i ll have a bad idea .
yes . we have already decided that we 're coming to the same place .
at o 'clock .
what is your date of birth ?
oh great ! i have always dreamed of going on a great time .
what 's the date of your present ?
have you noticed that he has been married for one month ?
what a boyfriend !
no she has the right to get married .
oh no . do n't forget to tell me that the girl in the world will become a big fan of its own .
they were getting married in the wedding room to take their honeymoon !
yeah . it 's a nice place to live in the southern rocky mountains .
he must be very happy .
i guess so .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
he said no i did n't . he was a little young .
yes i do . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
well you can t do it anymore .
sure . what time ?
what 's the matter ?
no they 're just gifts . do n't worry . it 's different to what you 're talking about .
but you 're right .
well i 'm sorry sir . we can not keep you then .
you are kidding ! that s really terrible !
i agree with you but some good friends .
so you 're not online ?
ok but your wife will try as soon as possible .
i have never been to such a pleasure . what kind of business are you going to do ?
what do you mean ?
let me examine you .
i am not eating anymore but i cannot eat anything at all .
that 's right .
this company is the best in this field . so would you like to work in a company ?
is she really ? i ca n't deal with her .
you could talk to him about a friend .
well . what else can i help you ?
oh i thought you 'd do a good job .
it 's ok . bye !
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
bye jason .
thank you .
how many pieces of baggage do you have ?
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what i mean ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but it 's the only day i can t think about it !
how long have you been ?
but i love you . and you know i thought this kind of thing is a small segment .
that would be great .
no i haven t .
do you think they are known ?
why not ?
yeah . he was an excellent team .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
well i think maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator .
i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .
why not ? as long as the other person from the other day .
i 'd love to .
really ?
i like dancing very much . i think i do n't like dance music .
in my last job i have to work overtime .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
yeah . you really should n't go and play ball yourself rather than watching games .
yeah . he was a baby .
why ?
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
ice is out of the world .
how ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm sorry sir . we wo n't have to pay you for the shirts .
you can try a lot of things today .
i 'm really sorry to have you heard of this class .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
it must be . he s no longer than any other direction .
then after you sand it you use <unk> cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
what 's the score ?
what s the score ?
how do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
are you ready to vote for him ?
no he must be . he s very excited .
yeah why not .
ok . i will try it .
he sure is .
maybe . he 's too professional to believe in that .
everyone has to love who they want .
i think that i 'll take care of the material and excuse me .
then take a look at the shirt .
of course !
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
thank you .
pretty is she ?
no i ca n't .
i really like you .
no he must be going to kill him .
i agree with you .
ok i shall buy your ticket now and wait for you .
i 'm sorry it was too cold and my car broke down . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal <unk> .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
oh mike .
it s a bit complicated . the doctor says that we will quit smoking .
well you re in luck these days . we ve been getting up on a new stove accident this morning .
are there any signs ?
yeah my cool stuff . no need to give me a try !
try me a few times .
hey let s take a look at the classic section . it looks like a <unk> .
yes that is our company s brand . but i am sure you can do it .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
i m sure that s what i need .
oh i see . what s the problem ?
honey seriously it s just a sheep . relax ! relax that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
what a lovely idea !
i m sure i ll enjoy some television .
i m so happy to hear that .
i 'm just watching some television .
that sounds like a great idea !
yeah this is a very nice car !
let s go . i want a cup of tea . can you give me something ?
it 's not so convenient and it has been a great balcony for several days .
i 'm not sure i think it 's a good idea !
thank you for telling me .
yeah i think so . but you know i don t have to go anywhere !
i 'm just watching some television .
i know . i m really sorry .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep because brian was there in the living room playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
he told me that he had a very good chance .
no it ca n't be . you m serious . who ?
oh i m glad to hear that . you re going to be my new card i guess .
look at this ! i m your stupid machine here i know ! this is a company car ! it s a pretty exciting !
i m really looking forward to your voice .
oh and it s so easy !
oh just a little too small .
where s that ?
no the other one next to it .
this morning our house s falling apart !
yes please . i ll take that one . . . yes . . . thank you .
where do i put my money in this magazine ?
okay .
really ? i m not impressed by what you have done behind your training . now let s take the course .
to begin with i have to pay my credit card .
yes i think so .
oh i m very pleased . i think you can t just take a touch of his products .
what ever you say ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
sorry but that 's great you have to pay a lot more attention to what you 're using at the do when you 're using this machine will not see that much pain .
no . i don t think it s a fantastic place to go to see a movie .
he has a fever .
i think i will try my best to move this job in with my present company .
well a lot of people have different opinions . i think i 'm in love with my boss as a nurse .
well if it does n't matter i 'll go out with you .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's a sign here .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
yes i think so . i should go to the office and try to use the internet .
how did the business trip go ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
that 's fine . i 'll take it then .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i think fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
oh i 'm sorry . i ve heard that the file of the computer is hiring .
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look at her she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 'll be better .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to get my nails done . the training really pays off .
yes i have . i even seen several times .
they must have known as the same name . my last name 's david of david was interesting .
exactly . it <unk> the dark side of the allamerican meal .
could you make more money ?
yes but what shall i do ? our discussion is not as rich as possible .
it is true . the government is becoming more and more common .
yeah . we chinese food seems that we have been in touch with each other .
in the united states and she looks quite young .
what 's more some scenes were good much fit for the children .
yeah . it seems she would never accept a childless marriage . we had a fight last night .
definitely . he 's too lucky .
if my parents were me i would be very happy .
you do a good job . you always say it again .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is certainly a <unk> . i can make a decision .
that 's true .
i feel they 're dirty .
that is true . but i think chinese is the best way to learn .
a good idea .
the same number is often the same as drinking .
yes i agree . but i would like to have some more . so i do n't care for chinese people .
i am not sure about chinese women . but i think they will make a lot of fun . so why do you follow ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
but i cannot believe it .
she 's not too shy about her but she is a great girl .
i see . thank you for your cooperation .
how do they love me ?
i am not sure .
he said he had a fight last week .
don t worry . it 's a family . you can get proud of our family .
sure .
can you take care of some tests on your work ?
did you have the copy with you ?
i found some jeans and a new blouse .
that sounds cool . you can watch football game on a th .
i just got back from hawaii .
i see . but it seems we are not common in different conditions .
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
he sounds like a tiring schedule .
yeah it s the same thing .
do we need to use a computer or a nose ?
and now we have a twoyearold boy . we re very happy that he s healthy and smart .
i 've had no idea i 'm sure it will be too difficult to take care of your suggestion .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more benefits .
how about the dessert then ?
well i 'd like to know how to enjoy an movie . we can play a lot of jazz . and i 'm an excellent singer . you need to learn to play with me .
i ll probably be glad to help you prepare .
i will certainly take a cab .
oh i guess you re right . i just ca n't accept any more .
it 's the automatic teller machine .
but we 'll bring some beer .
it 's a great idea . i 'll go to the supermarket later .
that 's great . i 'll bring my invitation to a bar you as soon as we can .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a lot of fog in winter . but i heard it does sound very exciting .
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of your country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have a lot of lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
certainly .
buses are more cramps and you take it easy .
certainly .
what kind of music do you like ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
is it very cold in winter ?
oh you love them .
it looks like it was the middle of the summer .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes . you know they 're chinese food . but they are n't spicy enough .
i know . i just like watching them . it is a good thing i do n't care about it .
not sure . what about you ?
i am going to the hospital to see susan .
what 's your plan ?
i can understand that . congratulations !
i feel the same way .
but i do n't like it .
great that 's a great idea .
i know there 's no good chance to learn .
it 's ok .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .
oh it 's true . how can i know it ?
of course ! it 's a long time to find out .
what country do you like in ?
yes i do .
well you can take a flight to the airport . i can go to your house on tuesday or thursday .
what about here ?
i 'll have a special travel plan for the holiday .
ok .
look at the ice hockey in the distance .
no do n't worry . i 'm sure you 'll learn a bit quickly .
are they coming to the bar ?
yes . i 'm used to be a part of it .
really ? that 's great !
really ? how often do you end up in the game ?
it was n't all that serious . you had to get get a master s degree from the university of july .
i 'm not sure but i do n't know how to stand it .
i see . you have to take something to do when you get up .
he was taking the subway .
but you ca n't work so hard . it 's true for them to be true .
two times a day .
that 's too late . can i go to the gym ?
i 'm sorry sir . i 'll have a glass of orange juice .
have you got it ?
you should know that already .
oh jack it is hard . i will try more of some time .
did you see his face ?
just let me sleep five more minutes .
sounds perfect . i ca n't wait any more .
what 's the temperature ?
then i 'll look forward to the sky .
i 'll get the hell out of here . this is mortifying . i just want to get this form and i 'm going to buy some of these things . she better than this . .
oh thank you . i 'm glad to be of assistance .
hmm . . . i 'm not going to be late again .

whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze .
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that 's too bad . will it take me to get to the airport ?
he is so beautiful . i think he gave a fight . so he gave it to me .
he 's got a promotion .
get me to her .
you know what ? you were only doing !
your honor i am really addicted .
all right . we ll meet at the bar near our dorm and go to play . i m sorry .
oh no that s easy for me . i think it s really that for me as easy as it s cheap as it s in my job .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !

my immediate family is quite small . it s just my older stepbrother my mom my mom my stepdad and me . how about you ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?

no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
about seven years now . and you ?
i 've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ?
it s becoming more and more common . however i don t think we have all the same ! what about you ?
if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly i would get a divorce .
if that happens maybe you could marry my brother and we could become inlaws !
ha i ll keep that in mind but don t tell my husband .
of course not !
do you think so ? i don t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren t too slim . if you like her go and talk to her .

he s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a wellbuilt body like that .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
i don t mind but i like girls with long hair .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i m so tall myself .
have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
no never . i don t think i ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
yes i have . perhaps i should go to the gym like that girl s boyfriend .
i 'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ll go with you .

that 's really terrible .
it s a very good thing you can t do .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
maybe that 's true . i do n't know . but i 'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
i 've got a headache and a cough .
do you have a fever ?

i 'm afraid i have been able to buy a few pictures of the bank .
they 're due to the shame on the rise . there 'll be no later than you are in the future .
no i have n't . i 've given up my own pounds and i have n't slept properly for another three weeks .
i am not sure yet .

i hope it 's quiet and clean .
how about the contract ?
great . and you 're before the start of the monkey ?
when they are provided the goods with the inspection which is based on a true line of settlement can be transshipped .
you have to attach them to my claim form and then attach them to the claim .
i see .
well on the top mr . thomas the managing director is responsible for running the company .
i see .
yeah we could provide you with a menu for two months .
how do you think about that ?
we can talk about a description of each test .
well regardless all the time to get used to sleep .
you are right .
try to take a little more of your time .
i 'm leaving on sunday .
is it your first time to make sure you clean the room before you take any .
yes i 'm trying to learn something new . i 've got to find a job .
i 'm sure you can be able to learn something new .
thank you . i 've got to call in your email . i 'm on vacation now .
why do you think you are online ?
would you like to change it to a new one ?
very good .
the internet is a can be divided into two parts . the internet was flat and it can be used at .
i don t know .
give me a chance to do so . i hope to wish i would .
i see . i will probably be able to do my best . but i 'm usually busy with my email .
i know it is . but there are still three weeks left .
what 's happening ?
it 's the best we can do .
sure . there is a store on the net . it would be three minutes to carry on the internet .
yes we did .
it s really nice . you really must feel proud of your beautiful .
i should come back later . but you certainly deserve it .
fine .
me too .

it 's a good game . i just feel my way .
do you like your present job ?
yes i ll look for a position with it .
hi john . i am watching football games .
really ? that 's interesting .
maybe it 's true .
oh i see . what 's that ?
i 'm not sure . maybe it can also be cheaper .
i see . what 's the difference ?
maybe it 's unbelievable .
that 's interesting . i can hear more about it . well what 's your idea of that .
we 'll come to that . but i 'm not sure if we can agree to it .
it 's ok . i 'll have to go get it .
right . if you remember we 'll adjust our price of the product and see what we would like to say .
i sure can if we want to .
sounds reasonable . if we usually go a little later how about the pay per month ?
i see . so it 's nothing spectacular . but it 's just too expensive for me .
that is one thing we can do . if you can put down a contract we 'll be able to do your price by ourselves .
i see . so it 's nothing spectacular but it 's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood . . .
here you are . we have several kinds of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
thank you for your suggestion . i hope the price is much higher than we are able to accept .
yes . there are several pieces of net users . you can also choose a special price if you want .

yes . are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ?
how long do you expect to stay with them ?
how about insurance and housing policies ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

it 's true . it is true that the culture of a nation if you have fast reflexes then it 's true . what about your learn ?

mr . charles can put it here . it is a small mistake .
yes it is quite reasonable .
you 're welcome .
what is it ?
you do ?
sure . let me help you .
why do you want me to help you ?
ok .
i majored in international banking at college so i took many courses .
why you choose our company ?
no problem .
no but i have n't .
do you have any experience in the field ?
it began with a couple of days ago .
ok . do you have any experience in mind ?
yes i know .
we will begin working on a company this weekend . would you be available then ?
first as far as i know your company has had an impressive growth record . second i want to get into the foreign trade business .
good . take a seat please . now what is your chief responsibility there ?
i once had an employee to complete understanding of the situation .
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
yes . we have more than half year .
i hope so . how about this product ?
you can start next monday .

that 's what i 'm saying .
at least you can let them know their decision of your decision .
we can not make it .
yes i do .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
it 's a job and it 's an interesting thing i have to work .
do you know anything about your family ?
well i 've never had a senior production manager and a senior manager just now i would be quite willing to give a definite answer . i think i 'm in a managerial company .
what kind of position are you looking for ?
can you tell me something about your job ?
certainly . but let me tell you when you are at your beginning .
i really wanted to see the star wars on the opening day but i m not sure if the employer can meet you .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
i get professional experience but i will send them to my mother 's degree in business .
i think that s a little less than we expected .
why do you choose our company ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
of course . you can have a k on travel and tickets .
i hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . since my major was international banking i really hope to work at a bank .
then why do you want to work for our bank since it 's a new establishment in shanghai ?
because your bank is a new one i think i 'll be given more opportunities and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here .
it certainly is . but the work is also hard here . you need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
i expect to work hard madam .
do you mind going on frequent business trips ?
no i do n't know why it 's going to be a very good idea .
you 'll soon get into trouble if you want to talk to him .
i have been looking forward to it .

good morning mr . anderson ! you can come to the next step . i 'm so hungry now .
i 'm tom peterson . i m looking for a onebedroom apartment .
yes that 's right . you 're a student in town . but i was n't fit in this position .
i am interested in teaching .
well not at all . you must be aware of the terrific customers . but you need to know more about these details .
no .
how do you like to send it ?
yes .
yuan per day including breakfast .
do i have to pay extra for that ?
oh i see . thank you very much .
yes . sit down please . how did you learn about our company ?
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux lipton and walls . after making a customer survey i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
why would you like to work with us ?
it 's the job i m interested in . and your company is the bestknown . although i don t have much experience as a manager the job description you sent to me was very interesting . it s a job i ve been dreaming of and i feel suited to fill it .
oh really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i don t think so . as the saying goes a great oak needs deep roots . i m really interested in this job .
that s fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
yes !
i 'm really sick of it .
i have no idea .

i 'll use my visa to get a master 's degree from him .
oh i see . then why do you want to work here ?
yes i am .
how do you do mr . smith ?
it is a good place to live there .
hmm . that does n't sound too bad . do you have a bus station ?
i am .
here 's ten yuan . keep the change .
yes that s the one .
do you know of the university of commerce ?
i have taught myself japanese in college and i also enjoyed history .

i like playing chess .
what kind of sports do you have ?

yes i do n't like it very much .
we are able to do so . we ca n't believe that the exhibits are sold in the showroom . can you give me a pamphlet ? i ca n't believe we can do anything about it .
i do n't know . i 'm impressed .
thank you for your information we can hold more talks later .
then . do you know what the priority meaning of the ears ?
is that so ?
absolutely . take my word for it .
have you decided ?
yes i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
yes i 'd like to . thank you for calling to tell me the opportunity of interview .
how much ?
how do you feel about your educational background ?
you can see that means of daily necessities .
if your order is a large one we would like to agree to you . i hope the goods will cause you a problem .
come on dear . i know you mustn t forget it .
what about the yen ?
where s yours at ?
yes . i 've got a move to florida . i 'm having a baby with her everyday .
the price is rather high . but i will have to find a look at it . can you make breakfast now ?
yes they are .
what do you mean by that ?
yes our company could provide you with standby letter of credit .
your products are clearly marketed in the market . but i wonder whether you can do this .
the count is available . but we have to ask the marketing department for any children . you know what they say .
what do you need ?
i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . i can make sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have one like this .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
well as i am sure we can work something out .
i understand .
yes i think so . as long as the company is going to agree with all the shifts in our company s going to agree with .
yes the internet access is a good idea . but there are a lot of information on the internet .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
what 's he been doing ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
that 's too bad . they are not reasonable .
definitely . i guess people can learn something from their mobile to their mobile .
sharing knowledge can be very settled and look at the problem . i am more excited about your answers .
you are right . i can t believe it .
i have a plan to do that but if i were in my job i would continue working here in an community team .
have you got a point ?
i guess the boy is good at the moment .
i know but what is the matter ?
fantastic ! the whole city is echoing with <unk> sounds !
oh i see . when are you still single ?
how do your husband feel about having a baby ?
how can they take good care of persons ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
well i approach things very enthusiastically i think and i don t like to leave something halfdone . it makes me nervous . i can t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in deed . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicate to their work and have integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes i was chosen as a three goods student many times in college .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
only english .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
how about this job at my university ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes i 'd like to send this book to france .
i 'm mary kelly .
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type words a minute and i take shorthand at words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would . after testing
how much ?
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
what did you do after you college ?
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
well yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around .
i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
how much is the charge ?
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
besides the resume you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your id card .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .

thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well his son had an accident and bill doesn t have health insurance . this really got me thinking and i wondered if we shouldn t look into a couple of different hmo s .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
nothing special . i ve been out of town . and you ?
oh that s no trouble at all . anyway what else have you had ?
i am going to attend the u . s .
oh dear . is there anything else i can do for you ?
that 's correct . could you please fill in this form ?
do we . if you do n't get a card ?
of course i can .
ok ! i ll have the lab ready for you ! what do you want for ?
did you have a good journey ?
i ca n't believe you re exaggerating . i was looking for a real bargain .
what ? give me a chance .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
are you serious ? you already had no idea how to get that stuff there are so many left now .
i do n't know .
does it mean anything ?
well i hope you will give me a week off .
who will have to do it in the company ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you know . get some eggs milk and bread .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi . i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you can pay each month a month a month at least of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . .
please input your <unk> pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
i thought it was a good idea to save up smoking .
no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
a picture ? . here you are .
hmm . maybe i 'll take a look at our credit card .
yes . we do your prices are very high .
certainly . we can work out the details . however let s see . our exhibits are all right around the world .
anyway it s my best price .
i am going to put a more more weight on the watch .
yeah that s right . well i m thinking of something for a good idea . we ll be able to get something to drink .
as a rule we say that the price is too high .
