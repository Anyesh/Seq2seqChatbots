i know . i usually get off at a . m . it usually takes a few hours .
do you have a credit card ?
yes . i will buy you a dozen too .

i think you 're right .
i don t know . this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . i managed to start it up and drive it here .
not sure yet . just a little more .
so what ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last week .
that is a strange battery . it was made by a bank ago .

you need to take advantage of what you need to make sure that you 're high .
is it all ?
yes . . . . here s the form and the money .
well i guess you re right . i just got to get paid off my business card !

i 'm afraid i ca n't . i was just too worried about my work .
i am not . i just had a bad day and i love being in a stadium because my parents are very funny .
well that s not a problem . perhaps you should put a nose on your nose nose and avoid the rich .
that s true . some people spend too much time with food .
i think you need a lot of research about a career . i d suggest you go out to a rock market .
come on . i think you are a good mom . i am not too much of a doctor .
do you think you are going to be the best person to see you are going out ?
really ? but you are really a good girl .

great idea ! now what am i going to do ?
well there s a lot of romance science fiction biography ?

i m sure you re able to have a nice holiday . i bet you will love it .
i m really not sure . there s too much i can afford .
i can t bear that ! i can t stand on the breath that s what i can t stand .

it 's important but you have to go to the gym too .
it 's very nice of you to say so .
yes . i think the air is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
i see . however however however however there are too many differences .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
why do n't you try to quit ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i do n't believe it . the problem is now on a truly global scale .

it s time to go and i hope you can get together again soon .

yeah . the autumn is marvelous here .
why ?
i dislike it when i 'm in a bit of cold .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how much is it ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah . it 's nice and bright .
i hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
that sounds good .
i know . i am glad the change of seasons like this .
hey this spot is perfect for you .
yeah . . . . hey i did n't think i can put a jacket in the water .
no i do n't think so . i said the last name of the report says it should be fine .

whatever .
well i want to go down on the neck tonight .

tom .
he is ok . he s been a hard worker .
i think that 's a bunch of nonsense . i ca n't believe it .
just fine .
it s a good idea .
he 's so pretty .
you can say that again .
really ?
of course not . his wife 's father 's birthday .
well i guess you 're right . so what do you think about it ?
do you see the sign ?
well if you had a lot of luck lately you can watch a football game in the morning .
i see . she must be really excited about the olympics .
yes .
you 've got to think about her !
i would n't do that .
i 'm glad that you did n't do me me .
it 's fun .
well there are some dangerous ones . i want to get a hold of them in my hometown so i have to get dressed in a car .
what is the matter ?
well i 'll get right back .
well take care of yourself and do n't forget to keep in touch with your good notes .
why is that ?
i think i 'm going to have to buy a new car .
i 'm not too bad .
are you kidding ? just because you are gonna get hurt .
it s very close of you to the station .
that 's terrible .
yeah i do n't like such a thing .
thanks .
i don t want to be her husband .
that sounds like a pretty height .
she said that she didn t want to live with her .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i have a terrible headache .
i 'm glad you do n't think much about them .
thank you .
no he does n't . he does n't drink too much .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
not much . i am just asking about my family .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to the travel center .
he told me that if i showed up late one more time he 'd fire me .
ok . let 's get started .
i have a bad day .
does his dad say his dad ?
he said he needs to be a successful girl .
the cat is the most beautiful thing .
that 's good .
maybe he 's just a little off .
so you 'd better beat him .
he said he 'd fire me .
i know . but i think he 's a bit crazy .
you are really a man .
i 'm quite an engineer now on the way he 's being fired .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell you the way he spoke to us .
why not ?
no i do n't think so .
really ? i ca n't believe it .
i guess they get along well with each other .
i agree with you .
really ? why ?
that 's very sad .
thank you .
i want to be a little more specific .
he said he got the peckham who got rid of it .
you can use the internet too .
no . i want to be a manager .
it sounds like you might have been going away too .
here is the money . do you need anything else ?
i ran it into a garage sale once .
that sounds like a boyfriend .
well i have a lot of questions about him .
i see . so what can we do to see in time ?
well the city life is different .
that sounds like a good idea .
yeah . it s the result of women s character .
why ? you always say that .
you have a lot of homework to be beautiful !
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did you ?
you did n't see the statue of music .
i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
did you ?
well you ca n't do so .
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell me your name and weaknesses .
oh i see .
well you can say that again .
they are really nice .
it must be kate .
i do n't think so .
but it seems you should have told him .
i like playing chess .
i guess you can keep your mind .
i like girls very much .
you can say that again .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i 'm glad to hear that . i will tell you what you are doing .
i do n't think so .
bob . nice to see you too .
yeah .
did you hear about the pilot ?
thank you paul .
not bad .
you must have a lot of family here .
my immediate family is quite small .
how many older people are there ?
how many members are there in your family ?
yes . we got married once .
that 's a point . there are a general manager of a friend in a friend in a junior investment .
i think the family is a bit more relaxed than the sea .
i have been looking forward to seeing your daughter .
yes i do . i get a bag of sugar and a few drops of cash .
oh i 'm so sorry !
thanks . i like the family .
no i did n't . why ?
there 's a special exhibition tomorrow night . i was thinking of going to a famous movie tonight . i was thinking of going to a friend . there is a special one i want to go with her .
i am afraid i ca n't .
why ?
no i 'm not .
well i have never had a wedding before .
no i m afraid i have to go now .
i 'm glad to hear that sir . i 'm really sorry to hear that . i was really looking forward to our restaurant .
i am glad to hear that . what s your name ?
nothing .
well i was just thinking about getting up a little late .
that 's great . thank you for your invitation .
how about next week ?
good . i 'm afraid we have n't got any .
no . thank you . i can only afford to buy some .
ok . i 'll take care of it .
bye .
he is a hard time to see him .
why ?
well i 'm just jealous .
i 'm sure he 's not too bad .
well it 's not worth it .
she is expecting .
that s a great time . they often have a certain amount of homework for barrel .
do you have any other particular conditions that you would like to take into consideration ?
i 'll call the police .
sure . what is your address ?
yeah i am too excited .
i am . i have to work overtime .
about .
ok . i 'll be there around p . m .
no but i 'm not allowed to sit over there .
sure i will be happy to bring a few minutes .
we will come to the car park at the square .
that would be great .
what happened ?
then what 's your idea ?
wow . that 's really nice of you to comfort me .
yes ! i went to the park with a girl from the breath that s when she is driving out .
i will get there .
no . that 's terrible .
i think that the issue is much more important than the meter .
i see .
he 's a manager .
you can find one . you can have one .
sure . but you are crazy .
sure . we can put together a meeting .
well . . . okay .
i guess it could be better if we could not keep together .
she 'll be happy to see you .
i do n't know . i think it 's better for me to have a job .
i think there s nothing wrong with my boyfriend .
yeah . but many white ones are very thin .
well what are you going to do ?
well i think maybe i should invite my friends home .
i m sorry to hear that . have you been there before ?
ok . i m very sorry .
yes . that 's why i 'm here .
i 'm glad you like it .
we planned our wedding for next may .

i 'm glad you told me that you got a raise .
we 're going to live in london .
are you going to get a place away from us ?
yes . i need to make sure .
hi sterling !

he 's very strict with himself .
but he 's not a good scientist .
well maybe you are right .

i 'm glad you like it .
yes it 's a nice thing to see you .

yes . may i help you ?
i 'm looking for a black leather bag .
yes .
i 'm glad you could come to the office this afternoon .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
well jim . that is a combination of how much you eat a lot of vegetables and a little oil .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a good idea . you have a good memory .
i guess it 's just a good idea .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
you mean i have to admit it doctor .
perfect ! could n't be better .
no don t worry . i m sure you ll get better soon .
it 's just what i want .
okay .
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you are happy .
i 'm glad you say so .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . what time is it ?
well we could really use the internet too .
well i suggest you bring me some chicken and juice .
well let 's see .
well i 've had a hard time . but you know i 'm really tired .
well then maybe we could go to the movies .
what did you want to see ?
what do you mean ?
i think the only way is that the wall is too heavy for me .
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well then shall we go and get some stuff ?
ok . i 'll get her .
i 'm sorry but i do n't quite follow you .
well it 's not too much trouble . i 've got a lot of work and i 'm not sure if you do n't have a chance to see here .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
that would be very useful .
i 'm very tired . i 'm having a party .
you 'd better take a rest at home .
with everything with everybody with all this !
you need to talk with a holiday .
it was a great party . thanks for coming .
i do n't think i 've ever had a boyfriend for a long time .
i mean if i had a child i would never end out studying .
that s a good idea .
it was a pleasure to do business with you .
ok .
i 'm going to the gym too .
that 's good . what time is the food ?
it was just a little naughty . i had to make a date with my son and i had to place her own place .
you mean you like him ?
no he 's not . may i take a message ?
i 'm glad to hear that .
what s the matter ?
just fine . what s up ?

i have a sore throat .
i m sorry . i ll be too tired .
yes i 've just moved here . i 'm sure you will .
that 's all right . i 'm also going to have to get some medicine for you .
you can take care of it .
yeah . i 'm fine .
you have to pay a fine .
do people get a <unk> one another in the same old workplace that he gives a good grade to get along with each other ?
well they have to wait until the meeting is going to be late .
in my opinion it is covered by the buyer 's account .
yes . you can have this card free if you want .
that 's not true . just keep going out and get a better discount .
yes it is quite reasonable .
i think i d like to be a well in the future .
that 's cool . have you found anything at your company ?
no but i 'm not sure if i can afford to live in a quiet apartment .
no i 'm not . i like going out .
well if you want to go there i 'll just give you a call .
that 's not bad . they 're not so heavy . it 's not allowed to move out until the older ones got to live in the neighborhood .
i know . it sounds like a mother . she 's going to be married once a year .
well i guess you 're right . i can always remember that myself .
i know . i know a place that is a place of interest . i want to get a place that is good .
ok . what 's your uncle bill ?
do you have a credit card ?
they 're just asking me to come out and visit my family .
i see .
my mother is a part of my chinese . my mother is a part of my mother . she is a part of my mother .
sorry !
you have n't had a lot of experience in that type of job . it 's important to have a heart of computer that is important to the comfort of life .
i see . well i have three older brothers and sisters . i got a pair of younger brother in the states . i can get a pair of them .
yeah you get used to girl 's pet after having a pet .
i see . well what about the family ?
i 'm glad i did n't know .
what is that ?
well you are changed my wife .
what a surprise !
is that all ?
i know . i know china is a modern hobby . i guess my mother is a little more relaxed . i know my mother is an american . i know my mother always cooks me dollars .
i know . but they ve always been an executive for the past two years .
it is . it is quite reasonable .
i have a few . i 'll be at my girlfriend s birthday present .
oh yes they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year .
have you heard of being a teenager ?
well if you like my company you ve been doing a very good job and have a lot of business between us .
she is a nurse .
i hope they have things to be arranged by .
that sounds like a good idea .
do they have to pay if it does n't have to be late ?
i think you need to learn something from him .
i ve been playing with my friends .
that s cool . have you been on the company ?
well i ve been playing it for quite a few years .
what time did the meeting leave ?
yes .
no i did n't . i enjoyed the trip .
oh yes you like skiing . it s really scary !
very well . i like playing basketball too .
well i like playing basketball but i think i can play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week .
yeah it 's a good thing for you .
yes i like it very much .
i know what you mean . i ve always thought that most of it .
i used to play golf play badminton or crack in my country .
you want to play some jogging ?
i know .
but i m not a good student . i can t afford to be able to play a modern way .
well you have to go to the dentist . i ll see you spent a lot of money on it .
i 'll give you a call at the end of the road .
you ll see the national anthem .
why do n't you go to a concert instead ?

no . he gave me a good review .
no kidding ! that 's out of paper .
i think they must be just excited about their life . they also have a good range of paparazzi interfering with star s .
i guess they might . i guess they might be able to take care of it .
i think that they only request people to get more publicity for their films . they only have a films and even films for themselves .
i think they only have a few publicity for their films . they only have a films films films and themselves .
i see . that s why they have all kinds of films and films on sale . they have all kinds of films and even <unk> .
i don t think you re going to be a millionaire . they want a good range of paparazzi interfering with star s private live in a zoo .
i see . they need to invest some money to bring them back to my office so that they can be less fortunate than themselves .
that s really cool .

dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! i know the handyman and my work cut out for him .
i 'm not . i just want to be a joke .
you mean fat ? you know i m feeling a little nervous .
yeah it is fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot .
yeah that s a great idea . maybe i can also have a try at least one day off . maybe a little later on !

how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?

no there is no need . i 'm going to be too late .
but we cannot wait for a long time . it 's a love story .

not bad . i just got back from hawaii .
no i have n't . i saw an review . it was an exciting film .
it must be interesting . i mean they play an early song . what about the languages song ?
exactly . the <unk> with the yellow building is always next to the falls .
i could n't agree with you more .
i see . but what can i see ?
i am really surprised . i really want to hear that .
oh yes . we 've just been wanting to get married a lot of business .

great idea ! i ca n't believe he 's a good man .
how about your family ?

he 's really very strict with himself .
yeah . he 's really good to see you .
what number is the suspect ?
i do n't know . he 's been having an accident .
maybe i 'll tell him .
that 's what i need .
she can make her own decision .
you are right .
well i think maybe i should go to the store and have a look at it .
i think you are right . the american way is that a foreign currency account .
that 's a good idea .
mine are n't too many tastes . the same way is n't it ?
i see . but i think men should be attractive .
i am afraid not . i will try and see what they look like .
i mean if i had a child i would never end out studying .
but i think a little accent . i m not sure yet .
she 's my wife 's birthday .
i agree . i will get your point right now . i think i will get your point .
how do you know her ?
i want to be a little more specific .
he said he got the peckham who got rid of it .
you can use the internet too .
no . i want to be a manager .
it sounds like you might have been going away too .
here is the money . do you need anything else ?
i ran it into a garage sale once .
that sounds like a boyfriend .
well i have a lot of questions about him .
i see . so what can we do to see in time ?
well the city life is different .
that sounds like a good idea .
yeah . it s the result of women s character .
do you have a facial mask on this ?
you have a lot of homework to be beautiful !
yes i know . i 'm not so sure if i 'm not clear on it .
you can ask the boss about the job .
i 'm glad you like it .
well i 'm not as good as i know but i 'm not sure whether i can do that .
it 's a great idea . i 'll get a concert tickets .
i will get a better one .

that sounds great . i 'll be happy to bring you a beer .
it 's quite an interesting place to live . the weather is like spring and the weather is often quite cold .
we know about the winter . we get a little too much rain . the rain usually takes about half a half a half a year .
what are the temperatures in winter ?
in winter temperature often reaches about or in the morning . in the afternoon some cold weather report some day temperature can be below zero at least .
yes some thunderstorms then . in the afternoon there is a very thunderstorms this week . in the afternoon there is a very fine with the air in the afternoon .

yes . i heard it was very beautiful .
it is not as good as i know because the air is also a source of snow sport .
well my country is a very flat .
i know but i still ca n't agree to such a place .
not really . the only problem is a few dollars for a flat .
yes i know . i have never been to the top of that .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up the coast .
that s great . there are too many lakes and rivers but much damage . there are also many lakes and lakes .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have a lot of lakes and rivers .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains .
there s some but it s not very bad . there s a lot of crime . there s a lot of crime . there s some crime but it s not very easy . it s a lot of noise and there .
the government is committed to handle the drug addicts who need to produce things like that . they need a lot of money to get the things we need .
that s a very good idea . i know a lot of people who get a little oil . it s a very good deal .
some people believe that a tough approach is better .
i think that is just a way of getting rid of nature . more time i have no idea of a business trips on the road .
that sounds like a dreary saturday .
i ve been to several countries in europe but i ve been to several countries in europe .
