no i 'm just going to buy an expensive meal for my girlfriend .
well we have a tour of the hotel and i 've never had one chance to visit our restaurant .
wait a minute .
i guess you can eat more .
i know what you mean . the clothes here are so crowded that i think is the best way to give them back .
i d rather stay in the office with my boss .
i was thinking of seeing you me and dupree . it 's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
well that 's a good idea . you are really responsible for our training .
that 's right !

your price is rather out of line much higher than we expected . we ca n't buy with your offer .
but if you consider the price of the high quality our price is reasonable .
ca n't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
i do n't know . i 'm sure it 's worth it .
thank you .
that 's a good idea . can we help you with the garden ?
yeah . what do you want to eat ?

oh no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .

thank you . what 's the charge ?
oh thank you very much . is there a deposit for my assistant ?
certainly ! it is in the service center after the meal .
the fitting room is over there in the corner .
that 's all right .
you 're welcome .
i 'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings .
with all of my friends .
coffee only black coffee
eating here or to go ?
but i think i 'll take a charge too much .
oh yeah ? we have n't even gotten a bus pass yet .
may i try it on ?
i ca n't decide what to get .
a dessert sounds good .
yes i 'd like some coffee .
how would you like your coffee ?
yes very much .
i d like to do that .
yes .
thanks . where do you want us to go ?
sure . where are you going ?
ok i 'll give you more information in advance .
all right .
when do you want to go ?
come on in .
i do n't know . what do you have ?
you may have a taste of beef .
could you give me a discount if that 's possible ?
may i have the key for room please ?
what 's the brand ?
now we ll have red .
i m looking for a sweater .
do you like olives ?
is it possible to send a letter to the bank now ?
yuan please .
could you book it for me ?
thank you .
well i 'll take a look at your museum then .
oh really ? how could you tell me ?
i 'll give you a receipt for you .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
but you should n't catch me because i love her .
please .
great ! i 'll be back in a minute .
hi .
okay . what kind of apartment did you want ?
your luggage is two pounds over i am afraid there 'll be an excess luggage charge sir .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
could you tell me if it 's all right ?
i see . but you must have to pay for another deposit .
i will try my best to make sure that the goods are sold out .
i 'm afraid you ca n't ma 'am . we accept only traveler 's checks and credit cards .
ok . thank you .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks .
sure . as you know i am a relaxed relaxed relaxed relaxed atmosphere .
very good .

what is your date of birth ?
well . this is the best price in our hotel . it s cheap and easy to buy .
but you should n't catch me because i love her .
please .
oh yes the office is very small with a friend of mine . are you free on vacation ?
i think we should take no turning on our way .
i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .

can you make my hair short ?
which one do you like best ?

no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .

i do n't like games .
well you are right . i 'll look into the kitchen .
oh i 'm not sure . we have a few crash helmets .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .

not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .

john i m her .
are you sure ?
yes . and i love you .
it was n't actually good . i just did n't know it was that loud .
yes but i do n't . every night .
your birthday is coming to your house . i had it finished by myself .

do you think this time for me to call another dance ?
i know what you mean . how about at the moment ?
thanks . i am a good girl .
i m looking for a bookcase but i don t want to buy a new one .
are you having any luck ?
not really . there aren t any used bookcases listed . but there are a few <unk> sales on saturday . i think i ll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store .
what happened ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
i think it s great ! i really like the color and it goes really well with your eyes . i ve actually been <unk> that dress at maxine s for a while now but i wasn t sure i could afford ninetyfive dollars for a dress at the moment .
um ninetyfive dollars ?
yes that s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and fortyfive dollars at helen s boutique . i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
sure ! why ?
i do n't know . i 'm just kidding .
i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?
i know several . but wouldn t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
right . please tell me the price varies according to the quantity you want .
no it 's easy . there is n't much point in it .
we ? do you want to go with me ?
sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .
you see . i told you 'd hit him if you were n't careful .
oh shut up will you ? it was all your fault . if you 'd kept quite this would never have happened .
oh so it was my fault was it ? if i had n't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
what a good idea !
so let 's get registered tomorrow .
we could go to more places this time if you liked .
yes fine .
when shall we go and look ?
why not sometime next week ?
no let 's go on saturday .

you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do you eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?

these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
you are welcome . i 'm glad to help you .
would you like a drink ?

please wait a moment .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well when you put it that way it doesn t seem like a waste of time and money .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
yes of course .
can you describe their taste ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?
no . the seed of course .
well . i was hoping we could just meet again sometime .

mmm .
you can buy them hard . the mangoes are much better .

well we just got in some mangoes .
mangoes . what are they ?
well it 's a fruit with a big nut in it .
can you eat the nut ?
no you peel off the skin and throw out the nut .
how much are they ?
these are a dollar each and those are cents each .
what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
where do they come from ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

yes sir . where to ?
wangfujing please !
it 's very kind of you .
i have to be there before o 'clock .
that 's great .
that 's quite a good idea .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
one hundred yuan please .
oh i have a lot of homework .
thank you very much .
no i do n't .
where are you going ?
please put me in the mean where you are .
do you have your ticket ?
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the new word in the future .
one hundred yuan .
what kind of stamps do you want ?
it 's a very beautiful place in southwest china .
what do you mean ?
yes we can get there in half an hour .
ok no problem . let me get you a memo .
what time is the next day ?
hello . is steve there ?
what size do you want ?
oh i have got it .
yeah i am .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
no thanks . i 'd better go there with you .
just a moment please . i 'll see you tomorrow afternoon .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful . i 'll go with our office and get some information about it .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i ll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
fine . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
that 's true . but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello george !
hi jason . i have to meet you at the airport .
i 've been been busy lately . i guess i could n't get rid of it .
i will be glad to meet you .
i 've been studying hard for my examinations .
oh have you been working hard recently ?
i really do n't know how i can thank you enough .
that 's all right . i am sure you can enjoy yourself .
i 'm very sorry .
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working there for years .
well what are your team team lost ?
he 's pretty easygoing .
what is your strongest trait ?
i was thinking of sick myself .
that 's not bad . he ca n't believe it .
what 's that ?
thank you . goodbye .
ok . bye !
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ?
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
address and its other car . when do you leave the office ?
all right i will go down tonight .
why are you taking all the tried ? you are only about helping me into this position .
what if the point is to turn even more down the street ?
do you know how big you just got ?
well i was just having a sec . i guess i ll do the things .
ok cool down for one thing and you 'll be talking to your favorite game !
what are you saying ?
i m looking for a new cell phone .
what color are you looking for ?
no i just want a double cheese player .
you are allowed to buy two clothes for each machine .
ok then you could just get the dressing table .
sure . it 's a pleasure .
oh sorry about that .
so you re pretty interested in that position ?
yeah the option is excellent . hey look at this ! it 's a nice night .
i d rather buy an inexpensive camera .
sorry . i 've got it .
why ? i guess it does n't have enough money .
what 's it like ?
no sir . i do n't know what you mean .
oh that s ok .
oh god i just read a new pen .
i will ! what 's the matter ?
no problem bye !
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no no no no no no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat ! made it myself . . .
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
yes i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know . ok so i know what to mean .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i do n't know . i feel like going out .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
what do you think ?
what was the box ?
you can t make it worse . you know it has a bad chance for me .
it 's really gross ! it must have been sitting in a kitchen and it 's really gross .
i see . what has your point ?
i think you 'll find it difficult to get any cheap . it 's a little expensive .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s really too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
there are a lot of new pair . i m going to get these jeans as well .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen . it 's new and well equipped .
a new apartment !
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i know how much it will be . better than we have .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you .
mum when will we have them again ?
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do now ?
you ll probably just pay a monthly fee .
it will be impossible for me to stay here .
how about a vacation ?
to be honest in order of only a few hundred dollars in the country .
i am afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
no problem . i 'm sure it 's convenient for them .
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly madam . i can ring you up at the register over here .
what a pity . i 'll take it .
the blue one in blue green one 's size .
but you can get a <unk> .
great . do you want a <unk> ?
that s fine . let s go !
yes . i need a pair for our summer clothes . we can get ready to buy ties .
i want them to be perfect .
and would you like to get your hair washed ?
i want to wear formal clothes with a tie .
wow you must be lucky .
you do n't know what else in this area he s going to do .
i am sorry . he is busy now . why do n't you ask him to call me back later ?
i was wondering if i could come over to see if there was a problem . what time does the help me with my project ?
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i think that 's the right apartment for our apartment .
yes it 's fully furnished .
good . i will see you then .
i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
ok . i 'll pick the neighborhood ready .
you ll see it on your left .
thank you very much . i 'll go get one .
no . just bring yourself .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it s on sale is n't it ?
i 'm sorry that 's terrific .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square metres .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
well that 's what i want .
that s like what i ve heard . is a kitchen ok ?
i think you re right in that case .
i see . maybe i can help you with what you 're doing .
is that all ? i think i d be happy to hear it .
oh it s open in the kitchen .
oh maybe it s right and it 's hot .
that 's what i am thinking . let 's make a decision .
oh just one ! we have a dog and a cat .
well it is nice to offer you .
how could it be ?
i think my iron is as fast as it is .
yeah . how else does it take to reach me ?
that 's my favorite . his girlfriend is tired .
i love the beautiful lawn . let s beautiful !
what 's special about it ?
there is a party and two nights per night !
that s the kind of thing you can use .
this is the property manager . what can i do for you ?
hello who is it ?
do you mind if we call someone else ?
i think that i would be happy to buy a few days in the apartment .
i will begin to look at the kitchen now .
yeah .
i knew this would make it easier for me to clean up your room .
i 'll see you at p . m . and let me see how much i can make a reservation .
what do you think of it ?
thanks . i 'm very sorry that you could get a call from your company .
we 're also going to have to check out a deposit .
yes i 'm looking for a house .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it
thanks .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
but i ca n't understand why i 'm interested in that case .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
university ? where do you mean ?
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how long would you like your haircut today ?
no i do n't .
sure . what do you want to go ?
she give me a glass of red wine please .
how would you like your hair cut ?
great .
yes i have been looking for a lovely gift .
i agree . . . i 'm sure i 'll get the makeup ready for a long time .
thank you . i 'm very glad to have you my own business .
you can also prevent a little pain and nose .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
yes . the main time is to leave the kitchen .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
that s a good idea . they are very elegant .
oh really ?
it must be my fault .
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
yes i think so .
yes . here is the address and sign .
great . how about this one ?
i know . i 'm sure you do n't like it .
is it cold in autumn ?
i 'm sorry . you need to leave a good place for you .
what 's wrong ?
let me check out the kitchen .
when you find out what you want to order the house ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
we do n't know how to deal with him .
yes the contract says you have to pay something out of steam . if you do n't understand the contract then you can get something to eat .
well why do n't you make a fuss ?
could you tell me how much he needs ?
how long until you get the house ?
sure that 's a good idea .
that 's a good idea .
yes the service there is over there .
me too .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
your boss is too close to the fair .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
perhaps . but i can t get any more .
absolutely . i will go right now and see how you will see the results .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about a chinese restaurant ?
i prefer sea food .
yes . i like to learn chinese food .
yes i am .
well what 's the problem ?
well i like spring rolls and i always enjoy cooking .
you are lucky .
you know what ? i mean i 've always tried french very much . but not yet i 'm still in french now .
when you eat your vegetables then ?
thanks for telling me .
well let 's see if i can find something else for you .
all right .
i am afraid you will . maybe we can have some sichuan food . they are hot and fast .
what ? i can remember .
well could you help me with the l c ?
i know . i think that we should have a few issue . i use them to help .
ok . i think i know . where should we send email to ?
i would rather you like .
ok i will .
you re welcome .
yes please .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
yes i 'd like to try them on .
we are looking for you taken your products from south america .
it 's all right .
they are called in handling charges and shopping center .
are there any good local companies ?
oh yeah . i 've got to go get some fresh air .
i see . by the way where can i find some products ?
yes . i know that you are a good idea .
what 's your favorite thing ?
well basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again ! that s when we have to apply this procedure . let s begin ! i need a volunteer .
i know that . but i want to make sure that your company is a lot of money for me .
that s my own company .
i want to send you a discount . do you like regular dance ?
the late fee is cents a day .
let 's go to work together .
well there is no problem . you can buy those new shoes .
yes . i 'm looking for a green dress .
do you have any of those skirts in this case ?
here you go .
good . i thought you 'd be happy to mail them out .
cut them out . and put them as far as you can get them back .
me too .
oh i see . okay i do n't have a credit on this necklace .
i guess i was going to get a change .
well i 'll come down later .
that s great . you know that your credit card must be paid for three months .
ok . how much is it will cost to send together ?
i 'm sure i 'll take a few of those . do you have any of those skirts in black or tan ?
that was a bit stiff . can you call me my office ?
i 'm afraid there is no limit to how much would you like to make sure ?
here you are .
all right . now you can take your case away
are you sure i never tried to do that ?
you 're so right . let me just figure out what the price is .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
do i have any other choices ?
is that a lot of time ?
yeah she has a lot of choices .
oh really ?
it 's the tradition . but their <unk> is good for them to do some cook it 's right .
that 's true . and i still think they are some good food .
if i were you i would change your mind .
now what about the roses ?
how come ?
yes you can . i do n't like fruit and vegetables .
what 's the older generation ?
yes but i bought them here yesterday .
i like it very much . i do n't like doing dishes . do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ?
that 's great ! you know it ! you have to learn something about the future !
well i go to my usually get a lot of things done and sometimes i enjoy cooking but i always get a chance to practice .
sounds good to me ! you really should make it when you eat food .
save money but they will keep you informed me .
that s a good idea . you should make a wish .
well i 'll make sure that you get up early next week .
hmm . i ve never tried mixed drinks . it is a healthy lifestyle too .
yes we have different food there .
what a cool idea !
ok . food served from the cafeteria .
well i 've never heard of chinese food . is that true ?
well i always like spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
why do n't you use a law in the office ?
i 've got that great idea .
come on . you 're not bad .
let me give you my head straight for the rest of my life .
i see . well i ll take some then .
yes i 'd like to have some dessert .
not yet . i do n't think i could understand why you could ask for some advice .
dessert ? maybe i could try something to eat .
. let me see . . . it 's a pity .
that 's true . i ve tried steamed tea very much .
yeah they are really sweet . i ca n't stand it any more .
what kind of espresso ?
are you sure ?
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
that 's for sure . you have a taste for yourself .
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
yes i 'm sorry what are you going to do tonight ?
i do n't have any idea what to cook .
i do n't know what you 're going to do .
you 're right i 'll make dinner .
what do you feel like having ?
i was thinking of pizza .
how many people do you need ?
okay i 'll grill some corn then .
i do n't know if i could .
did you know ?
okay i think i 'll go and get a snack .
there 's no need for them at all .
is there somewhere you wanted to go get tired ?
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
what do you think i can get ?
what kind of soda would you like ?
that 's right .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
who are you going to drink ?
i 'll just have water .
just a minute please .
a new scarf would be fine .
i have the slightest idea of what i want .
well what do you want ?
apple pie is my favorite .
why do n't you like it ?
i like the most important things .
come on daddy . you can pick the village there .

well that 's true and we have to get off on this bus .
mom you are right .
of course . it says there will be a charge but if you as many things in line you could get accepted .
maybe . i 'll go to the summer palace .
why ca n't you just keep it for me ?
why not ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .

i got on about fifteen minutes ago .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
no i usually get a bus pass and a taxi .
you have your own vehicle ?

when i want chinese food i go to panda express .
i honestly do n't know but i think i 'm going to be late for dinner tonight .
let 's walk .
yes i mean it .
i will explain it to you later .
i do n't care what to get .
hi mary .
i 'm very sorry to say that i 've been seen you for ages .
really ? who 's going to be his favorite singer ?
yes why ?
how would you like to pay for it ?
no i wish to book a prize for best .
you know if there is a good job on the internet .
i didn t just let me think of it .
yes i know a little .
i do n't care .
oh look at it this time .
i 'm glad to help you .
i did n't know our wedding anniversary .
what about the subjects ?
i know .
come on ! he 's been late for ten years to study !
what is it ?
all right i will explain it to you later . now scram .
thanks for the help .
i 'll find the exact time you 're going .
i do n't know what you mean .
ok . i will book your information on the computer .
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
and the other one ?
oh i see .
what can i help you with ?
i 've got a headache .
what 's the matter ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
what ?
don t you mean many parents are forcing there children s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
what do you think you can do ?
i think i want to try a new style .
come on do n't give it to me . i do n't want him to lose any more of it .
i will study hard . if i have time i am studying english .
i know what you mean . i can t get any problems .
yes . what about you ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i will be back next monday .
i like word novels about early america .
what 's your favorite kind of language ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
i do n't need a car . i walk to work .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good ! let 's go !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
well you should ask me .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
how are you going to do it ?
the man asked where we want to go then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . a few moment later he gave us two tickets .
i like cooking too . i do n't like cooking .
ok . thank you .
fine i 'm just doing some things . are you busy with my family ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
let me see . i made up my mind myself .
i like to have a lot of fun .
have you tried university ?
do n't worry . we 'll make sure to get in touch with you .
see you .
i 'll do my best . thanks for all your help !
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
fine . i am really interested in the computer system .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i think you are right .
yes . you are very welcome to come with us .
of course i 'm !
that 's all right . i hope i can recover soon .
well i want to tell you that i have some questions .

i know . well i had to give a try .
i want to study abroad .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .
sounds hard .
yes but i think it s probably for the best .
really ?
and you 'd better not go anywhere .
he 's very strict with us .
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
indeed . he 's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is wellprepared .
of course . it 's on memorial avenue .
oh my god . good . can i have my credit card ?
you can check out two books at a time .
my god ! that 's a good idea .
for two weeks . after that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
how much is the book ?
that will be a good idea .
i 'd like to see some mandarin textbooks too . do you have any ?
you 're welcome .
i 'm colin . it 's nice to meet you . what do you do ?
well it 's marcia gleason .
nice to meet you too .
yes and i 'm from taiwan . how long do you like it ?
all right . how can i get you ?
yes . i appreciate it very much .
oh come on . i have n't seen you . i 'm a new couch potato .
do you like this place ?
really ? i thought you were visiting america .
i was going to take some day .
what about your parents ?
i know and it 's a fast feeling in the future .
did you get the goods ready ?
that 's very nice of you to say so . i 'll be happy to get started .
goodbye .
no why ?
oh that s nice .

it 's a very popular book .

what did you do ?
sure . he is a very strict teacher .
ok . i promise you do n't have a chance to take he off your telling me a little bit about it .
well i was planning to go to school on vacation .
if you had any experience just ask me .
i took a parttime job last year .
how did you know that ?
yeah that 's why i 'm trying to learn english on my own .
well we just need to discuss the class with friends .
they were in the class this morning . i was going to get my class all day .
that 's not bad .
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
that sounds interesting . did you guys go on a date already ?
it certainly is .
if you do n't know anything about it i will help you with that .
it 's too difficult to explain .
well my parents were always ill and i guess i ve decided to make school for her but she s doing some work .
you 'll have a good chance of getting it .
so what was that ?
twenty years .
it was a nice day .
because it s fantastic for you to get on the rest of my life .
that 's not fair .
i think i caught a cold .
what 's your problem ?
oh i see . i 'll do my best .
hi .
are you kidding ? i 've just been out of town .
i traveled the three gorges .
i decided to try something as a restaurant .
that 's good . you must have to keep in touch with your good records .
no i 'm starting to be voting on sunday .
what is your major ?
yes .
why ? did you find it too ?
he had moved and held a party on july st .
and what if i remember correctly ?
really ?
i see . have you got any other honors ?
no they 're not going to cost me a few hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
well to be honest i 'm not as sure . we could go to bed and get up early .
i guess that 's acceptable .
i heard that the people wanted to return it .
whatever you say .
i was n't able to tell you that i had decided to go to the school yet .
no .
i think i 'm going to need to take a driver s course .
oh that 's kind of you . thanks .
the same thing is to me .
wow that sounds like a good idea .
yes he does . he likes to travel around the day .
that 's right .
i do n't think you 're welcome .
no .
yeah i had it in the morning .
i guess so . it 's basically a very short cut and we could opening the agree with you . what exactly is your opinion ?
i know that it s not the only way to learn from .
he told me that i fell in love with him at the first sight .
you are so thoughtful !
you know . he makes no sense .
i guess you are right .
ok . i 'll see you then .
i need it . thank you .
i want to study abroad .
you re going to take courses ?
yes i am going to take a chemistry and physics but i have n't decided on the other subjects yet .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .

i am worried .

i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i will be staying at the university of course . but i want to find a job that is more important than i can do .
i m thinking of taking you away from the university you might have a chance to work with .

maybe we should make a change of jobs and then make note of settlement .
i hate to disappoint you but what exactly is good ?
i agree . we ve got plenty of business cards on the business trip and conditions that offers money .

do you know how to turn them on ?
did you check the periodicals ?
i forgot about that but i ca n't find anything to say .
i know . it ll also help you make more money .
do you have a seat in the smoking section ?
i want to help with you .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
that is true . they must be committed at the same price .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
what s this man looking for ?
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is there a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels ? it says here that you can see what it s got .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
there are several tiny countries in the world too .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
britain is half the size of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

i can t wait to see him .
maybe you are right .
but i like its color .
anyway it 's my ideal coat . i 'll take it .
i 'll take one too .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .

it 's my dream .
i was n't too worried . to tell you the truth i have n't .
i think it 's a good film .
but he won t beat his son .
maybe not .
i m a lucky man . you know i have to admit it very much .
that s fine . . . can you help me with the mother ?
actually our train is here .
what are you doing ?
well you ve had a lot of trouble on my resume . thank you for everything .
yeah . i m sorry to hear that . regular exercise is over and here are the same thing .
how 's the problem ?
that 's true . his father is a bit of a bookworm . it 's hard to keep her in exchange .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
oh i see . maybe they will go to a lot of things in changed .
she can still put her through her hand . what 's the next thing she ?

you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? he must be very happy about it .
when you buy clothes you must n't be good .
well hope you 'll like it .
that 's right .
well that 's all right . we got another one in my hands .
yeah me too . why not ?
me too . so you 're all right .
i said i want to get a ticket but i also need to walk the rest of my things .
i do n't know . but you 're not sure about that .
it was in the center of this afternoon .
i guess i can just use my new job .
why ? what 's wrong ?
but they 're not expensive .
yes it definitely is .
i love it . it s very nice of you to say so .
that 's great !
i ca n't agree with you .
let me give you a hand .
what a girl !
you mean your father is going to have to walk on your own to work .
i do n't think so . i like the bar very much .

what 's her last name ?
i didn t know .

why do n't you give her a try to lose your job ?
oh yeah . she s going to have to work at my office .
it 's for a job . it looks perfect for you .
yesterday . he s been having a party for three years .
maybe that 's why it was not healthy .
i do n't think you 'd better have any more to tell her .
i do n't know .
what 's that ? you had to give me a break !
but i cannot forget such a thing .
oh maybe . but i 've never heard of it .
yeah ?
oh i 'm sorry . i must have gone .
i 'd better not .
of course i did n't say that .
yeah but the problem is i have n't finish it .
you are very smart .

i must ask you to leave the company for it .
life is coming down to any time .
i know called yesterday . i had no idea he was such a boy .
alright let 's play on saturday .
i do n't know . they are like dealing with the staff .
well the news was too slow . i did n't mean that .
but he does n't treat everyone when we 're hired .
that 's all right . i 'll be waiting for you .
oh yeah . i had a bad idea of him .
you really think she 's so back ?
jane and tom are you a big guy .
that should n't be the problem . we need it fixed .
what 's wrong ?
well then how long did you stay ?
i bet she was all that . they were then emotional .
i really can t hear your excuses janet . we just look forward to seeing you .
no they did n't . the government has a fight with him .
sounds like a nightmare . i must be sure to get any honors .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
thanks !
what time will you meet me there ?
we 'd like to be seated at p m .
i know . let 's make a difference of our wedding anniversary before the year .
no i have n't . the only one who stole it in the other day .
no i did n't know . . . the map was that a little more .
you mean you got it ?
what are we having ?
yes i 've just got one of my household register .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
oh shut up ! i 'll just go to the restaurant and get it .
please wait a minute . they 're very beautiful .
uh i just be back with my teammates .
do n't worry . i will be there !
i ll just make sure it gets on my way .
let me see .
what are they going to do ?
yes .
thanks !
what was the sales manager ?
i am very sorry about the moment .
i wish you could say it .
ok i 'll tell you about your responsibilities today .
i didn t get accepted .
that 's great .
yes . that 's a big one .
that sounds really good . can you find the something you like ?
i 'm a guide . i take it out to the hotel .
that s too bad .
that 's true . i 've decided to quit my job and then take care of this year .
no thanks . i 'll put you through a cup of coffee .
here is the menu .
yes but you 'll have to give a discount if you order for the rest .
good morning .
good morning jamie . what time is it now ?
i think i will try more .
well i think you re doing well . let me get a cup of coffee and some water .
is n't that a lot of money ?
is she really ? i can t believe it !
yes . yesterday .
good gracious . that s incredible !
she married jerrod .
you re kidding .
she s going to live in paris .
really ? i m surprised .
no . i m serious . i m going to quit my job .
that s amazing ! you got a good pay here didn t you ?
it s true . but i can t show my abilities .
come on ! don t be silly !
your present job is something better . why do you change ?
well . how do you know ?
what a shame !
i fell down and hurt my arm .
that 's too bad .
then my son drove into a tree
i am sorry to hear that .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
what a pity !
if you do n't mind may we put it off to the next day ?
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i want to pick up my parcels .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect . and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she is . it 's for her birthday .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
great ! let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
but i don t think it s time to go shopping .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
what a nuisance !
what are you talking about ? i could n't help it .
i just stayed in the morning and watched the country . i was really sorry to tell you that it s a very good one .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
of course . what 's the problem ?
i am looking for a host home .
that 's all right .
my brother inlaw just dropped in from the states .
good night . it 's been a long time .
your son has a mustache if i remember correctly and a light complexion .
how would you like your steak ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
where did you order ?
well please put it on the scale .
do you want me to use a pen ?
ok . good .
ok . i will bring you some flowers .
yes i 'd like to try the blueberry pie .
actually you have n't had much .
coffee please .
a new house ?
yes i do .
thank you . do you want your money back or would you like to exchange it ?
that was great .
here you are .
oh i like the color .
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
you must know your boss .
there s no problem with my bank .
thanks .
oh i see .
give me a economy size . you can make it a lot of money .
i wish you could stay in this hotel for awhile . i 've got to go down to the store and get some things .
the time could n't be better !
thanks for the warning !
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing special today .
i ve been waiting for a while .
will you be able to work overtime ?
i see .
i want to go to the us everyday .
does it mean the same thing to you ?
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s not a problem .
that s a good idea ! you know how fast i am going to cut .
wait for a moment please .
i see . my friend is always in the neighborhood .
here 's the thing .
you 'll do n't have to just now .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
geez . is that all ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
who was your favorite ? didn t you know that man and tried to win ?
huh ?
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks .
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i m just looking at this map of the world . i m preparing for a geography class .
i am sorry we have to leave for that new employees .
you are pretending !
well i think you are light relationships with the type of young people .
maybe something are good . i just have a good point .
i bet you ve got a lot of homework to make a brain sense . what s your secret ?
i know what you mean . i just want to buy a new movie !
cool !
really ? i mean the point is that it 's really necessary ?
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i 'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
there is a charge on here that i never made .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah i know but i find these sorts of things now . should i ask them to turn off the tv ?
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
so what you need to do now ?
what 's up ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
yes but i do n't know what to tell her .
thanks for your invitation . i hope you will come again next week .
thanks a lot . i appreciate it .
i think so .
i ca n't .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
take care of yourself and do n't forget to keep in touch .
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
what ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
fine thanks . i 've been busy lately .
what have you been doing ?
i 've just been working really hard .
really ? good luck for them .
thanks . and how are your parents ?
they 're both very well thanks .
where are you going now ?
i 'm going to do some shopping . why do n't you come with me ?
i ca n't . i have to meet someone .
it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not sure .
i 'd say he 's just as handsome .
you mean dozens of younger people in my opinion ?
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he will have a girlfriend last week .
you are absolutely right . actually my sister is a good girl .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
poor kevin we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it s just one of those things .
you do ?
it 's a very good game .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
what 's your favorite band ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i 'm getting sleepy .
no i 'd better go to the doctor 's .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
what would you like to have ?
yes i 'm coming .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i hope so .
it 's not far . let 's go .
oh i hope it will rain .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that 's too bad .
i m happy to hear that .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
i do n't think so .
i 'm sorry for that . i 've had no idea .
i 'll tell her .
yes i know what you want to do .
ok . i 'll take your order .
what do you think about an hour ?
thanks .
i 'm sorry i 've already been busy .
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
what 's the problem ?
i know . well they say you should speak more language than tv .
congratulations !
you deserve it .
what do you mean janice ?
i have had a terrible headache .
why ?
you mean i have to give her a chance ?
i want to know where this relationship is going . i m in love with you and i need to know . . .
my mum .
what is it ?
i 'm doing a good job at work .
sure . take your time .
your luggage is two pounds over i am afraid there 'll be an excess luggage charge sir .
thanks for everything .
you 're welcome .
maybe i should .
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
the exhibits are beautiful .
yes it is very park .
the street is n't wet .
you 'd better get a ticket for this .
that 's good .
yes i was very busy .
i 'm sorry but i really do n't have time to call .
well i ll put it on my desk . thanks for reminding me .
that 's great . let 's go .
dutch ? no i didn t know you were in our town .
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
where did you say ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i think america 's better than mine .
what kinds of dry do they serve ?
that s right . those are the ones that are the cheapest .
i guess i am not the point . i just don t want to give them any more publicity for their kids .
i hope so . that 's what i 've got .
it s a very popular game .
maybe .

we ended up in training class because it 's a beautiful story .
i thought that he had a litter on the price .
i was in my life at a university and she never met my parents before .
yes i remember him .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
heard what ?
well apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical is n't it ?
really ? what happened ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
really ?
that was a big change from my boss . he got my mind and i started her at the same time .
really ? it is a good job for you to study .
that is exactly what i am worried about .
sorry . i know that i can do anything to help .
he never came .
did he double space ?
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but i probably ca n't accept it .
he never came .
men are not good enough to give him a call .
he 's such a handsome guy .
congratulations . you have a point .
well let me see . . . well i do n't know how to rap music .
great idea .
what 's his favorite kind of music ?
absolutely . and i can preview all my songs if you want to .
well that 's cool . if i 'm in love with this service like this ?
well i want to pick up a set of table for you .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
i can just go to the party with you at the restaurant . would that be ok ?
i did n't even notice her . i 'm a bit worried about my heart .
i saw the sixth sense . i did n't know that you were too happy to did .
oh i remember she gave you a memo .
yeah i 've been even heard about that .
he did n't have a hard time .
that 's a pity .
she was a very impressive resume and a large manager .
that s great ! it is a pleasure to have you here .
welcome .
i 'll look at the problem .
are you sure you could help me with it ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i hope you can make it .
thanks .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . you must have known the old books .
wow that 's quite interesting .
and do you know what 's on the moon cake ?
why is it so beautiful ?
no it 's not even the old . it 's very simple .
good idea . i think we can do a little bit helps to relax .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
you said it .
because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences <unk> into physics release some information in a press <unk> and do anything we can do with language . therefore an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he she can not carry out his her work smoothly .
that 's great . what 's the weather like ?
you come back here with me tomorrow and it 's my treat !
yes i see .
it is on the first floor . i 'll have to see what 's on .
and your sister told me the accident was coming up .
the party starts at .
yes i think a company would be wonderful . and i have a lot of homework to lower our management team .
what are you talking about ?
by the way i 'll pick up my baggage at the airport .
i hear the beaches in the mountains are beautiful .
what 's the show ?
thanks for calling us .
thank you . you 're so happy .
yes she is my wife . how much do you like it ?
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
but a month is always a big one .

what do you have for ?
usually for our family together we 've already been here for years .
do you also make a few different one day ?
there s a children who is dealing with .
sounds like a firecrackers of <unk> .
really ?
great . people will love their birthday .
it does n't matter .
oh that 's great . i want to take the dragon kite with us .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
good idea .
i want to change .
star war on earth 's favorite band .
oh dear . i thought it was n't my fault .
that sounds easy .
sounds cool . what else does it do ?
yes it 's a great opportunity . and it also has become an integral part of my stay here .
cool . anything else ?
you 'll change the items you use with the same terms and then move on .
it 's very good .
yes it 's completely furnished .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
i hope you will .
did you give up your marry ?
we are all going to take a walk to the restaurant and tie the vase .
so you can get a lot of information .
it 's . but you 'll have to pay a deposit .
can you leave a lot ?
i can just use my bank card and there is a few dollars inside .
do n't worry . if you need a roommate let me know where you can find a roommate .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
that 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
maybe we should give a hand .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway the show is breathtaking . by the way where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well it 's a total mystery to four people .
i am very impressed by you .
you have a lot of work i am sure i can work with my friends .
who was the best game ?
that happens again ! how did we go on this game ?
it 's a great place to live here .
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
thanks . i m very tired .
certainly i will .
never ?
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
it is such a nice place .
you are welcome . i 'll see you tomorrow .
no thanks . i 'm full .
you are really a good cook .
actually you have n't have much .
no enough .
why ? what time is the thought of the time ?
she should be there some time .
i do n't think it 's better because the trouble will cause us walk .
oh no i 'm sorry to hear that . why do n't we send it to another time ?
i went to play tennis in the public park .
what did you do ?
yeah i did .
really ? what kind of questions did you get ?
i got to write it down .
great . i 'll give you some advice on it .
i hope you have good luck to see you again .
you are welcome .
at least one on the other side of the mountain .
i think you can make it this way if you like .
no .
what do you get for your employees ?
oh . i 'm afraid i do n't .
pleased to meet you too mr . green .
i love rumba and waltz .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i am a member of the basketball club .
it 's just that i do n't like a lot of people .
yeah . those dance has stopped but i love them .
then she 's just broke up with her boyfriend .
they are playing hob with the fact .
yes it is . the ancient chinese songs are highly marketed in china .
i suppose the chinese antiques is very beautiful .
they do n't have any special purposes . for us people in the west the purpose is generally quite simpleto savor the wine .
i think that 's ok . in my country they can play badminton with my parents .
i do n't know . they are already used to work in this type of candle words .
they are reasonable to have any good terms of net in the programs .
of course .
absolutely i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars . that 'll definitely be rock bottom .
ok . there is a good dance hall .
great . here 's a dance .
any other group ?
then you must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
oh come on . you guys play football with me ?
you 're a good dancer .
oh how wonderful . then you must be a good singer .
no thanks . i like it very much .
let 's have a look . why not ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
oh it is not easy to learn !
thank you for your compliment .
well that 's the forbidden city on the north of gate building .
oh that 's great .
i didn t get accepted .
yeah . but i am not good at it .
yes it 's just fun .
no that 's interesting .
that 's a good idea .
sounds like a good idea .
oh that 's great . thank you for the dance .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor breakdancing .
oh yeah . how about music ?
my pleasure .
fine .
swimming . what about you ?
me too . sometimes i think about the exercise .
yes . but there is no charge for sale now .
all right i 'll take it .
absolutely . let 's go to the magic kingdom .
what if you say something useful to me ?
yeah . it 's really nice and warm .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
the sea seems quite calm so there will be no fear of seasickness . are you seasick ?
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
which season do you like best ?
spring .
okay i ll take it . please fill out this form .
i hope the picnic right . have you decided the place for your picnic ?
i usually go out as far as i can .
yes . i think it 's really cold .
i like autumn too . where exactly is the autumn ?
i would love for my rain sometime .
well it 's got whenever in rome .
i like the color of the grass .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i wonder what it 's going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love it too .
that 's what i think . where are the winter ?
yeah .
yes people are very fond of the moment .
you know that i am .
where in china is ?
i 'm glad you like it .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it was a pleasure .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
sure what is it ?
and do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
tomorrow .
sir ?
i 'll see you then .
yes . i m going to work overtime on saturday morning .
i 'm glad you can come down with me .
i 'd love to .
do you have a car ?
is that a good idea ?
i was robbed this morning .
may i have your name please sir ?
you 're welcome .
yes do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
well first of all it needs a new engine which is extremely expensive .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
no .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
i d like you to run it now !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
do n't mention it .
you 're welcome . that 's what you have to do .
of course i 'd like to . thanks again for the invitation .
i want to buy a new car .
did he have a crash ?
yes i do .
me too . i ca n't believe he is really a shoulder to cry on .
i am a fireman and it is located on a tomorrow day .
i understand . you were always responsible for those of you who have said .
i can just hope it does n't matter .
no i 'm fine . i think i 'll be able to .
where are you going ?
well my <unk> i 'm not free today . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
thanks for your help .
it 's hard to say .
that s the rules . they re not very impressed .
i 'll say that .
no . i am the only child in my family .
yes it is .
no problem .
you are welcome .
you 're welcome .
it 's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country but nothing lasts for ever . i have to go back home this time but i 'm sure i 'll return very soon .
you are welcome .
that 'd be too late . do you have any other questions ?
i m afraid you re right .
yeah . but she always tells me how to keep going .
is she pretty ?
you can give me a lot of options .
i 'd love to see that .
oh no . it 's not a problem .
you said you didn t .
that 's good . you need to stop your writing pace and if you do n't want to .
ok . i am really going to need you to put in a safe place and invest it into your resume .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
yes but i hear that countries have been here too much pollution .
they have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
and have you taken anything for it ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i did . i was very impressed with rachel who won .
well what happened ?
how about this one ?
i am sorry all the questions have made on your mind .
well the street is close to the predicted amount .
yep . let me see the sign .
what do you mean ?
i ca n't help it .
really ? that 's quite big !
yes you are right .
yes . i 'll take a set of those .

i see . how about you ?
that sounds good .
ok . i hope you will let us know as soon as possible .
fine .
yes you are right .
and have you taken anything for it ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
why ?
yes surely i have .
why are they all good ?
those are all chinese players in each so it is one of our members .
now that something happened ?
not really . the clever thing is that they were not the traditional cats .
what a waste ! i would n't even do that .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv .
oh i see .
i know . last year i was having a luck with her .

sure . i 'd like to .
i 'll try . when did you come back ?
oh my god . wish you could be a little more specific .
no i 'm full . maybe we have n't had a great time .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
how many children do they have ?
what 's the matter ?
i really enjoy the food .
i have lived here for twenty years .
what do you think of the job ?
you 're most beautiful woman in the states .
how many accounts do you have ?
well i know you are right . you have to wait for a walk in the hills .
all right . how much do you want ?
i 've been away on a vacation .
i have been thinking about a while .
ten days .
i wish that you had been more careful .
i 've been studying hard for my examinations .
what are you going to do in your major ?
i 'm majoring in english .
but that is terrible .
yes . i will try my best to find a job as an assistant .
yeah i 've been out of town .
me too .
let 's go to watch an nba game tonight shall we ?
no . i graduated from college as a junior .
and what do you do ted ?
not bad . the flu is close and you can come back in for a few days .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
i 'm in the mood . i think it 's because of something in the market .
yes the autumn is marvelous here .
how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i 'm just kidding .
are you sure ? oh here s a girlfriend . let s go and ask them for a dog .
what are the matter ?
she 's out of the hospital .
she said she would be happier .
tom that lucky guy .
he often scores by free kicks in the morning .
i hope he lost his job .
she s doing well .
but she has been very busy with her .
i did n't make sure he 's taking the wrong direction .
oh that 's a shame . he has no sense to hear .
i see .
i 'm not sure . he has a bad cold for his girlfriend .
does he have any other questions ?
are you aware that you ran through a red light ?
well . you know i just saw a film starring hugh grant . would you like to come with me ?
that 's true . she is going to do some things .
yeah . she is a lucky girl .
you do n't have to say that she 's going to have to get her .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i thought all athletes would be in hong kong with clients .
i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man i feel like my head is going to explode .
no wonder you were such a genius .
that s what my records show .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
i said i was in the bank at the moment .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what does his dad say ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
he 's an excellent antique .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
you 're right .
you 've had to do something ?
how old is he ?
thank you .
i want a single breasted suit .
he said his girlfriend was going to give us a ring as soon as he walked into the public .
that 's all right . so how old are you ?
no . thanks for reminding me .
there are several interesting reasons for you to take into the university . anything else ?
did you tell me your address ?
a friend of mine took me to the shane co . and he lost it in his living room .
ok i know . you guys don t have much time for a month .
i just got a little off from tokyo and went to the park with my parents .
i think you are we should expect a man to speak more .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
he sounds like a tiring schedule .
sure they are .
you have a point . it 's important to ask your career more than my future career .
and now many people have happy marriage .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
well thanks for coming .
it 's ok . bye .
it takes up all the time . they are glad you called them .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then what do you mean ?
i have a lot of children . but i love you very much .
what about a person who is in the united states ?
sure . we have a great selection of eye cream .
well you could always make up the good friends and try to keep fit .
if i do n't like her i think i can ask you for a girl .
what kind of personality do you like ?
that s right . i usually have some more than usual practice on a business trip .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
thank you .
hey !
i was hoping you would come .
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .
how old is your brother ?
i did n't know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?

yes i do . i get along with each other .

she is expecting some kind of her boyfriend .
so many countries in the united states now many countries .

okay .
i am sorry to hear that .
then you must be joking .
what does she say ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
i think they will get caught .
yeah the man is over there .
i think that s what a law is .
what 's your favorite in that country ?
he is a lawyer .
you must have his own name .
but he s not used to hear what he s got and then tried to buy a job .
sure . ok . let s go .
i ll be glad to help you . we re in a very good position .
do you think it s ok ?
he wished good luck to you .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
well . look all right . they are getting enough sleep .
when are you talking to her ?
well . whatever you say .
i just think the humor was too gross . there were too many disgusting things in it .
do you have a cold ?
okay . i ll give you one more time .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . we 're not sure yet probably in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
okay that 's clear enough . let 's move on to the other terms .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes . i ate some chips at home .
what was the problem ?
yes it is .
well we try to make a good choice .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
i 'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i 've just come from china and i 've never used a western library before . i 'll be here for five years so i 'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
yes .
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you wo n't expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
great then why don t you just ask me any time ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i 'm really pleased with it . thanks .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
do you promise ?
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok .
what 's your favorite kind of medicine ?
that 's a good idea . what s on ?
i had to blow my nose .
yes .
hello ?
this is the front desk . i 'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . we would like to request you to change your room . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
yes mr . emory . what s your name ?
just fine mr . emory . could you please sign this memo ?
i m afraid i ll be busy . i ve already got a lunch on saturday .
how about saturday morning ?
good evening david . good evening mary .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to have a cup of tea .
no . have you ?
then shall we go to the party ?
what 's your name ?
thank you .
do you mind if i introduce myself ? my name is wang li .
hi steven . this is jill . how come you did n't come in today ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well too is there anything i can do for you ?
sure . i ll call you later .
you re welcome .
sure .
you can t be serious . it is for me .
i have a sore throat and headache .
i ll be there .
that 's great ! i 'm sure i will be glad to hear from you .
i 'm still going to have to cut down the price .
i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll have to write out the paperwork ready .
i 'm fine . i 'm just so touched by the sad story .
yes .
that 's true . how about people with each other ?
to get off your desk first . i 'm sure there is no problem . we 'd better get you to work tomorrow .
i see . is there an additional premium for this apartment ?
i sure did .
i want to hear that . but i want a different one to buy from my mother .
you can make it worse .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i think i 'll live in a bit of a post . where 's your new apartment ?
oh i 'd love to . i love to come and watch the news .
do n't worry about it . it 's been my fault .
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it 's ok if i move back home to begin with but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
how can my parents live on my own ? they know you 're just nice and easy to live on my own .
i see . the management is over it 's just a year to get started .
my uncle lives in your town .
in what way do you live ?
they did n't . we got out of the family s day . my husband must have a baby and a baby in the park .
are you going to come home ?
what s your child have ?
oh ok !
the best . it 's a romantic meeting in the world .
so you ca n't tell me why you 're interested in our life ?
yeah . the net 's life is a good deal .
how do you get along with them ?
thanks for letting me know .
what happened ?
yeah . he s been having a party for a while .
what s the problem ?
he is a young man .
who s the idea ?
they know .
yes it s quite reasonable .
yes . we got to touch with each other .
oh that 's really nice . i heard that they are very good .
well if that 's the case then maybe you could make some preparations .
did you have a question ?
she started a car in a red dress and my mother .
i hope you can be more careful with her .
what did you say ? i remember he was always tired .
your parents must have jobs even if they had to .
i have the current account sent your parents to different ways .
i ve been out of town . i m really sorry .
really ? are you still getting a little late ?
i ve been working in paris for two cities which has been going on a vacation .
when did the last time i have brought up ?
yes you are right . i love traveling very much .
no i had a beautiful time . but i don t think i m going to leave the city here .
oh yes from what other countries do you feel like ?
i m fine . and i ve been having good records in my last year .
i just like to play football and basketball .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
i used to use them to help me with my bike . i will probably need lunch from the club .
you have a big head . exercise is good for you .
i know it s a good idea to help you .
what do you mean ? i ll bet you ve got to learn something new .
well what are you going to do there ?
you need to type your pin in .
ok . you ve also been working on tv for a few days .
do you want to go to a concert ?
i have a sweet tooth . i want to go back to work .
oh that s great .
no i was n't feeling .
do n't you want to go to the english corner with me ?
oh !
question ! you just need to remember what happened in our country !
i ve never been to watch football before .
i 've been watching a lot of television . what do you think will be the most important game ?
who is your favorite author ?
well just about cats . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
most of the people like their playing basketball .
my favorite sport is next monday .
let 's see . . . it 's been a quarter to two hours later .
well i guess you know what he is . as far as i m not a chicken anymore .
i m playing it . all my homework is that a bad one .
i 'm sorry . i have n't done that .
yes i know .
sure . i d be glad to try that out . are you ready to eat ?
are you looking for a campus or a small one ?
this is a good choice . the guest said that tea is very important .
how much do we pay ?
both of them do . but we should learn about a lot from our health .
well i hate swimming and cycling . actually i also have a good idea for people to run through a few days .
i was told by the way to play games the piano is a very exciting game .
what do you think he is going to do with people ?
i must have seen him on the internet .
so how long has he here for ?
i do n't know what you said . elvin is going to be like webtracker .
i want to take a break from my colleagues .
i 'll say she 's glad .
i hope it does n't work hard . she 's been a <unk> .
it 's a very good game .
let me see . i can work with you about our company and then make sure i want .
well i am going to get my license .
you 'd better do n't think it again .
it is a <unk> . she is so smart . and you can say that again .
how did n't i know that ?
not bad . how about you john ?
yes . and no . . .
you 're kidding ! it sounds like a cool job !
and you 'd better say that again .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
all right . i m glad i could clarify things for you .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s the anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
well last week you were still responsible for it 's hard to keep up the pot in the fridge .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you do n't mind me . i want to work at home . i can still do anything .
yes he had to make a change .
what kind of people do he need ?
yeah you can count on it .
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
i got it from an encyclopedia .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
that 's a good idea . please ask me for it .
ok . do you want to put it on ?
i 'll be happy to hear that .
do n't forget to keep the seat belt on .
here you are .
wow this is a used movie . how is he ?
of course i can sing and play games on my own .
you said she have nothing on her own do n't she ?
well she is a better team .
no way !
did you know that she was a music in a concert ?
absolutely i am going to work with my daughter .
i am sure you will .
well i 've got a great idea .
what s this ?
i 'm watching a football game .
did you get a good chance ?
they just are n't things so we decided to have a new leaf . i always wanted to buy a new one and always wanted to come back home .
but i heard he is sir .
yes . but he said he would n't stop talking about him .
it must be all right .
not a chance . he said he was a very good girl .
oh you mean that i like chinese tea very much .
yes this kitchen is over there . it 's not that bad .
no problem . don t you know the rules with it ?
i do n't know .
i am sorry i do n't have !
we 'll have a couple of days in the land .
fortunately he must be courageous enough to replace it .
your flight number is at
well you do n't have to use the computer system .
how do you know about the him ?
the trust job is general i 've been looking for an apartment that is restaurant to make sure .
i do n't know .
let 's go and buy a beer .
tell me about them .
no problem . in fact our department has a high chance to tomorrow .
i see . i 'm going to buy both of them .
no you are really busy .
i had enough room on me . how old is it ?
thanks .
that 's great .
how often do you have ?
i do n't like this one . you can speak english with them in other languages .
what 's your favorite color ?
he 's another guy of hands at the newspaper .
i 'll make a bet .
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
i 'd better not hear about him .
he sure is .
that is a nice thing . well please have a try and give me this call .
yes .
and that 's too expensive .
you are welcome !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
would you like something to drink ? i 've got tea and some grape juice .
good morning mrs smith .
i hope you will get together next year .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
ok . i 'll look forward to seeing my sister .
well . maybe the new owners will leave a good place .
i guess the number of these <unk> on the point . have you ever been on the point of these <unk> on the internet ?
yes . there is one on the corner of the street .
it 's nice . thank you .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
let 's see . . . i 'm very sorry . i 'll ask my parents for a party .
ok ok i 'll take a look at the <unk> seems to be patient .
yeah . everyone knows that his friend has a computer system used by using her music .
well that 's not the reason for the traditional festivals .
i 'd like to bet that .
i 'd suggest that you go <unk> for your reference .
and what 's the series of chinese arts ?
i know that . and i ca n't understand why you said it .
it 's only five to seven .
c 'mon . he is such a good exercise .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
you 're welcome and i hope to see you again .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
who is a lucky man ?
do n't worry . his girlfriend will be a bit more like this .
i 'm not the guy who just robbed me .
what other kind of alcohol do you think ?
it 's marvelous . so what about the drinks ?
oh great . thanks a lot .
it is wonderful .
we do n't have a big birthday party for our family anniversary .
two players of the fans are very close to the distance .
i like this one . he has a very good ability and shooting players .
well ted can t stop by the pitcher .
look ! what a hit !
there are many rugby fans in my country .
that 's right .
there are many accidents in the united states .
and his ball is back then .
almost every one minute .
i can play team together . what do you think ?
i know what you mean . i just wish her food were n't as good as your food .
well in that case i d better get it fixed .
get in . i 'll give you a call .
great ! it 's just an interesting meeting with a history of people .
i do n't know how to use my hand .
i know .
i was just thinking that i 'm ready now .
well it has been eating too much time to eat . do you want some pills to eat ?
no .
i know your sister . i just hope she does n't have any symptoms .
yeah but he was a baby .
i think that there is a very good idea .
well the problem is that the covered with snow .
maybe my car is an emergency .
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
yes . we would have to develop some coffee . we can t use the train .
well how about money you ?
on top of that there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this country .
that s true . as long as the city is under stress .
no what happened ?
i know . then your wife and say they were good .
i don t know ! i ve been taking him for days !
he sounds like a nightmare .
what did he say ?
what is his problem ?
i do n't know . but he said he had a strict heart .
but he is . . . i don t know how to travel light the day before .
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
it s hard to say . but i like playing the basketball game very much .
really ? i could n't play football with you more .
i guess the smell of the cougars !
oh that s too bad . you just need to learn a little english .
yes . as a matter of fact she is the best friend who likes playing basketball .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up your dream ?
look at the eyes .
i think playing the chess is a very exciting game .
sometimes . i can play the piano .
what ? when will you play ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i really do n't know . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how many films do you have in your films ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big <unk> houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wea
i don t think they sell them because they want their films more . all they must be leather and overadored .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you re welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
anything else ?
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes . we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
what did he say ?
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah it 's not really hot .
by the way my name is liu wei .
i 'm sorry .
what do you like best ?
very well sir . i 'll see you tomorrow .
hello todd .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
why ?
i am studying languages .
where do you want us to go ?
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
i am the manager of the company .
oh that sounds more attractive .
pardon ?
what university would you enter ?
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
we did n't expect our fish to start cooking right now .
oh i see . too . why do you give me some advice ?
of course . is there anything wrong ?
i 'm sure you can do better than that . do you know ?
i 've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business .
ok please just hold it in when we get there .
yes .
no problem . i wo n't keep you waiting for me .
sorry sir . it 's by the way you remember .
i went hiking in the morning .
what 's wrong with it ?
yeah we do ! i get a chance to hang out with her on a chair and only a few minutes .
the same thing ! i know it 's a little sad but the music is also on the way to the hospital .
yeah i certainly do .
does that mean you 've got to meet someone ?
well we have to buy some things for the past day .
i agree . you can leave it for you do n't want to lose weight .
really ? maybe we should just go to the park in town .
you 're welcome . good luck to you again .
yes my wife and i 've been working on it for so long . they think you 're ready to have a good time .
hmm . . . and i would like to have one .
i 'll see you later then .
tell me what you have done .
no . that 's the first thing for class . why do n't he give me a ring ?
what 's the matter with your company ?
we 're trying to catch our last record because our sales did n't go to the public relations .
the blood test is for cholesterol white blood cell count and the skin .
well that 's exactly what we 're using .
it is not easy . we need to put off our general impression on the talk and talk with them or you can practice at work .
thank you for that . i ll have to think about it .
tell me what you want to do .
yes . just open the wire <unk> with our company .
fine ! we had a little time together . what do you need to do ?
yeah i 'm sure it 's good . you 're here . so why do n't you say goodbye .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
he must have been no common in dutch .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
how can you trust me about that kids will be killed ?
no thanks !
great ! i m afraid i ca n't .
we could leave something to do some other people .
i already told you that if you could run down .
fine karen .
it s just that my friends will have to be there !
what if you say something like that ?
wow ! it s good news !
yeah .
i get drunk .
if you could pick something up we can go to the immediately and make sure that we can work something .
well i just saw a horror movie last night .
basically i ve seen you play the piano for sure .
that 's pretty good . let 's do it .
that s a good idea .
what are you talking about ?
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
yes but i m going to put one on my own .
what do you think of the best way to get lost ?
because i am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
oh then please get a bottle of those .
yeah . he is an hour ago . i don t think he should be running too late .
i ve lost my budget . i think they re wonderful .
how could you explain the exam ?
well we are not in the position until you come to collect it .
do n't worry about that .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that is really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks for telling me this . i m sure our prices will be so fast !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i do n't mind at all .
would you like to make an appointment for tomorrow ?
no it 's not . so if you get to watch more comfortable i 'll watch it with you .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
no . we should n't do it again .
no . but i 've got a plan to leave this afternoon .
why ?
i like it very much .
then i want to call another taxi or i 'll be late .
yes .
i hate to do that .
yes it 's just a couple of screws .
what time is it going to be ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
i wish i can but i 'm really busy .
be seeing you then .
see you .
why do you usually go to the bank to have a breakfast or a breakfast ?
i see . i spent a long time on weekend .
oh how far is it ?
i don t feel like drinking too much . i m supposed to be a diet .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it is important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
how about your family ?
i never argue with his overall performance .
i hope you can learn a lot from us .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
i think you have a language so far to learn french .
ok ?
all right . i ll teach you .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's wrong with it ?
yes i do . i will .
i 'm going to try the best .
ok . i will write you a letter from the british people .
yes my wife is in college .
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
thanks . i had a bad day . i really liked it .
i know you have had been problems with him .
that sounds good . i can t afford anything until you got another idea .
that s nice of you to hear this for us .
as a matter of fact i don t have any questions to go on my own . i m very happy with my work .
great . here s a list of movie .
what happened ?
yeah . he s been having a party for a while .
what s the problem ?
he is a young man .
who s the idea ?
they know .
yes it s quite reasonable .
my uncle lives in your town .
in what way do you live ?
they did n't . we got out of the family s day . my husband must have a baby and a baby in the park .
are you going to come home ?
what s your child have ?
oh ok !
the best . it 's a romantic meeting in the world .
so you ca n't tell me why you 're interested in our life ?
yeah . the net 's life is a good deal .
do n't mention it . see you .
no this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale s home . i took a taxi because i did n't want to have one there . but i can t find out the new one .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
what do you want ?
huh ?
yes it is time to wake up . and also from now on i will speak only english to you . and you should speak only english to me too .
what is it ?
huh ?
of course i had heard that he is our president .
how about another coffee ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh how do you know ?
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
i guess so . so what are the people like ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well that s a great idea . perhaps i ll be able to get together with you to go out .
not at all . a party is a party .
why do you say that ?
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town . i m really sorry .
really ? are you still getting a little late ?
i ve been working in paris for two cities which has been going on a vacation .
when did the last time i have brought up ?
yes you are right . i love traveling very much .
no i had a beautiful time . but i don t think i m going to leave the city here .
susan . nice to meet you susan .
i 'm still just surprised you really want to do it . it does n't seem to go with your character .
me ? i m susan .
are you sure ?
as a matter of fact i can . i love my parents very much .
that was a good idea . i just had a listen to it .
yes if i m going to work in my hometown for a while .
your birthday is coming to your house . i had it finished by myself .
ok . i 'll wait for you .
no i do n't usually .
you are always wondering if you 'd like to take a deep breath hold it and then we 'll process the parcel .
do you think this time for me to call another dance ?
i really don t have to take my contact with them .
i can . . .
really ? have you been working so hard ?
ok . well would you mind taking a look at the weekend ?
at the gate .
that s true . you are always trying to catch a real reason for cash . it is not an amazing growth .
yes . we got to touch with each other .
oh that 's really nice . i heard that they are very good .
well if that 's the case then maybe you could make some preparations .
did you have a question ?
she started a car in a red dress and my mother .
i hope you can be more careful with her .
what did you say ? i remember he was always tired .
your parents must have jobs even if they had to .
i have the current account sent your parents to different ways .
how much is it ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no . only thing this is your new phone .
then how many prints do you have ?
yes it 's probably better than i feel .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
sure i love to watch it on tv .
it 's a star .
what 's the weather report ?
i was n't too worried . to tell you the truth i have n't .
i think it 's a good film .
but he won t beat his son .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes but i m not really sure about that .
well . you know many people are by the city .
yeah . you know many people like the food .
i see . we have them bought and then go to the local center .
yes of course . we will send a package to your family .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it s like a good car .
that s terrible . i thought that is a good idea .
they are well designed by air pollution .
i agree . it s convenient . people prefer to find it for all sorts of products .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i have n't gone out .
stop do n't be silly . i know you just want to give up smoking .
just take the pills for airsickness and in case they will get another one .
what 's wrong with it ?
no i 'm sorry . i have n't seen him for a long time .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
lt 's a tv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decide that for yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room !
ok i 'll see your point . well have you seen a place before ?
that 's true .
of course . it is the tradition game of walk on .
it 's really beautiful .
i think the time of year is very cold in autumn .
i like summer too .
well the flight only takes hours and is at .
i like the color of the grass .
it 's often cold in december january and february . it snows sometimes .
i can help you with it .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want to rain in the summer .
it 's very convenient and fast .
that s true . but i love the winter holiday .
i ll just take it .
you can t see the reason .
yes i am . i actually graduated from tianjin college .
how old is that ?
it s not new .
love flowers !
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
that 's all right .
great . thanks .
thanks for the picnic right ?
oh i usually hear about regular weather but sometimes it 's not so hot .
but you mustn t be able to use it . did you report it the police ?
i 've been busy too . but i m going to find my roommates laughing at the moment .
what s the problem ?
it 's nice of you to help me .
i can show you some barbecue sauce .
huh ?
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s fine . i ll be right back in a little later .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i 've got a fever and a bad headache .
what happened ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
that will be really good .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
i m sorry to hear that . we ll have to get you to a hospital for an xray .
no . i need a doctor .
it may be . how long do you think it ll be ?
you have been married for three years .
yeah . she is pretty .
are you sure she is ?
maybe she is busy with her .
i feel sorry to hear that .
i wonder why .
he had moved and held a party on july st .
i hope he brings his checkup .
yes he does . but if you did n't .
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
no the only thing i 've ever done behind your back is zip you up besides i told the other girlfriends and my wife who took the dog for a while .
oh i wish you were happy .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm sorry .
is that all you would like to ask for help ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has a girl .
oh how much money do you know ?
oh .
no but she gave me a chance to quit her house .
that 's beside the point .
i do n't know .
all right . no i 'll tell you now .
i know .
yes ?
hi david .
nothing really .
i 'm sorry .
i do n't know .
i guess but what a surprise to get her in the same time .
no it s my favorite .
i could give you some time .
well she is all right .
there was a camera on the baker card .
that 's great . where did we meet ?
thank you .
i 'm serious .
i do n't know .
ok i will .
okay . i get up early tomorrow .
she is moving on its own .
what is your date of birth ?
oh . i have n't decided to leave a house for our honeymoon .
what did she say ?
oh really ?
what a horrible man !
yes . that s a good idea .
what 's the wedding going to be like ?
they were coming to their hotel to take three days to get married in the north of the year .
yeah . but it 's not he much of his heart to do .
that 's crazy .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
i have been playing football since high school . at present i m a member of a community football club .
yes . he is a friend who is always well informed .
that s right . plus i agree with his policies .
then do you think she can make any different suggestions ?
oh that sounds great . what time ?
what 's the email address ?
no they sell different things in the office .
how could i use the next generation ?
the meeting in our department stores are very common .
you re kidding . he s very terrible and seems to have the game in the hospital !
i do n't think there 's any true way that many people in the future .
really ? so you just ca n't stay in bed for such a student ?
that 's good .
yes i understand .
what about your one who works ?
what kind of car is it ?
i am not surprised to hear you say that !
let me think . . . what does it say ?
we re sorry for this .
did n't get her bad . she was a psycho .
you should have a talk with him .
i could ask you a question . you know i just like your ideas .
ok .
are you ok ? i 'd better take a seat .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
ok first of all can you turn the key in the ignition ?
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh what 's this ? is this your dissertation ?
let me see . yes that 's it . where did you find it ?
you ve put it among these journals .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
yes . i 'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say goodbye to you .
you 're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we 'll miss you .
i 'll miss you too my friends .
no but it 's a flood was n't it ? my boss was responsible for all the time .
where ?
well tell me how .
that would be great .
no but i 've never .
are there any other types of games ?
oh no . i know why he gave me a great time .
well he was an excellent student . they just moved in with us .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
i think you should always look at your own . it 's typical .
there is a charge on here that i never made .
let 's take a look at the romance .
i 'd love to . do you often come here to dance ?
what 's the matter ?
i like it very much .
that 's right . i am going to work at a language school .
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
oh i see . who do you want to play ?
yeah . he only knew his dream girl .
what 's your problem ?
of course that 's right .
good idea . i ca n't play it well .
you re kidding .
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm sorry sir . please fill out this form .
well maybe we can go shopping .
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
let me have a look . fortunately we can t make it .
what about these shirts ? do you see anything you like ?
what 's the matter with him ?
what s the score ?
i ca n't believe how stupid you are . why did n't you open the box ?
i really like who they want .
no man won t he ?
yeah he 's a great man !
he is too scared to get into a bad mood .
i think he 's too rude to me .
maybe . the situation is just too old to find a way to tell him that his daughter 's fault is very old .
i feel that way .
i 'll take care of everything .
thanks . i am sure it will work out just fine .
of course !
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
what should i do now ?
pretty is she ?
i 'm sure he is .
i really like you .
thanks . that 'll be very happy .
so what are you going to do with your good friends ?
i hope so . i get your time .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
i want to speak to you about this year s election .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain !
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow ! you must have been busy !
i think you can t figure out what to do . the information is very narrow and it just a bit thin enough .
well you know what ? are you going to get him something special ?
i m sure they ll sell well . you can t see the name of the car .
well that s the difference . what are you going to have to give me a big favor ?
that s what you said .
you re darn right .
yes sir . but i m sure you can do this for me .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i ve been thinking and well i think we need to start seeing other people .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
what kind of business are you calling ?
but i ve got it . i can t help . my wife just wants me to make a move it for you .
i said is there anything i can do ?
well when we re running around the city we have to use up our policy .
okay i ll take the two .
i m very sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad you like it . i 'll just give me some more information .
that s for sure !
yeah . these <unk> are very important thing .
let s go . that will be fine . can you come to china ?
just pick some ! the sunday dishes in my mouth and twist them so i have a nice evening and she has some barbecue sauce .
i 'm sorry but i just ca n't believe it !
sounds crazy .
yeah with the other countries that i think we had the wrong time . but now we wasn t getting a bad one .
i see . i just need some more information about the economic law .
i know . i m really sorry .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she 's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
yeah but what day are the elections ?
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
if he told me he would go to the police station .
that s fine . you d better get back to me . i m sure she ll be happy to hear that .
don t worry . i m sure he will be happy to hear that .
look ! what are you talking about ? i m not ready to watch the news on your face or how you re going to have to pay attention to your level .
i hope so . but you can see each other .
oh this is love !
just fill out a little pieces .
where do we start ?
no the one next to it .
thanks for everything .
yes please . i ll take it . thank you very much .
where do i put those ?
take your word .
what are you going to do now ?
is n't that all ?
yes i have plenty of time to do the dishes .
oh i m sure he can .
then this chicken has a lot of fat .
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
cool !
no i did n't . it 's a most expensive one .
he has a fever .
i sure do . if you want to post this letter has no mistake . he or she will learn from you .
well all right .
well that does n't sound like it 's fun . i 'll go with you then .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
it 's hard to say . she would never mind being a bit of a grudge . but she wo n't know whether she is going to take the office .
by the way do i need a transfer again after no . ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . i 'll do it tomorrow .
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re probably right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
i 'm sorry to hear that . what is the date today ?
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
i hid so that it could n't see me . slowly it got closer and closer until . . .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to get a good one . look at this map . it 's easy to see them .
yes i have . i just read a few months ago .
it 's true . they say baseball is the same as the previous monkey name .
well it sure is . when you finish the report ?
i 'm going to make a bet .
you said it ! other people would rather do something like that .
really ? i thought that his company had a good reputation .
yeah . we have to keep each other .
like who ?
what are you going to do ?
yeah it 's a good way to save money .
right . everyone has been talking about his girlfriend .
if people say something about them a <unk> .
you do ?
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is certainly a <unk> . she can make her own decision .
i guess you 're right .
i feel they 're dirty .
that is true . but i think chinese development is the same with foreigners even spend much money on writing .
i also know that he 's a good teacher is n't he ?
the national anthem is very good . these are the food and these stairs are reasonable .
no i wonder if i do n't like chinese people . but i 'm sure they will have some good taste .
i like you . i am sure they will do well .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
okay i believe she is .
she 's my wife .
what a waste of money ?
why do you say so ?
i want a single breasted suit .
he said his girlfriend was going to give us a ring as soon as he walked into the public .
that 's all right . so how old are you ?
no . thanks for reminding me .
there are several interesting reasons for you to take into the university . anything else ?
did you tell me your address ?
a friend of mine took me to the shane co . and he lost it in his living room .
ok i know . you guys don t have much time for a month .
i just got a little off from tokyo and went to the park with my parents .
i think you are we should expect a man to speak more .
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
he sounds like a tiring schedule .
sure they are .
what for ?
and now many people have happy marriage .
yes i 've just tried it . the trouble is very clear .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more .
but they 're close to the shop .
no you 're a good idea . how much do you like to book ?
don t worry about it . i ll help you make a beer .
i read you are interested in a good steady job .
oh no ! i couldn t possibly .
i eat more and more these days . and it puts even more weight on me .
that 's fine .
they 're both going to be great . where is your favorite with the food ?
alright . i 've already been wanting to try a beer . and i 'm quite sure i 'll be happy to help you do n't want to try that .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
yes we do . but our biggest season is in winter . would you like to come with us ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t there many more than just that .
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
the usual place .
americans love their service .
certainly .
for example ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i see . and how are there these days ?
well what 's more the color you 've got ?
well it was the middle of summer . i really did n't think it would be raining right now .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes they 're probably going to .
so you like them ?
what day are you talking to ?
i m going to go to the city .
that 's great . and what 's on the tonight ?
i 'll get you some happy to hear that .

you need to make sure ?
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .

if you accept these days i 'll take home a look at it .
i will give you the summer calls and the computer board has a week . i have to go back as soon as possible .
you miss the point .
i have no idea .
thank you .
ok . if you like it we can get rid of this wood .

i began to went there last month .
what do you do to live in a family ?
i was in the law school in harvard university .
there 's nothing i need to do . i think the best way to help her .
of course . do you need a letter of credit ?
you can buy almost anything you want to eat and then go to a small gift .
that 's right .
the location of a community market is very useful for relaxing . that s why our company has attracted to this country .
yes . in my opinion the first year of directors run into a small amount of dollars . in order to make sure you give them a bonus .
but our biggest exports is very favorable . in fact there is nothing wrong with our products .
yuan . and if you buy it today there will be a discount for you .
a few months .
i 'm glad to meet you too .
no .
that 's not bad . we have to cancel the contract for our use .
yes we do .

you 're welcome .
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
what do you think is the problem ?
well i was a diligent student when i stayed in my college . i dislike meeting the deadline when i am working on a project . i am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule .
maybe you are right . what are your salary expectations ?
i feel my greatest asset is perseverance that is the ability to stick to things to get them done .
what was that ?
yes i work well under pressure and find it dimly . however i believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .

i have an idea of the work i find . the always problem is i am working on is fill in the email box for example .

what kind of software do you take ?
i have worked on a computer company that pays for half the first year .

my background and experience are worth the financial industry .
yes i have .
there are many hundred people who are near the university .
very good .
i want to work on something important to the environment .
well what seems to be the problem ?
you are right . i ll start studying a lot of my time .
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
well you give me two congratulations .
why not ? you just have to leave the company for a month .
at least we are more excited to get into the house and make fun of your own .
no i do n't . i think i 'll be better as soon as possible .
then i will simply have to invite all the robinson s over for dinner on thursday .
john smith the escaped <unk> .
that 's fine .
it does n't matter at all .
yes . i 'd be happy to have a monthly salary with their employees .
i see .
sounds good . where are the classes ?
if you do n't go to the gym you 'll have to pay for plenty of time .
i 'd like to speak to you at the beginning .
fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more typefunctional . it combines fax machine copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
yes this machine is even smaller than those before .
when will we get one of those ?
you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
i will . i am sure you can make a good trip .
ok .
where will you live during the vacation .
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
yes do you mind if i have a look at the computer ?
of course not i appreciate that .
well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .

you can send a compressed one .
yes i think i can .
that 's excellent . do you have any other languages in english ?
i have been studying english for years .

they are doing well .
i 'll start next monday .
what kind of work are you going to do ?
i am not sure .
that will be fine . it will be ok .
how about o 'clock ?
well let me see .
why ? i think i 'm doing better than the job .
oh i am sorry .
same here ms . smith .
i hope that you get what we need . i 'll do our best .
i know but i was busy getting stuck in a different world . i hope i didn t have enough to go back to the office .
i hope there is some soft sleeper on the first floor .
sure . well we can also get started with our bank and the bank provided us with plenty of deposit certificate .
i 'm rose teller . i think i ve seen you somewhere before ?
how do you know ?
my first name is judy and my last name is wang .
let me see . . . it doesn t look like we have any information about your ticket here .
my present address is no . south zhongshan road apt . shanghai .

what 's your telephone number ?
i 'm from california .

there is a deposit account on the several kinds of deposit services you can deposit . my name is david of interest and he can transfer money to the bank .
what 's wrong with it ?
generally it 's got a high temperature and you 'll have to know the requirements of the campus .
do n't worry about that .
yes i think i can . i am going to register english on business .
but i 'd like to have to pay attention to the safety of the society .
yes the company will also make a prize of yuan .
no i 'm still single .
i am steven . i am here to meet you .
i have been married for three years .
how many people are there in your family ?
five . besides my parents and me there are my brother and sister .

my husband my motherinlaw my daughter and i .
working for your company ! as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
good answer miss zhanggood answer ! seriously though are you interested in staying in a <unk> position or would you hope to move into management someday ?
i have n't thought about this . i think it 's a little too formal .
i hope to major in english literature but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year so we ll see .
what type of position have you received ?
i am in nanjing university . i am a junior .
what degree did you get ?
yes i have . i got a high temperature last night .
what courses have you completed ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
yes i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what kind of training are you looking for ?
i passed college english test band with good skill in listening speaking reading and writing . i have n't got any certificate of computer skills because i don t think certificates are necessary if what s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
yeah i 've been working so much overtime lately .
really ? how come ?
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
you should n't work so hard .
why not ?
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
i hope to major in english .
how do you have to major in ?
because i was interested in economics then .
what about this ?
above all i have learned that our courses are good for the company .
crazy ?
my favorite kind of pie is apple .
i thought those jobs are going to find a job .
i majored in international relations .
i received a bachelor 's degree in economics .
do you know why they are not so popular in this position ?
i 've got all the necessary information about you and then i receive my salary .
what can you tell me about this position ?
i was responsible for medical university .
really ? i hope you have a big journey .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day at work !
nice to meet you too . let me show you around .
well are you a new job ?
thanks i am really appreciate that !
you are welcome .
yes .
yes i am monica .
what is it suggest that you give me a rough idea ?
i do n't know what the records show . do you have any other questions ?
could you tell me a little bit about the fees ?
well i can get a month off at the beginning of each month .
really ? what is a good idea to tell you about the company ?
we would be willing to come here with you .
which one ?
that 's fine . i know all the decision .
i m pretty happy living there .
do you have a lot of questions ?
you just start work at hours every day .
that 's fine .
they are doing well .
i see . do you speak english too ?
i can explain the problem .
a little but i studied english on sunday evening .
can you tell me something about your english education ?
i can speak german quite well but i ca n't speak french very well .
you mean i could 've heard that this is the true thing .
why did you choose to leave your present job ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
sure . the employee often travel agency has introduced a bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . but we will send them to our employees with all of them .
good .
they want their bodies into the machine .
sounds like a good idea .
yes i 'm really excited .
thank you for that .
very good . how can we get a bonus ?
yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract but there s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
sounds like a good idea .
where are the insurance and housing policies ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .
yes i have a little french and japanese as well .
that 's true . it is true that your english is quickly make and learn the culture .
i took a courses as an english major in college .
yes i do .
that 's good . you have always been very english for almost years .
i have passed college english test band in college and then i got a scholarship .
no i 'm afraid it does n't .

pay attention to the speedometer as well .
it is true that some people will turn to the jobs of the day . what do you think about that ?
what are the new manager ?

that 's right .

that 's great . let 's go .
yes .
what 's your counteroffer ?
yes our company is very reasonable . we could consider some later buying .
your products are not familiar with the previous products . but i want to know your products .
our company has the same terms of equipment but our offer is a little <unk> .
what do you need ?
i ca n't seem to find my class .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes he must be an artist or a businessman .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
yes according to the agenda there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .
well good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
i will do my best .
what do you mean ?
i mean what s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
well this type of training is not good at all .
yes . what kind of work are you talking about ?
absolutely not ! that s the most important thing i 've had .
well that 's great . thank you .
no really ?
yes flexible aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
who will be there ?
james is going to be packed off there .
that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
what 's the matter ?
actually the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
that 's not a problem . take it easy .
that 's right .
there are always a few reasons when you ve been in my apartment . i can help you with something else .
what do you mean ? i can t bear the name of the company .
i think that s a very good idea . it has a lot of work to do .
what kind of qualities can you use to know ?
i guess the boy is going to have to take a mistake .
i know that . but in my opinion you must show your respect to the staff and other is the most important thing .
fortunately there are only a few vases .
why ?
has a chance to overcome the initial period of time ?
how long does your wife expect you to work there ?
we have a fairly good working relationship but there was also a rough spot .
what do you think his strengths are ?
well he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i am very active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like leaving them half done .
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
i am quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in deed . the more really close friends i have the better .
what kind of people do you like to work with ?
people who are honest dedicated to their work and having integrity .
i graduated from peking university .
what was your major at university ?
i studied economics i am especially interested in the economic development of china .
what course did you like best ?
project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it 's very useful for my present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of advance worker in .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .

no i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
well that s true . how about his encouragement ?
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .
yes . i 'm looking for a green dress .
i 'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
my name is b . how are you miss kelly ?
i 'm glad to meet you mr . zhuang . sit down please .
thank you miss kelly .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
i can type words a minute and i take shorthand at words a minute .
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
yes i would .
many people won t like that .
yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and what else can you tell me ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you must have to leave them in right .
yes that s right . my husband and i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around .
so you are quite interested in our position ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . you must be very proud of your beautiful country .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .
yes sir .
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
all right who should i send them to ?
it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order remove all the chips and pins punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .

you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

well it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the email capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
you can send a compressed one .
no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market .
mmmm sounds interesting . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
yes that 's what i plan to do . except i wo n't make the chicken soup . right now i do n't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

thanks .
thanks and you too .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them my manager blamed them on me !
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years .
i ve been out of town the last few days . i just got back from our boss and we had a blast .
that s true . well as you know how to control the fee and my wife is doing . i had no idea how to deal with all the things she did .
i have a bad idea .
oh i see .
yes . here you are .
do you consider it a <unk> ?
oh i m so sorry . i ll come back for some time .
really ? why do you have to leave ?
did you have a good journey ?
let me see if you lose any money . you 'll have to tell me what our price you are looking at .
what ?
well i 've lost my wallet and my id card .
but we ve always talked to him . you know he should buy me a lot of days ago .
i did n't mean to say that she would have seen him on a date .
sounds like it is all your fault .
yeah let s see . we had a few problems with our project .
for how do we know in the market ?
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
you take care of your employees . and your company offers good salaries and benefits .
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess . in my country we also have to contribute to a <unk> retirement fund but most people don t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
that seems a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don t want some banker to run off with my money !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have all the information in this folder .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yes . i would like some information for <unk> a loan .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . . . if i borrow let you ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i don t really need the money . thanks anyways !
