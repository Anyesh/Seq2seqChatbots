a piece of apple pie ?
yes i 'd like some coffee .
how would you like your coffee ?
thank you very much .
ok i ll have to pay them as soon as i get my bill .
yes .
please do n't worry about it .
certainly sir . where are you going ?
ok .
it 's by my watch .
ok . could i see your driver 's license please ?
come on please .

i do n't know . i 'll try chinese food .

just send it to the sellers immediately .
i do n't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they do n't have to cut out fattening foods altogether though .
so you think it 's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods there 's nothing wrong with having a small desert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously there 's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
that 's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day but i do n't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement but they do n't do much good if you do n't have a wellbalanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
where are you going ?
please .
oh great . i 've got a lot of work . so you always get caught in a traffic jam .

ok . here 's your ticket and your driver 's license .

i think a cab is better .
thank you very much .
you 're welcome .

i like miniskirt .

it 's a pity . i think that it 's too small for me .
i really like this one .

how do you want it ?
can i get it from the musical ?
all right . i 'll show you something darker . do you like it ?

i agree . what do you have on your mind ?
i have a look at the latest fashion . they are very fashionable and formal shoes .
very good . you should find an outlet .
of course . the fitting room is this way please .

are you kidding ?
i 'll give you five more minutes then i 'm wondering what was going on ?
no i bought it a new one .
oh that 's right . why do n't you just change a new one ?
i only paid for it .

you 're welcome .
we re glad that you re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
that d be great but could i have a cup of tea first ?
sure i ll just go put the kettle on . why don t you have a seat on the sofa and i ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
i ll take a little milk but no sugar please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .

your parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .

yes it is .
do n't you think it s a bit bright ?
yeah maybe you re right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you but it s not very practical is it ?
no i do n't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it s casual yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top . it s too plain on its own .
how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet ?
that 's right .
that s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thingyou need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
no they re a prada <unk> for of the price of the real thing .

if i were you i d buy that now while it s on sale . if you spend more than you get a voucher for more clothes .
it s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !

what are you talking about ? let 's have a look at the menu .
you spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an emt trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
i think i 'll have a try .
i think they have some ice cream .

french dressing is not only as bad as it is .
i think that the secret would be a good idea for you .
do n't worry . i 'll change our shirt .
of course . how about the join us ?
please give me a piece of pie first .
hmm i could take it to the kitchen .
well they are poplar trees . they are widely used in our lives .

what s wrong ?
what do you want to do with it ?
you 're welcome .
it really was the best . did you cook it ?
i do n't like games there .
how about the <unk> ?
i have a lot of them . how about fifty million of them ?
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
yes but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
let 's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
no i haven t .
i ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven t lost it .
perhaps you left that at school .
no i had it when i left school this afternoon .
well . didn t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there .
yes i d better give her a call now .
but she can t be home now . she might have gone to the library .
perhaps i should call her later .
yes i m the manager here . what can i do for you madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?
. the toilet doesn t work properly the water doesn t run in the shower .
i m awfully sorry to hear that . i ll turn to it right away .
yes ?
um this steak i asked for to be medium rare .
medium rare that s right sir . i remember your order .
well i m afraid it isn t . it s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
if it is not to your satisfaction i ll certainly bring you another . but i m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
yes that s all right . thank you very much .
where did she say ?
is she easy to forget ?
oh yes . that 's very expensive .
that 's not necessary .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you 're at it ?
just remember that we are in accordance with many clients .
does it include a lot of advantages ?
perhaps you could give me the chance to be able to give up your job .
are you scared of anything ?
i 'm glad you 're out of that .
why ?
may i know what you do ?
so you wo n't need a car .
outlets usually give you great deals .
this is it you need to pay yuan for it .
but i ve never heard of it .
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
you 're supposed to be late so i have to go to work by then .
goodbye randy . take care .

i 'll get her to you right away .
why she was n't very tall ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's only about minutes walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
not at all .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong .
sounds great to me ! if they are willing we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun too .
good . let 's go now .
all right .
hi this is smith from can you help me with your project ?

i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday .
they spend hours there especially on weekends .
speaking of that trip alan bought a shirt at a department store but the sleeves are too long . do you know a <unk> or tailor who can shorten them ?

sure . i love going to the mall .
what do you do there . . . hang around like the kids ?
oh no i wo n't . but we will have an accident if you do n't stop shouting .

that 's the kind of thing .
hi dad . i was wondering if you 'd like to help me with my work .
i know it 's a tradition .

i am worrying about what i said just sleep last night .
have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
i think so .
you might want to try the mangoes .
can you describe a mango to me ?
it 's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . it has a big seed in it .
do i eat the seed ?
maybe some animals eat the seed but humans do n't . you 'd have to soak it for years .
what 's the price of these mangoes ?
today you get a percent discount . they 're only each .
tell me what they taste like .
their flesh is soft and juicy . it has a citrus taste . it 's sweet .
do i need to buy them ripe or will they ripen at home ?
just press into it gently with your thumb . if it feels soft it 's ready to eat .
where do mangoes come from ?
these are from guatemala but we 're going to start getting mangoes from india .
are you sure you are here ?
are you interested in today 's special ?
why do n't you call them and see what are your policy ?
how much would you like ?
yes .
right now we will send it to shanghai .
your flight takes off at

i 'm not busy tomorrow . could you come back tomorrow ?
of course if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank or open new accounts with you .
fine . we are very sorry for the inconvenience .
well i think you 'll like the mangoes .
i 've never had a mango .
it 's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they 're ripe ?
do n't cut into them until you can feel that they 're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
they come from tropical countries .
no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
not that long ago i think it was four months ago .
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
why ? i mean what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
first of all we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don t do this it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
i see . what else ?
we also check your spark plugs fuel filter and other oil levels such as <unk> fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
ok well i 'll put it that way .
trust me regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
it 's like a month .
can you describe a mango to me ?
well it 's a fruit with a big seed in it .
can you eat the seed ?

what does a mango taste like ?
they 're like a citrus fruit .
how do i know if it 's ripe ?

well we 've got some great mangoes on sale .

you mean i could buy it if that s expensive .
i have a lot of work for them . and the bedroom is one must .
where to ?
wangfujing please !
that 's ok .
i have to be there before o 'clock .
yes there 's been great talking with you .
that 's true . well i have to get my hair fixed .
i 'm very sorry . i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
two yuan please .
oh i see .
thank you .
no i do n't .
where are you going ?
please hop in .
do you have to pay it by yourself ?
i 'm completely lost . i 'm trying to find the way to my mother 's home .
please pay ten yuan for the registration .
ok . here 's ten dollars keep the change .
on a hill to the east of the <unk> river . you have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . you ca n't find a better home to live in .
what do you mean ?
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
ok no problem .
i see .
hi .
sure go ahead .
wow . that 's too much for me . do n't you have anything cheaper ?
yes i am . i just forgot to prepare my supper .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
no thanks . i need to get a call .
just a moment please . i 'll see you tomorrow .
yes we 've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it 's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i 'm sure it is wonderful but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i 'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it 's just at <unk> road . you can phone me again if you can n't find the right place .
ok . thank you .
yes . i 'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
a year but you ca n't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be ok to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we 're right in the middle of dinner .
mr green please .
sorry he 's out .
what time you suspect back them ?
sorry i am not sure can i take a message ?
no thanks . i 'll call back later .
that 's fine . please call again later .
ok thank you . goodbye .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first it 's comfortable and cozy . second it has a lovely view of the city . third it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need such as refrigerator electric stove heating apparatus washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important the electricity is free of charge . finally it 's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient
there is something in what you said but what is the rent ?
dollars per week .
in my opinion the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth the room is so large that i can share it with someone else and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good but i still ca n't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you you have to pay it all by yourself .
do n't you think i can save some bus fares since it s easy to go anywhere from here and it s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion you have to go to the university every day and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
that 's true . ok i will think about it .
where did he go ?
i 've asked him but he wo n't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop stop . . . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins you can go to work .
in that way i 'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that 's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
that 's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hi lee .
hi linda .
i 've been been playing it for three days .
fine then . how s your wife ?
i 've been studying for my exams . would you like to go with me ?
oh fine . you 've got a really good time !
i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
you are welcome .
what 's the problem ?
do n't you hit it off ?
i have been working at the doctor s department of production manager .
thank you .
he 's very nice .
what is she your strongest trait ?
this is going to cost me a fortune .
what a pity !
ok .
how many people are there in your party ?
ok i will .
i was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ?
sure we do ! we have the best <unk> in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
well i m looking to get a custommade suit .
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now let s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? my neck gets easily irritated .
no problem ! now for your pants let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
you might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . i tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .
ok . now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . please follow me .
please . i ll drive you here .
all right now what are you talking about ?
why not ? i thought we had a close conversation . you can t just leave me like this !
what 's more important to car ?
ok !
well i don t know what to do !
ok i ll be finished soon .
are you aware that he will remain remain remain remain remain remain remain remain remain angry ?
i 'll try to cancel an account .
what color are you looking for ?
no i don t know anything about my computer . we have a horrible taste .
you need to put all your clothes on the scales . we can t use it .
ok then i would also like to see the photos of digital cameras .
sure .
i 'd love the dog down the street .
i see . how about you these <unk> ?
yeah the air conditioning in water are process sheets .
i can buy an inexpensive camera .
okay . thank you .
why ? i guess it does n't have sense .
what 's next ?
thanks . now i have a pair of clothes i can take .
ok .
oh wait a minute .
really ? what 's the matter ?
you 're welcome bye .
i d like a half a pound of ground beef please .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean if you know what i mean .
could i also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of <unk> chicken breasts ?
no no no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs .
no that won t do . i ll take this smoked ham you have here .
okay is there anything else ?
is this salami and bologna you have here ?
yes ! it s very fine meat !
sounds good . okay that s it .
wait ! we have tbone rib eye and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house . . .
mmm . . . no that s okay really . i think that s all for today .
okay . that will be thirtyfour dollars and fifty cents .
i would like to buy some flowers please . something really nice .
i see may i ask what the occasion is ?
it s not really an occasion it s more like i m sorry .
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
well this is our i m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don t think that s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i m sorry sir but what exactly did you do ?
well i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store you jerk !
i m sorry sir . this computer is not broken or damaged . it s simply just too old ! that s why your programs and applications are running slow . there really isn t much i can do .
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
yes but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming <unk> faster and faster !
ok i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
well this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four <unk> processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course it includes a mouse keyboard and desk speakers .
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze ! if it does we ll give you your money back !
i know i know . ok so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle . also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
so complicated ! ok what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white tshirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
you know what ? i ll just have everything dry cleaned .
it 's a blackout . now i ca n't see seinfeld .
so what ? i just lost one hour 's worth of work .
really ? how could you do that ? do n't you save every couple minutes ?
no i did n't save this time . damn it ! and i 'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i 've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i 'm writing something i save every three sentences or so . i do n't want to lose anything .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they 're worth .
what are we going to do now ?
i 'll speak to bob he 'll be able to help us .
i wonder how much of the city is down .
it does n't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
maybe . but if there 's a blackout probably the pubs are closed . and besides i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do .
yes that 's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper and now i ca n't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read you can .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
i like your idea of getting a beer . i think i 'll go out myself .
maybe we can trade . why do n't you stay here and read for my exam and i 'll go drink beer ?
no it just wo n't work . if i read for your exam you wo n't know the answers tomorrow . i will .
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
how many students are in the class ?
about fourteen .
so it wo n't work old buddy . they 'll see that i 'm not you . sorry .
damn !
hi . i would like to get an internet plan for my house .
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
i have no idea what kbps means . i just want to be able to get online play games and chat with my friends . oh and watch movies online as well .
well this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
do you have to pay an installation fee ?
lucky for you this month we aren t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself bucks right there ! and we ll throw in this pen drive !
awesome !
thanks . i told you that we should call an ambulance .
whatever .
oh come on you can t give me your email address .
it 's really the same thing . it did n't seem like the house . well it 's almost as serious as the kitchen .
are you aware of the problems ?
you 're paying by check the price yourself .
sure . why don t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .
it s just the right sizea perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
i m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it s june now but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes it s half price . it s supposed to be too largethat s the fashion .
i might get one too but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
why do n't you try this one on ? it s quite fashionable .
i m getting this <unk> doesn t it look cool ? i d like to get some jeans too but i don t have enough cash on me .
don t worry . i ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
thanks ! now i don t need to come back to the shop a second time .
it 's not really all that good . the bedroom is a little small for us .
small but it should be enough for our needs . i think .
but there 's no hot water after at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . it feels good .
that 's true . but i love the living room it 's huge and filled with sunshine .
true and i like the kitchen .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
you 're right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we 'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
i know but the rent has been a lot of useful for some time .
i have n't thought of that .
thank you .
and can i do the charge for something ?
the rent is every month .
that s pretty cheap for out here .
what is good for you ?
what are you going to do ?
you do n't .
i will stay here if you like .
how long have you been going to stay at home ?
i just saw a piece of movie that i wanted to try out .
i am afraid not .
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ?
i don t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can t stand doing the washing up drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian indian and chinese . i ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference not the ingredients .
how long will it take to cook a meal for five people ?
obviously it depends on what i 'm cooking but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
certainly madam . what kind of dress do you like ?
what can i do for you ?
the blue one 's fine .
maybe you can find a little cheaper .
great . do you want to give me a ride home ?
that s ok . i ll take care of it .
of course . let s go . we need these new clothes .
i need them for my wife .
what would you like these shirts ?
i want a formal suit .
wow you must be the only one thousand yuan .
i think we did .
i am sorry . he is busy now .
i was wondering if the problem is available for me .
yes it 's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ?
i am interested in having a job would be more helpful if you could give me a few days of money .
i love it the apartment . and the daily rate is dollars each month .
good . i will see you then .
great . i 'll see you at . do you know where it is ?
i 'd like to buy some .
i d better go ahead .
can i bring anything with me ?
no . i only need to check your driver 's license .
certainly . as you can see we have several threepiece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite .
that 's great . the price has been reduced by .
i ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ?
it s quite large . it s about square meters .
i d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ll just browse through those ones over there .
yes it 's pretty cheap .
the view from what looks like .
i think you re right on the way to find a lost cause .
i think you are gonna take a look at something .
that 's not bad . i think we may be living on the top .
oh the kitchen looks nice .
how much is the rent ?
i like that suggestion . let 's make a decision .
oh come on . one little dogs and a few dog .
oh it is nice !
how about a minute ?
i think the government is going to move on to it .
yeah . how about that one ?
yes it 's a great finish .
i love the beautiful lawn . let s have a look at it !
what 's special about it ?
right .
you can use this kind of vegetable you can use it .
this is he . what can i do for you ?
hi i m calling to see if you are interested in the apartment manager .
oh do you need to see it ?
i would love to see it in the apartment .
i will give you a call later today to see you .
yes . what 's the problem ?
i have no idea .
sounds good . see you later .
where are you going to live ?
thanks .
we 're making dishes . all you need to bring is a camera with you .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus the book is in the library but i have n't been able to find it .
well you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i do n't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well first let 's consider your computer . here for example is a system i highly recommendthe power macintosh g . it comes with megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixtyfour ?
yes it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well so you will mostly be using word processing for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let 's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it as it

yes .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
yes . it 's an excellent system .
hmm . hey wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
but i ca n't understand why i 'm interested in that .
i 'm sorry but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
that 's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and <unk> and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you 're from ?
ah i 'm sorry .
well i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america especially in universities and publishing companies apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i 'm sorry .
no do n't be sorry . it 's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me most of the students here in the universityasian students <unk> of them use apple .
well thanks for your advice .
you 're very welcome . here is my card if you need any help .
how long would you like your haircut ready ?
yes my name is ms jane reeve reeve .
sure i do n't mind . what do you want to see ?
no i 'll take it easy .
how would you like it ?
ok .
how long have you been on this cut ?
i 'm sure it 's enough . is there anything else i can do ?
thank you . i 'm glad to have my own works .
yes . now lean on the heater only has been wanting to prevent your performance at rest .
i haven t seen you for several days .
yes . the main thing is to cut out the skin of my life .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
oh no it s just a little exercise . they are very tough .
it 's really a good thing to be true .
oh it s very kind of you .
you mean you 've never had a boyfriend ?
yes i 'll try my best .
yes . i have a car park in the parking lot .
how about this one ? it 's made of pure silk .
oh i see . i guess we do n't have any <unk> .
i like this very much .
i 'm not sure if you want to look for your bedroom set .
what 's wrong ?
let me check when we get out .
we could offer you the owners with a counteroffer .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
yes their idea is against the fact he is our financial .
i do n't know why but we hope the contract can meet again .
how about a month ?
alright . i hope he can help you find a job search .
i understand .
sure . where do you want to go ?
it 's not that bad . you can have a lot of advantages .
yes the owners could offer you housing system .
it 's not fair .
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
your boss must have stayed here long enough to go down the market .
it only sounds complicated . it 's really very easy . a lot of people here in america finish their own furniture . it s a good way to save some money . and a lot of people even enjoy it .
both the time and then maybe you can find a parttime job too .
absolutely . i ca n't wait to see my sister tomorrow .
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant so i have to practise cooking !
how about a dessert ?
i prefer sea food .
yes i 've heard about chinese food .
yes i am .
well i want to cancel it .
i like spring rolls and fried .
let 's think of something a little .
no i have n't . i know how to try something new .
yeah you can keep them too long . when can you eat something ?
that 's right .
do you like it ?
all right .
you have made several chinese dishes . let 's go to the chinese restaurant in taiwan .
what do you need ?
well could you help me with the l c ?
i think that we should use them right away . i think that we need a few more furniture .
ok . i think about that . where should we use their office ?
i will .
ok . do i have any questions ?
you 're welcome .
yes could you please tell me what 's going on ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
mike you ca n't tell me .
we have just started . and we 're looking forward to seeing you .
all right .
well they are cheap and puffy filled with beautiful arts .
are there any good local companies ?
yeah it 's a lot of fun .
is there any other companies in the department ?
yes . i know your friend 's in the gym .
what 's your favorite thing then ?
you missed a court appearance .
that 's true . it s a good idea .
that s my own company .
i want you to pick up something tomorrow .
you 'll have to pay every time you overdraft .
let 's go to another place . . .
well there is no problem .
yes i would like to exchange some money .
do you have any of those skirts in this case ?
here it is .
okay i think you should take it home .
i can t stand on the street because i like them . my laptop is on the corner .
and you 're going to hang them right ?
oh i see . do you have any other skirts i can take them here ?
what did you say to him ?
well what about this one ?
that s true . you re a really good idea .
what else is it ?
oh yes i 'm sure i do n't have any of those here .
what would you like me to help you ?
to be honest i 'm glad to help .
here you are .
thank you .
are you sure ?
so you 're the only one i can find is on the way .
sure go ahead .
i am disappointed with your work lately .
anything else ?
is that right ?
anything else ?
have you taken a walk ?
it 's true but the problem is that the place is finished .
you are right !
hey ! look at it ! there are those new computers all over the the the world !
now that i have the own sale ! what do you think of the purchase ?
how come ?
you know . i just do n't like eating too much .
what 's the matter ? did your father usually just returned home ?
yes i bought them yesterday .
i do n't like doing very much . do you have a favorite dishes ?
that 's really interesting ! you know it s almost eight months old news .
well i usually use a cook once a week if i do n't mind .
sounds good to me . i believe you re not ready to make dinner .
hey darling . i 've always had a stop feeling like bruce lee .
that s a good idea . you should make a deal .
well i 'll make sure to get up many dishes .
it seems we 'll have to make a difference .
not really . there 's a great variety of food and some people get away with food .
let 's have a look at that village .
most sichuan food .
well i 've got used to learn chinese food . i 'm from taiwan too .
i always order fried spring rolls when you 're making a date .
do n't worry . our machines have to be able to use the fax machine first . if you do n't feel like your system you can use an extension to one of our hands .
well that 's not good for me .
come on you are not out .
there is no need for my health .
i see . then i ll have a glass of wine .
i think i 'd better take some advice .
of course not . let me see if i could .
unfortunately i 'd rather have trouble with this .
orange juice . bring me one day or go with ice cream .
yeah you are right .
no they say that it 's kind of boring .
oh that 's a good idea . what kind of dutch means ?
are you sure ? these are the problems .
no i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i 'm absolutely useless at cooking !
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !
i know they are n't good for you but they are cheap convenient and fairly tasty .
i recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize .
yeah why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning so let 's start !
what do we do first ?
first you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot put a little oil in it add the vegetables and stirfry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about cm long and then it can be stirfried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i 'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
what 's available ?
i 'm not going to cook anything .
what do you want to do ?
well i know i 'm going to cook .
what do you feel like having ?
i was thinking of pizza .
how many ?
okay i 'll pick you up at .
i 'm not going to cook anything .
if you 're not hungry then cook something .
okay . i think i 'll go get a snack .
can i get you something to drink ?
why do n't you ask me ?
good luck !
white wine and a cup of coffee .
what kind of soda would you like ?
but i have no idea .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
i see . who should i drink ?
i feel like a cup of black tea .
just my best water please .
do you want me to pick you up an water ?
i have n't got the slightest clue .
well what do you want ?
apple pie is my favorite .
why do n't you like them ?
i like them very much .
come on . you do n't love them do you ?
come on . you do n't like them .
i 've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
come on . you can buy them for you .
yeah . and i do n't like them very much .
come on . you do n't like them because they are fresh .
are you ? i thought you had something to drink at her home .
sure . what do you want ?
where do they sell both at ?
i do n't know any basic plan .

did you see the time that everybody knows how to use it ?
yes .
sorry . it 's too early .
you mean that we are on the bus ?
mom you are right .
it means there must be no naked flames or <unk> anywhere near flammable materials . if the materials <unk> it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
maybe . it is really wonderful .
well maybe i 'm going to leave .
why do n't we go back to the next bus ?
not good . i lost my wallet .
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .

i do n't know i 'll let you know tomorrow .
o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room sir ?
yes most of the time .
you have your own vehicle ?

i do n't know .
yes i am a little more excited about this .

i 've got a run . can you tell me to take the temperature ?
what 's the matter ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
what ?
don t you remember our company yet we are going to talk about the women in the company .
you know he is a hard worker .
i think i want to try a new style .
come on !
i have told my english is up . you are the only english teacher .
me too . i hate working with you at home .
yes i am . how about you ?
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i will be back next week .
i like word games .
what 's your favorite course in english ?
actually it 's not that good . i can read but i ca n't speak very well . i have n't had a lot of chance to practice .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle but when i feel lazy i drive my car .
i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !
i agree but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it 's just so convenient .
cars might be convenient but they 're so bad for the environment .
do you have a car ?
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around i found that i did n't really need it .
maybe if i sold my car now i would n't be so tempted to use it .
you could try . it would save you a lot of money .
that 's true . every month i spend hundreds of dollars on gas insurance and repairs .
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving you will get lots of exercise too !
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
let 's go to a car dealership . i 'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
sounds good !
oh yes i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well i 'm sure you will .
thank you for everything .
what 's the matter
i have a high fever and a bad headache .
there are a real lots of dishes . why do n't you go to a cooking ring ?
could i have one more blanket ?
i am sorry for that . but i know you will like cooking dinner .
ok . i am glad to ask you some questions .
fine thank you . how are you ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
i 'm in college . i bet it is in central school .
i like to play golf play badminton or crack jokes .
have you found a furnished house too ?
you 're so thoughtful .
see you .
i 'll have my best .

do you like pcc ?
really ? i thought you were going to america .
i was just going to cut back home later .
what does he have now ?
yes i know it 's a cool job .
it seems that way is good enough . look at my mom 's birthday party and i want to get along with him .

that 's really a good idea .
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
did you guys go on a date already ?
yeah .
i 'm sure you did n't want to study again .
it 's so important to me .

you 're really a good deal .
very good . did you ever go on a date of was ?
i twenty pounds of ground beef .

i decided to leave a parttime job as a waitress in the future .
that 's good . you must go to bed next time .
no i 'm single .
what was your major ?
yes .
you must have been too busy recently .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
she must be independent .

i see . but do you have any other questions ?
my wife and i can t afford that much .
well first of all i 'm going to work on a bad mood . many people get tired and sleep for their free .
that 's a good idea .
i don t know but the registration fee is always open .
what do you mean ?
i had my first choice .

oh we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
on the contrary i think he 's very serious .
no not at all . his examples are really interesting .
so they 're easy to remember .
yeah how about your maths teacher ?
he 's an old antique very serious .
bad luck anne .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
she 's another antique .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's very strict with us .

i am worried .

i feel very nervous about it .
do n't worry about it . try to look on the bright sight of things .
i want to get a job in the banking industry .
i think you have life isn t the same enough .
have you applied to the bank before ?
what about we should also make an offer on the basis of jobs and then go to work on ms . wilson .

do you have a seat ?
i know . thanks for coming .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
it is . it s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world with brief descriptions of how they were build their purpose and so on .
there are the pymeids . it s easy to see how they got that name ! they don t have smooth sides though .
there are you believe that though quite a position they must measure your prices .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ve never been seen one that shape before .
yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they re not perfectly cylindrical .
this is the world s largest sports stadium . it s a massive oval .
what sports do they play there ?
it says here that it s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings .
is that building a perfect cube ?
according to the book it is . i ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air it looks like a square with a semicircle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
is says here that it s a war memorial . now there s a distinctive structurethe stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
i just bought a new atlas . i m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that s a vast country .
canada china and the usa are huge too .
what am most of the world ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe but compared to many countries in other continents it s not very large at all .
the coast of france is very varied . the coast of france is just made up of france but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
i would like to look at some watch .

sorry not . the train has been delayed .
what s the problem ?
you ve had a busy day .

i think you 're right . the most important thing is that we can offer you a new service .
that 's true . his wife is still a baby .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
how should i go about it ?
she is tall to study english . why did n't you try to give her another hand ?
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
really ? he must be very happy about it .
oh really ? why are you always interested in getting enough money ?
thanks .
he would have to buy a bicycle .

what a pity !
it does n't matter .
ho no !
it 's still early .
gosh it 's already . stay here if you like .
since we 're late let 's go to see a film .
ok . hurry up .
i 'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i do n't think you 'll have any trouble .
no i should n't think so . by the way is there a socket for my <unk> ?
i think so . here it is . it 's by the basin .
is it a twopin socket ?
yes it is .
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
it 's an excellent one . i like it very much .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i agree with you .
what 's her figure ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
what 's the color of her eyes ?
dark blue .
how old is she ?
she 's .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
do you really think so ? i do n't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i do n't feel like sitting at home .
i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
that 's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong .
sounds great . let 's go !
good . let 's go now .
but i still have some time to go .
it was me . i am so sorry .
what did you think you were doing ?
i had to move it so that i can get my bike through .
how dare you be so <unk> ? that 's wrong .
i am awfully sorry . i did n't think you would mind so much .
never do that again .
i promise .
i do n't want to .
well come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ll cook dinner ? will you ?
i will but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh no . you know i hate it .
oh how annoying !
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
is 's infuriating ! i have to be in rome by five .
what was the problem ?
i just stayed home last night .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
of course . what 's the problem ?
i am trying to find this book .
that 's all right .
my computer shows that i have a terrible toothache toothache you know how to use the internet .
really ?
yes i might need a little bit of a printer .
how would you like your steak ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
where are you going to buy it ?
please give me the receipt .
it 's my pleasure .
ok . thank you .
okay . i will bring it up in a minute .
sure . we have . what 's the rate today ?
actually you have n't had much .
we are all tea drinkers . please bring us four teas .
have you bought it from the store ?
yes i do .
how much is it ?
no don t bother .
certainly . is there anything else you can buy ?
what 's that ?
what about roses ?
yeas it is . sewen jes speaking . how can i help ?
actually i 'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir . what exactly is problem ?
well easily it does n't work . it does n't even start probably .
oh dear ! i 'll do whatever i can .
oh do n't worry about it .
there s no problem with my bank .
thanks .
oh i see it .
now you can drive me a different way .
i would like to apologize for the inconvenience .
by the way would you please look at the time ?
thanks for understanding .
tell me about it .
i don t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm it doesn t look good .
what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it s brand new !
well missy the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
ugh . . . how long is this going to take ?
i m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts take apart your electrical system fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
nothing serious just a little <unk> .
i m sorry . i have to work overtime .
are you really ?
yes . thank you very much .
i want to be beautiful . i know i should go .
you should n't eat too much fried foods .
you think ?
yeah . it s a lot better than mine .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
hang in there . it ll all come together one of these days .
that s correct .
that s a great idea ! you ve been really busy !
excuse me !
i see . my train is still in such a hurry .
ok !
you 're kind of tired .
so what are you gonna do ? just quit ?
that s exactly what i am going to do ! i ve decided to create my own company ! i m going to write up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well no it can t be that hard ! i mean all you have to do is explain your business how you are going to do things and that s it right ?
you couldn t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc .
well that seems easy enough .
wait there s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ? then comes the hard part a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration <unk> factors from gdp per <unk> to how many children on
are you ok ?
almost the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales cash flow and profits . after all people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
um okay . well i just want a trim . nothing too fancy .
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
okay . um . . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
don t you worry i ll take care of everything ! starts cutting oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
um . . . no .
okay but you are going to be my masterpiece !
eh so so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i m trying to watch the game but you re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it s the third quarter and you ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh your precious game . you watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn t . you didn t just insult the salsbury seals did you ? why don t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just !
nothing is just that you were gonna go .
the same to you !
cut what out i m not doing anything .
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it s driving me crazy .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i don t slurp my coffee . and plus how can you hear it when you re shouting into your phone all the time ?
you ve got to be kidding me ! you re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
look we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but it s probably not a good idea to keep it up i m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
fine . let 's call a <unk> . i 'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
yeah i ll try to do the same . so i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
me too i can t stop scratching . they are everywhere !
do you have any bug spray ?
no i forgot to buy some .
then we ll have to put up with it .
we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us they ll get drunk and fall asleep .
that s without a doubt the best idea you ve had ! let s do it !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i have to get a new license and it s about time .
you are pretending !
well i think you re right . it is not very practical at all .
whatever you 're right . i just think they re beating a child .
i think you ve got a brain surgery . honestly speaking you look charming .
you mean <unk> . i know what you mean .
stop acting like this would be silly !
really ? i have to admit it should be easier said than eating the others .
yes .
i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help .
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
i don t know what to wear ! ok give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ll wear these as well .
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach !
thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense . now what am i going to do with my hair ?
well you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything .
not everything just this film . even the title is ridiculous and it s so long those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life so much so that i m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening but you re always so negative .
i m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
you see that s what i m talking about i can t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
well he s more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories .
love stories ? more like onenightstands .
don t criticize mario or else i ll start on those fat drunk friends of yours they re no saints .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
you re unbearable you can walk home i m leaving .
where are you going ?
i m going to the hospital .
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly why do you need a manicure every week ?
well first of all i like to pamper myself and my nails look great . you should come with me !
why ? i don t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
they don t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles file my nails and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
yeah sounds like something i should definitely do .
have n't been sleeping well recently .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
well you can simply tell them you want to sleep or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
yeah but i find these sorts of things hard to say . now i have to think about it .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand when i wanted some quiet time and people kept talking and laughing aloud it was torturous . for me a room to myself even a small one is ideal . though i do n't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
yeah you need to take it easy . but also do you know what you have any plans for change ?
have n't you heard anything ?
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
no but i do n't know what a ripoff of best movie .
if you know that it 's a bad habit . i am really tired of going to make any sense .
i happy to hear that .
i think i 'm your lucky fellow .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
thanks for coming .
when are you off ?
i 'm catching the eleven o 'clock train .
why is that ?
goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
nothing much . what 's new with you ?
not too much . i 've been pretty busy .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
gotta go . call me tonight .
okay . check you later .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
what ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
very well thanks . nice to see you again . i have n't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
oh nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?

it 's been nice talking to you .
goodbye . see you again sometime .
i am not sure .
it 's as plain as the nose on your face .
you mean armistice day .
well you can bet this relationship s going to be a flash in the pan .
you must have been here before .
i think you are absolutely right . actually my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks .
i m afraid that s not my cup of tea . i just find skindiving attracting .
so have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ?
not so bad but kevin does have problems with his wife .
what ?
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
poor kevin we should do something for him .
yeah i agree with you . but you know it 's just one of those things .
you do ?
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
but i find japanese ones better .
rock 'n'roll i guess .
so you 're using a music do n't you ?
not really . that s pretty heavy metal .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
no i 'm ok . we 'll get some chicken .
yeah it s been ages ! so how have you been ?
couldn t be better . and you ?
just as usual you know .
we ate everything from dinner .
yes i 'm going to dinner tonight .
is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
i hope so .
you 're right .
oh i hope it stays warm .
jack i do n't know what to say to comfort you but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate your perfect match !
that sounds like fun .
i m happy to hear that .
how about a dinner tonight ? my treat .
no problem .
yes but it 's not your fault .
thanks honey . i appreciate it .
well what can i do for you ?
ok . honey i am going to have a great time .
what should i do ?
that 's my mom .
what 's the matter ?
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
what 's the problem ?
i know . very common practice is becoming more and more common .
congratulations on you !
how about you ?
we 're waiting for my guys .
i have had a low fever these days .
why do n't you make up your mind ?
i understand . but you should have made an appointment .
i didn t know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .
my mum .
what would you like for that ?
well how about this ?
sure .
how about some fish ?
thank you . i must see your id .
you 're welcome .
excuse me i am sure the traffic is n't too far .
yes .
i 'm afraid i ca n't .
yes it is park in the park .
the street is n't wet .
you re a baby .
anything else ?
yes i did .
thank you . i hope i can do more then .
she 's in the garden jane .
oh i want her .
yes she was in a meeting with her husband .
she had to go to the hospital .
where did you learn ?
it 's true . he is a hard worker .
i think it 's a great idea .
sure they are . as long as they are more fashionable they should do more exercise than chinese women .
the ones that tea are the cheapest .
i guess it 's the only thing i was thinking about .
i hope so . they 're actually showing their sports games i like sports games .
it s not that bad .
dad i have to do it .
not yet . i 've had a few coffees .
i m going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
i like spring very much .
that 's really reasonable . they are very strict too .
cool .
is it the same in red underwear ?
let 's just say that . i 'm going to celebrate my best .
what day do you like the colors ?
how much have you been watching it ?
well there 's nothing i can think of .
ok . i will .
the score was excellent .
well it is .
not only is it affordable but it comes with all the appliances .
thank you for all your help .
yes .
that 's pretty good . how much did they say ?
i 'm telling you the truth .
today is playing the game .
i am really sorry about that .
i think they are set up on some other terms .
it 's all nice and the bedroom is so friendly .
it 's the fourth guy .
mike . i had no idea you were in the mood to move .
yeah . i agree with you . but watch the show is really special .
oh through a lot of hard work of course .
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was n't it ?
surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english .
you mean you didn t know much english then ?
no i do n't .
that 's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
first i worked as a servant .
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
i 'd like to but i must run to a meeting .
well i just ca n't handle it anymore so i wo n't figure out his eq .

i 'm so happy . i do n't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
you are welcome .
what 's the problem ?

i have been working at the doctor s department of production manager .

he 's very nice .
what is she your strongest trait ?
this is going to cost me a fortune .
what a pity !

how many people are there in your party ?
ok i will .
actually i do n't know what to do .
i 'm a big fan of snoop dog .

that sounds great .
i love to play the piano .
can you hear of the world cup today ? it 's worth every time you see it .
sure . it 's like a good way to watch tv .
we broke up . it was the first time i had a problem with our hands and ended up in the end .
i think that he had a litter too much of it .
i was just kidding . she never gave me my girlfriend 's birthday last week .
yes i remember the monitor of my class . i spent time on the plane last month .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
she had to go to the hospital .
no wonder he has terrible things to do .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
really ?
this is just between ourselves of course . he was a dangerous woman and we did n't know how to use his phone .
really ? it is expensive !
really ? what kind of problem is it ?
i 'm not sure . how did you do that ?
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
gross !
i am sorry to say this sir but you should 've been more careful .
but i honestly think so .
well i quit and gained it back plus pounds .
men are always in a position .
how did he make such a change ?
do you have a point ?
well i 'm not sure . you know how to rap music is !
well i 'll listen to your music and let you know how to dance .
it 's right . as a matter of fact i have seen his works well .
it 's true . but i ca n't wait to see it .
that 's fine . if you like it i 'll pop down in the internet and draw some money .
i see . it 's going to be a great hobby .
to tell you the truth it was completely accidental .
what can i help you with ?
no . i don t even talk to her at all .
i saw the garden girl .
i did n't know you liked him .
yeah i remember that she has been married for years .
she had a fight with him .
that s a time .
she was a very successful team .
that 's great ! it is our pleasure .
welcome to china .
i 'll look at the problem .
you 're going to see it on the street !
that is very nice of you .
thanks . let s go and see if there is anything else i can do for you .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building .
no problem . see you !
see you !
sure . you must know the details .
how often is the holiday ?
that 's why you do n't use so many things .
thank you . i 'll take it .
oh yes . it 's got a general figure in the company .
good idea . i feel a little tired to tell you how much your hands are .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another dollars .
you bet it .
because if you did you probably got ripped off .
oh that 's wonderful . what 's the weather like ?
you spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an emt trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
yes i remember it really . i did n't like it at all .
it is on the first floor . i 'll take the one .
do you have any plans for the next train ?
the party starts at .
wonderful ! i am a shopping agent and i want to sit there .
what do you want me to do ?
by the way i 'll pick up my baggage here .
where did you learn to cook it ?
what 's the matter ?
thanks for calling me .
thank you . and you 're mr . jones i want to ask you to fill out this form .
i like it . i 'll take one .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
but a june is the day .
the ancient olympics is basically a big cities which is called the five major lots of animals in the year .
why is it so ?
really ? i 've also got a copy of your reunion documents .
have you ever heard about it ?
there s a children who is dealing with .
sounds like a good deal .
oh no problem .
it 's too bad . so what else can i do ?
we will take care of money .
oh that 's great . i want to go hiking with you .
the final costing including advert design and production comes to fortyfive thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for . . .
why ?
what about these things ?
channel .
what if i had enough money ?
that won t be too expensive .
are there any other advantages ?
it 's a wonderful job . how can i get there ?
anything else ?
if you use the computer you can use the computer to save money .
in the morning .
yes it 's completely furnished .
how about rose ? it 's the most suitable one for lovers .
that 's my pleasure .
do you know what time he is ?
we are already working on the grass . i am looking forward to seeing the garden .
well i see .
it 's per month .
can you leave a lot ?
i am sorry but we can t .
that 's very convenient . do you need to do something else to help you ?
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
that 's a good idea .
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
by the way where can we leave them ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
well that s a little rushed .
i am very impressed by your resume .
you have no idea how proud i am of myself .
it was a great game .
that 's a secret . how did you go ?
how much is it ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
i don t know .
yes i usually only use it to get a new online bank .
never ?
yes .
it is such a nice place .
perhaps you 'd better have a good rest .
no i 'd like a crab cocktail .
you 're right . i hope we can walk home .
actually you have n't have much .
no thanks . i 'm full .
that 's right . i 'm afraid the time is much more important than the time .
look at that village i do n't mean to mention one .
i am really sorry but i did n't mean to carry myself with them .
no i do n't really know how to use it .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
did you get hurt ?
yeah i made it .
really ? that s great !
i got it .
are you more confident in your job ?
i hope so .
i hope you are welcome .
really ?
i think you should save too much time .
no please feel free .
what do you do in order to improve your english ?
i 'm afraid not .
nice to meet you too mr . zhang .
i love to dance the fast music and you ?
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it 's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
i am very tired with flowers .
i am not keen on smoking as a woman .
yeah . those dance is really into the mood of waltz .
then i can introduce myself to her now .
are you ready to stay in the mountains with my friends ?
yes it is . the chinese traditional chinese culture .
that 's right .
they are n't very strict with very low profile .
that 's fine . i think they should use them too .
i think the market is in the end of this position .
they have no reasonable price in the world 's sport .
for the most part of the time .
absolutely . i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent but also have a lot in common .
when we say your prices are much too high we do n't mean the are higher only by or percent . if you are to place an order with you .
ok . there is a nice dance hall .
great . here 's a dance of the dance floor .
thank you for your compliments . while it has always been a music player .
then you must be interested in disco .
yes it 's my favorite .
are you a football player ?
to a disco ?
oh great . then let 's go to a disco .
no thank you .
ok . let 's get something to drink .
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer .
thanks you . shall we stand a bit further ? i would like to take the tower in .
thank you for your compliment .
well most of the time i guess .
oh well . thank you very much .
i didn t get accepted .
yeah . every success of over three months i am afraid it 's supposed to be helpful .
yes you have to .
that 's great .
that 's a good idea .
sounds like a good idea to help me .
oh the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
it 's very nice . i like it very much .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
my pleasure . but i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a dancer and i suppose you dance often .
me ? oh no . in fact i only took up dancing quite recently .
oh really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
i 'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner .
thank you for your compliments . it 's just that you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one 's hidden feelings and is a healthy exercise . but i do n't do the rock and roll nor breakdancing .
oh yeah . let 's dance to the disco .
my pleasure .
ok .
swimming . what about you ?
do you like swimming ?
yes . but there are student passes .
put it there ! in senior high school i 'll take care of it .
absolutely . let 's go and play volleyball .
can i speed up my favorite ?
yes . it 's really nice and warm .
what do you mean ?
that s a good idea
good luck !
it 's mild but it 's not always pleasant . the weather 's often cold in the north and windy in the east . it 's often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
what 's the weather like in this ?
i like spring .
okay now if you could come back in about three weeks i 'll take it .
i really hope the picnic day is hot .
i like autumn too . why do n't you go with me tonight ?
yes it is . i think it 's the best season for you .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like hot as long as it gets cold .
well it 's supposed to be quite warm and then in the afternoon .
oh yes . i like the color of canada too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i wonder what it 's going to be like tomorrow .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i love it !
that 's what i think .
i think that it 's all set .
no i think that 's the biggest change .
no . i am from south america .
where were you born ?
i 'm glad you like it .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
not at all .
what 's the problem ?
it was a pleasure .
here 's the money .
sure what is it ?
what is the tariff ?
by the way .
would you like something to drink ?
i 'll pick you up then .
yes . why ?
where is the picnic ?
i 'd love to .
beijing international airport . would you please help me with that ?
is that a good idea ?
this afternoon .
ok i 'll bring it .
you 're welcome .
yes do you like it ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ?
it looks good on the outside but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
what 's wrong with it ?
there is a charge on my card that i did n't make .
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
they do . once my son was born there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it 's only a twoseater you know !
what else is wrong with it ?
the heating controls do n't work anymore so it always feels like it 's about degrees in the car even in the summer !
anything else ?
that s everything .
why do n't you get it all fixed ?
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
well let me know when you can get it fixed . i d love to go for a ride in it !
i had to look after my son at home .
what 's wrong with him ?
he has a bad cold .
is he getting better now ?
i think so . thank you .
it 's nothing .
forget it . if you are welcome to help yourself .
right i 'd love to . thanks again for the invitation .
i 've been feeling pretty well .
you have asked for it .
yes he is very intelligent .
i am glad to hear that .
i do n't know .
i understand . you were really tough .
i can t bear it right now .
it sounds great . i 'm afraid i can t .
ok . how about tax ?
this friday evening ?
sure i 'm ready to make it .
it 's very much like his house .
that s the flower girl and looks like a tower of chocolate .
i 'll bet they are .
no . i am still a few brother now .
hi ! i m going to take a second look !
no problem .
what s wrong with you ?
you 're welcome .
well i think we should go now . it 's getting pretty late .
you are welcome .
no way . please do n't worry about it .
i m just having trouble with her boyfriend .
yeah . but she is always making me disappointed .
is she easy to stop worrying about what she is going to do ?
you mean you can use your computer and i think they ll be difficult to get into the internet .
i 'd love to see that .
oh dear . it 's an important meeting to tell you that the truth is on the way to go .
but you said you are right .
that 's good . you need to stop listening to the police .
in that case i was really surprised by you .
yes i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
it 's true that we have been here for years .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years but cars are still a major source of them .
and have you taken anything for it ?
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don t believe that any single country can do anything about it .
i think you 're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
yes i did . i especially liked it very much .
well .
how about this one ?
it is true but it 's not that simple .
mmm it 's quite an expert .
definitely . it 's on the street .
what do you mean ? they are just fashion .
it 's making way back .
really ? so they thought it was quite different .
no that 's right .
those are the ones . i 'll take them .
the wash here will take some laundry .
do n't worry . i will bring enough sleep immediately .
you have got it .
that is a good idea .
what 's the same idea ?
take care of yourself .
yes you are right .
and have you taken anything for it ?
i 've tried to give up smoking several times but it 's no use .
you should have a try .
yes sir . it has been a most popular piece of fish .
yeah . i 've seen them in the original state . they are holding all the fastest swimmers in the world .
they are all in order .
yeah ! i think she was a boy now .
that 's the tradition .
yeah ! they could n't go out at all !
basically they were all sitting .
oh i see . so he was killed !
i know .
that 's great . what are you doing ?
i think you 're making a quick turn on the tv .
the time period is set on the street .
does it always close at day ?
then my son drove into a tree
maybe i 'll look in the sun as soon as i am staying in a hurry .
i 'm tired . i was hoping you would n't pick a airport .
what a good idea !
she lives in the suburbs .
i heard there 's no children .
about ten years .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
mm . i 've been working on it for two months .
i was not sleep last night . i really couldn t sleep well .
did you get any ask you ?
yes i do .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i have two children and a girl .

four .
who 's that ?
that s right .
what does she do ?
i got an overall score .
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
she 's still in the hospital .
oh she 's nothing to worry .
do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
you 're right .
then i thought you had a fight with jack .
thank you .
he looks strong . what does he do ?
he 's a captain .
he must be very brave .
exactly !
that 's my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
he must be very easygoing .
sure he 's ready to be friendly with anyone .
he was years old then .
how old is he now ?
he 's over sixty .
oh you may call him uncle or henry .
what 's he doing ?
he 's fixing his roof .
he 's a hero in our town .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
yes indeed people say he 's the smartest young man .
what 's wrong with you ?
and how about night ?
oh is n't there a foul ?
well i will be surprised if you had a lot of fun .
i 'll make sure she gets the message . would be back if you stay home .
it does n't matter .
what do you think ?
well it is still a chance to have such a job .
and the whole afternoon ?
sure i ll let you know when i can go to the party .
yes i was in london .
oh really ? is she old ?
the price here are so cheap .
i feel he is a real salvedriver is n't he ?
you mean the day after tomorrow ?
sure . i m great here .
oh please julia . i am thinking about him .
ok . i ll see you later .
i wonder why he could have such a good ear for this position .
how can you be sure ?
yes . he must be mad at that time .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
why do n't we go there then ?
actually i would have to go with my own company .
well i heard that she is not my real friend 's birthday .
i 'd like to very much .
all right then . there is one at the new concert hall .
who 's playing ?
it 's the powell orchestra .
do you know what they are playing ?
they 're doing a seventeenthcentury program .
and who is directing ?
well i 'm not sure of his name but i know it 's going to be his farewell performance .
sure . it s like a great school .
where shall we go to then ?
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
i 'm going to have to take a walk .
what 's that ?
oh he 's a very serious person .
you must feel very uneasy at his home .
there is nothing good at the moment . let s do something different . would you like to go to a concert ?
yes i 'd love to . here is a good one mozart and beethoven . it s on the festival hall . shall we go there ?
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
no i 'm not hungry .
well let 's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it 's a little expensive but it 's fun .
oh what does he look like ? is he tall ?
he 's tall and strong .
i can tell it from your build .
sorry about that .
you re absolutely right .
it does n't matter .
em it s delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
you 're lucky .
i 'm going to the movies with a friend . how about you ?
i m just looking at this map of the world .
that 's great !
hey do n't forget to buy a suit for me .

i was hoping to get out on as soon as possible .
i am afraid you could be right on the contract .
what did you know ?
i 'm not sure if you still want to .
yes she 's been thinking about that . why ?
of course . if you had to order a few postcards you can use that to send a postcard to herself whenever i 'm interested .
i 'm so happy that you found what i thought of .
yes it is .
that 's a good idea . but our boss is really busy and i have to go get her something .
i hope so . it 's been a long time .

thank you .
i think i might go out for a while .
it 's very hot the temperature is often over c .
do you like the weather in seattle ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i do n't like it in winter .
why ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
what about the weather in boston ?
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i do n't like winter .
is it very cold in winter ?
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .

how about winter ?
that 's a hard time . the air is cold and damp and the road is often icy .
it 's boring right ?
sure .
how long does it take ?
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
that 's right .
yeah and most excitingly i met the girl living under me today . she 's really nice .
i love it when the weather is like this . why do n't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
that 's a good idea . the sky is clear the sun is shining and there 's a nice cool breeze so it is not too hot .
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit this sure is a nice spring day .
hey this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
okay . hey is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . it s been a while since i 've not really gotten some sun .
i ca n't wait to turn on the lights .
really ? are you sure about that ?
but they must have other cars .
well .
she said she would n't be able to make it .
tom that lucky guy .
he is in the hospital with a bad cold .
oh my god . he is such a chain smoker .
she s sick .
but she s very convenient .
i need a few minutes doctor .
oh that 's great ! he has a crush on her own .
oh really ?
very good . he has a hard seat for us .
on the th ?
are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ?
well let s see . you have a lot of films then .
yeah . she is so clever .
yeah . she is pretty .
you do n't have to worry about her for yourself .
i would n't do it if i were you .
it 's sounds like fun .
it 's very dangerous you know .
i want to try something exciting .
it 's an easy way to get hurt let me tell you .
i 'll tell you all about it next monday .
well take care of yourself and do n't say i did n't warn you .
i thought i should have been missing them .
my hair was supposed to be delivered today .
indeed it was a promotion .
that s because of my hurt .
a really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
is that true ?
i guess so . now anna 's got four kids and another on the way .
thanks .
because it was her husband who beat her .
it is incredible .
she said that she didn t want to foul her own nest .
he must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
galileo is one of them .
so are copernicus and many others .
i went bankrupt and i 'm flat broke now .
if i can do anything for you do n't hesitate to let me know .
thank you .
yes he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that 's a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
i am swapped with work after day holiday .
where did you spend your holiday ?
i went to paris .
he told me that i showed up late one more time .
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what s the matter .
nothing thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
what happened ?
john is a peacemaker . he simply doesn t bother . he says he should give him a free hand .
the cat has eaten my fish i 'll kill it .
but supposing your son killed like the fish what do you think then ?
i 'll beat him .
so beat the cat but do n't kill it .
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
it s too good to be true ! if i were there i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question you know .
they 're quite ill of him .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
you can count on it .
i think so . yes they get along so well .
i like him . he s good for her .
of course ! i think he 's a really nice guy .
no there 's no need to do that .
how did you make it ?
thank you .
i 'll be happy to look at it .
he had a finger in the pie .
you are kidding . that will put up smoking in the overhead bin .
ok . i want to go into the us .
me too . i m sorry to hear that . see you after class ?
well now there is the line . have you ever tried it ?
i washed my clothes for less time .
ok you guys don t have much luck .
i did n't realize it was a choice .
i think you are right . but we need to learn more quickly than others .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
he is going to be a little worried about the bedroom .
sure they re .
you have told him that he should be more independent .
and i know that you have spent a lot of time together . people in different departments get married too .
sorry i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well i 'm telling you now .
yes but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry i did n't think it mattered .
oh you men ! you 're all the same .
just tell him off .
well last time he gave you a award .
well it 's not the right time .
it 's nothing about it . but i am not sure they can accept it .
maybe it was dick .
i do n't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
then what do you think so ?
i have a love dog .
what about a delicious piece of chocolate cake ?
no i like the way too .
well you could always make up the mind by doing it .
thanks i like you .
i 'm glad you like her .
that s right .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !

it s a pity that i can t help .
i was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market .

what do you think i should do about it ?
she s got a gorgeous job .
so many children are learning by their work as a team .
well we ve got to work overtime . you can t have any trouble with them .
turn the lights off . then run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
you did ? that is great !
yeah i am having a party this saturday night a sort of house warming and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
no i am free i will be there what time the thing starting ?
around seven .

do n't worry i will come to pick you up at about thirty .
okay .
what happened ?
you must be joking .
oh i see . how old is she ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
i am sorry the answer .

i think that we re trying to maintain the same opinion .
what 's so beautiful ? your country are some people the only small amounts of fruit and vegetables ?
he is a lawyer .
you must have his own name .
what ?
sure . they re older and don t eat football .
thanks . we re not going to be able to put them in .
oh dear .
i know he will .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .

i feel they 're dirty .
i ve got some cold weather .
thank you anyway .
yes we are .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
oh lovely . where 's the wedding going to be ?
well . . we 're not sure yet probably in st . albans .
oh yes your parents live there do n't they ?
yes that 's right .
i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash .
we 're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in south london .
are you going to give up your job ?
yes probably but i may look for another one when we 're settled in .
hi sterling !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
professor wood ? i think he 's a brilliant scientist .
you 're got a point there . but do you think he 's a little absentminded ?
i guess so .
yes i did . how about a cup of coffee ?
the train station is on the did n't it ?
yes it is .
well we try to make it today .
fine ! how are you ?
i 'm fine too thank you .
i 've come to tell you i 'm going to the concert this evening . will you come with me ? i 've two complimentary tickets .
with the greatest pleasure . where is the concert this evening ?
it will be held at the music hall .
what 's on the program ?
it 's a piano recital . i 'm fond of piano you know .
no i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
yes . may i help you ?
may i introduce myself ?
yes .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
nice to meet you john .
it s a pleasure to meet you miss green .
well jim . it is a combination of how much you eat the type of food you eat and when you eat your meals .
i never eat breakfast though .
that 's a big mistake you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel and yet you expect your body to work without food .
i never thought about it that way .
i bet you eat a large evening meal then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy your body stores it as fat .
oh doctor i feel so foolish .
way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .
i know doctor thank you so much .
perfect ! could n't be better .
whatever . just make sure you pay the price .
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i 'm glad you 're so happy .
it 's super .
how about the cinema ?
that 's a good idea . we have n't been there for ages .
what would you suggest to see ?
oh i do n't know . it depends .
well let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well to tell the truth i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well in that case we could go to the movies .
oh we always go to the movies . can t we do something different ?
well do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me but we do n't have any beer and things .
well shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
i 'll get the flour out .
i 'm not sure . let me have a look . . . it could be a coffee grinder .
a coffee grinder ?
yes it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
oh that would be very useful .
oh nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything with everybody with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this you know .
what do you mean ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
you need a holiday . that s what 's the matter .
certainly perhaps .
ok . i think you 'll be happy .
well i could n't sleep well .
good idea . what s on ?
it was all very kind of you .
it was a while .
sure he 's on the other line .
i 'd like to discuss the new order with you . would you like to have lunch together at garden hotel next tuesday ?
yes mr . emory . what s your name ?
fine thanks . how are you ?
i m afraid i ll put you down . i ve already got a lunch on what time .
how about at ?
good evening david . good evening mary .
good evening david . good evening mary . it s so good of you both to come .
no . i have n't .
then let s go to the hospital .
i am very happy to meet you .
oh thank you .
my name is wang liang i m from beijing . where do you come from ?
hi mary how are you doing ?
i 'm fine thanks . and you ?
fine today though a bit under the weather last week .
thank you . i m glad to hear that .
thank you .
yes there 's plenty of room on the inside .
you can t be serious . it is for me .
i think i have got a run . can you tell me how to do it ?
i m so sorry i ve got to go .
of course ! i am sure we will have a good insurance policy .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
yeah . why not ?
yes .
it seems that people in order to get a chance of promotion .
it does n't matter . i think we have much better than that . we can go to see a doctor as well .
i see . and what is the maximum amount i can pay by attention to the safety ?
i also believe that .
i want some info about that . but i want a different one too .
you can also list your name on this company during the meeting .
well i ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
that 's really cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i m planning on living with my parents . won t you ?
i 'd love to but i do n't know if i can afford my parents .
you ca n't have a good time . do you have a one ?
not really they just don t want me living at home . my older sister did that and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home it got harder and harder for her to move out .
well it 's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life .
how can my parents live on my own ? i mean they want me to be more independent .
well the best way i have to live at home .
i 'm not sure . my wife and me there are a lot of telephone people .
and now ?
we did n't have any child 's parents . my brother lives in washington d . c .
that s very kind of you .
what a shame ! your husband is a housewife .
oh ok i see .
the best .
really ? i did n't think i can ask you one .
yeah .
how long does it go on ?
but you 're a hard nut to go ?
what happened ?
yeah . he s the money .
what s the problem ?
he is a tough husband .
really ? i ve heard about it . by the way who s the chinese teacher ?
i m not sure . besides the chinese new year and i m just not sure what s up with it .
thank you .
no . we have two older sisters now .
that 's really good . i think i could go to sons now .
tell me how could have such a mother s home ?
i was hoping you would come but i can t understand .
she is a nurse .
i guess you re right .
how long have you waited for it ? i feel terrible . when i only feel well at home i did it .
yes i had to stay at my office for two days . is there anything else i can do to help you with ?
you are right . but we just got lost with each other .
i ve been out of town .
really ? are you still interested in photography ?
i ve been back from paris .
really ? when did you have a look at it ?
yes . i love the third floor .
no i did n't . but i still love it .
yes that 's right .
i like playing basketball .
i just like watching them and go play .
you 'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
yes i like it very much .
what kind of sports do you usually play ?
i used to have a couple of different swimming . i will take some exercise to use them .
that 's a good idea . you should exercise more than a exercise .
i know . sorry . it s just pm .
what do you mean ?
well go home and pick up some fresh fruit .
catch the and get off at sons .
so you re just gonna play a couple of guitar picks up .
do n't worry .
i have a complete stick with my research .
oh that s great .
no i was out .
do n't you know how to play table ?
oh no .
yep ! you were born on shanghai !
you know what is the weather like in your country ?
what do you mean by that ?
it 's an american game on the world cup .
well let 's just sit down . do n't worry . you can use a computer to play on the computer .
most of them are .
hey ! that 's not a good sport . and you know what ?
wow ! that 's really a good thing to do .
getting a little bit of it . you know i 'm always thinking about this .
i was at work too . it s for me to be a fault .
i 'm not too disappointed .
yeah i know .
sure i could be glad to help you eat your body . that s why i never exercise .
are you looking for a space on this campus ?
that s a good idea . the coffee is very important to me .
oh so we should be more careful next time .
absolutely not . but we should learn more about it .
i guess it s easy to keep fit and exercise more . it s not easy to run .
that 's a good idea . thanks for your help .
why do n't you ask the people for it ?
i must have slept right through it .
so how long has he here for ?
i do n't know . who are you trying to say ?
i want to take a break .
i also know a lot of people have to work together .
i hope so .
i love you . and i think you re awesome .
what 's wrong ?
well the place is coming back to place the music then you 'll do that .
you said it .
it 's not the right time . she is a <unk> man .
how sweet !
not bad . how about you john ?
yes . but i 've just finished eating men .
you 're kidding !
everything 's fine .
i don t know .
please think it over .
oh i see .
next time you can get one from the counter over there . or before you come in you can download one from our website . it 's really easy .
it s saturday a great weekend .
ur you really let me down .
don t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
no you haven t . you just don t care about me . you re an indifferent husband .
what day is it on earth ?
it s an anniversary of our weeding .
he has no sense .
if i were him i would <unk> it outby asking my parents for money .
it 's true .
i 'm looking for it but you see the market is hard up for jobs too .
you liar i saw you again in the inn . i bet you do n't want to work at all .
yes he had better make a change .
how may i help him ?
is that true ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
how do you know that ?
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh and she left this morning bag and baggage .
oh i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
that 's a good idea .
how can i know if i had it ?
i 'll be happy to hear that .
after the breakfast which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
here you are .
i heard that he had a fight in the first time .
of course not .
you said she have to be in love with her .
you must have bought her some time to make up with her .
but she s not a chicken player .
did you know that she is a music player ?
that 's right .
yes . you have to buy her something .
well i 've got a reading on the internet . i know how to use this one .
what s this ?
i 'm falling in love .
fantastic !
they 're just gone .
you know he is a hard worker .
yes . he said he was very tall and slim .
it has all been quite interesting .
well . he said he was a very good cook .
oh yeah .
yes . this way i 've never been using the computer but i can never change it .
wow it s not the only time to learn .
the same thing .
i am sorry honey .
we are getting a little exercise .
life is committed to the must have created by a big fight .
it starts at
wonderful you 're right .
you know how to use them on the computer ?
the job is in the company . they are all new services .
do you know what the proper exercises is ?
that 's true .
oh yeah . that 's terrible .
no problem . in fact there are many places to choose . what 's a general manager of the company ?
i see . i 'll put them on my bedroom .
no you are already here .
how come ?
thanks . these new shirts is really been looking forward to seeing you .
i am sorry but i 'll be able to .
yeah i did the same feeling .
do you want to study english ?
i 've always had good luck at outlets .
oh 's clive !
but he is the best teacher .
yes .
it 's really a big problem .
he sure is .
that 's nice of you . it 's really important to tell her .
yes .
do you have the tv in the afternoon ?
you are welcome . bye !
hi andy . i 'm judy . it 's nice meeting you .
nice to meet you too .
where are you from ?
good afternoon mrs smith .
hope you will stay here for guys .
would you like to make a withdrawal ?
i 'll look for a nice little suitcase .
well . maybe you should probably buy a new one yourself .
the point is that some people use on the internet sites .
yes . there 's one of the art hall . let 's go and see a there .
that 's nice . thank you .
but there 's one thing she 's not good at .
please let me check my schedule .
oh smell different . only that 's why she loves them .
oh yeah .
yeah the guest . hey i think they 're ready to order a lot of good things .
i 'd like to smoke a lot of books on this spot .
i would have to pay a lot of water on this drug !
so what 's the series about ?
it 's just a moment and i can learn with it .
he is a little sad but he does n't n't mind being a child .
<unk> is good for you .
he 's out of john's hands . nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
if i were him i would give him a good <unk> . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i 'm john . is this your first time to take a longdistance trip on plane ?
thanks goodbye .
oh i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see i take this longhour plane frequently but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
oh that 's too bad . do you get a good knowledge of china ?
yes whenever i think about china i 'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i 've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
all of the chinese are proud of the great wall . and it was built before the in dynasty near shan haiguanthe first pass in the world .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
no before the in dynasty .
oh yeah . thought i am an american i know quite a lot about china and i like chinese tea very well .
both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times only summer events were included . when it grew popular there came the winter olympic games which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh i did n't expect you to know them . but yes i love them not only because of many medals they 've won but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
it 's a portable tv . it 's a popular thing now .
oh that 's new to me . so what 's on everyday ?
news about current affairs documentaries music movies noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes yuan per month .
what a lucky dog !
do n't worry . his father will be a bit too happy .
he 's a hero in the world .
then you 'll have to drink more .
and for the most active drink .
okay .
it is wonderful . what 's john going to do this summer ?
we celebrate it to make sure that there is a big house of sing and then tv in the afternoon .
the bridge is close to the door .
yes i know what play is like .
well children are not as played as long as they can .
oh what a freeloader . you could use them to play ball !
there are many rugby fans in my country .
that 's right .
less than you are afraid of the battle .
and his ball has stopped up .
there are many methods .
i can t play it well . i just want to have a look at what do you think ?
i hope you 've been able to make something more necessary .
perhaps you should get it fixed now .
get in . i 'll give you a call .
are you an expert on a it ?
yeah .
i know we need to get more sleep .
i was just thinking about something that i 'm just going to get ready after we have n't .
well good for you ! do you want me to have it now ?
no nothing .
come on !
yeah . she had a baby and she got a baby .
i think that there are any public places of interest in the country .
well the problem is that the buses must have been stressful .
yes i think you re right . we will get more thinking of something to a car .
i agree but i would prefer to use the train . it 's just too expensive .
by melting it down and then reforming it . our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .
well . we would have to turn the train system to develop their food . we don t need to use any train to educate kids properly .
well you know i should learn how to save more money .
people in show biz can be used with their parents .
yeah . people in the city are near the city centre .
no i did n't .
oh then you must have been sitting there .
i don t know .
i got it .
what did he say ?
what ?
yes but the whole thing is that he needs to take advantage of it .
what s the problem ?
not rally . years ago it was just a small insignificant village .
how did it grow into such a large place ?
large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .
as the city grew it must have absorbed many village nearby .
yes it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
i see . are there any building more than years old in your city ?
oh yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village so our city has a castle too .
really ? have you been on your city ?
it s hard to say . but i usually do .
really ? i 'm could n't play football with you .
i m not very familiar with it .
that s all right .
yes . as a matter of fact i have n't had a problem with my hands .
that 's unavoidable but think how would you keep up to date without television ?
it s a play at the same time .
i think tv is a popular hobby with beer .
well yes . i can play it well .
what s that ?
that was the last game before the playoffs .
not too well ! i m just to the doctor . i haven t been feeling too well . . over the last few days .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
that s the funny thing . i don t what s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
perhaps you ve been working too hard . you do have a <unk> job .
maybe . i haven t been able to keep my food down either . that s unusual .
well . i m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
yes he is . i ve make an appointment for o clock so i d better move along .
ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i m sure the doctor will prescribe rest you know .
yes i d love to . it s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear <unk> colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony but this year there are several contenders .
you are right . this year should be much more exciting than usual .
you might think this strange but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
yes i ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he s my idol .
how come you don t have all of his films on dvd ?
some of his early films are hard to find nowadays especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
i see . i m sure you ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
are you a member of his fan club ?
i was but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet so i m not a member now .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
of course ! i bought two copies .
two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of right ?
i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .
i bet they love it really . sure they complain about it but that just gets them more publicity doesn t it ?
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves so that they get invited to make more films go to lots of cocktail parties and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don t even pay for drin
show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that s why they need so much money .
i think it s because of their films and that they don t have any more .
i think you should give them some credit . they re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
you only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
thanks .
you 're welcome .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
just yesterday . i 'm still getting used to it .
well it looks very nice .
thanks .
let s see . what time is it ?
about o 'clock .
shall we bring any thing ? some wine ?
no not really . just bring yourselves . we would like to your presence .
really ? there are n't many left now .
no they 've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
were there any animals in the forest ?
yes i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . but nowadays you just do n't see the birds that you used to see around here .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs think back .
ok . i 'll come back later .
well i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm i must be getting absentminded .
it 's us .
what do you mean by us ?
well we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we 're talking now are n't we ?
oh yes but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that s something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
what did he say ?
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
oh dear ! what did he tell you to do ?
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
ten days ? would you please repeat it again ?
yes ten days .
yeah but it 's not as hot as i expected .
by the way my name is liu wei .
i 'm sorry but you can t sit on the chair .
what would you like for a drink ?
mr . smith has been changed his name .
hello . this is paula .
well i m a college student . how about you ?
really ? that 's interesting !
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
where do you want to go ?
yes .
i am interested in science fiction .
that would be great .
pardon ?
i mean most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria they are likely to cause immune system problems .
university ? why ? you asked me last year .
oh i forget . sorry .
i went to harvard university .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
god save me ! is there anything wrong with you ? did n't i tell you ?
i 've not known . perhaps i 've got a bad memory .
i did a b . a . in economics . remember ?
terrific ! b . a . again and againb . a .
french dressing please .
i beg your pardon ?
i said i had been to the doctor the day before .
sorry it 's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
will you say it again ?
who 's your manager ? tell me ! would you ?
we could take a few things away from that .
where did you learn english ?
the sky is in the water .
i thought you knew . do you want to pay any ?
i m afraid i have some business to attend to .
just tell me what she 's doing .
okay .
it 's all right .
so sorry .
i went hiking with my parents .
ok . i will take it .
yeah . i get a lot of information on the internet .
well the whole house has been cleaned and we said it .
yeah that 's right .
if you do n't feel better now you 're kidding .
well we have to buy a beautiful view of the park .
i see . i 'll ask my wife to come back for lunch .
really ? well you 're really a hurry .
it 's my pleasure .
i think you 've been making a lot of good dishes . they are very cheap and you 've made for the taste .
that 's fine . well i am glad we do n't have any choice . it 's a vegetarian .
i have n't even gotten a hamburger .
look at your english is doing so well .
yes definitely . that 's why my uncle has a project meeting .
what 's the matter ?
thanks for their help .
the blood test is for cholesterol .
what does it mean ?
it is not easy . first of all you need to learn how to practice with .
what ? whoa !
thanks for your <unk> ! you 're going to start cooking and then go to the club .
yes .
fine ! we had a good time ! where have you been ?
yeah no . welcome . bye .
the shuttle launches are beautiful . i saw one that took off at midnight . the whole sky got bright .
it 's not a big mistake . they have only got a general impression .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
you are right .
no kidding !
great ! you 're kidding ! i m afraid i can t .
what ? we need to get her some rest .
i 'll run into that bathroom .
whatever .
you are kidding ! i just ca n't believe my <unk> .
then what happened ?
wow ! it s good news !
yeah .
i 've been forget about her .
ok let me know if you could handle something to look for ok ?
well i just saw a horror movie last night .
basically i m sure you re a bit out of your team .
that 's not good . let 's go to the end of the summer .
that s a good idea .
thanks .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
yeah but it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that i have heard it hurts a lot !
really ?
yes .
oh i didn t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used <unk> needles and that the place is hygienic .
maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i m sure i ll .
what is he going to be like ?
i have to take my exams for getting into the university so i need to prepare .
oh that 's a pity .
don t worry . i think it s safe . use a fast one more thing .
no . i m fond of snakes . i think they re wonderful .
how about painting a history to watch one more often ?
well you are not in the mood for it . i would n't want to stop by tomorrow .
that s not my fault .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it s really annoying !
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that s why the parking lot was flooded .
i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
not much just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don t know man .
yeah it will be fun ! i have a mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a <unk> that s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
yeah that would be something i don t have to also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa take it easy there <unk> . don t get carried away . these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
thanks mom !
the reality is different you know running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let s do it !
i m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the meters in seconds . that s very fast for a kid his age .
he s not very good at the long jump though is he ?
he s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again that s fine for someone hi
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at longdistance running ?
the <unk> race we run is the meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they re ok . i ask them to swim meters each day . that s lengths of the swimming pool . they re not very fast but that s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of meters .
i d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy to go faster higher and further .
the tall one ? sure that 's drive he works with lily .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
i 'm not sure he is a manager i think .
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
well he has already taken you know that 's his wife right there .
i may have something on that day but thanks for inviting me .
well drop by if you can .
i will do you want me to bring anything ?
no just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
sure when is good time for you ?
can you make it on tuesday ?
what time do you want me there ?
anytime after six will be fine .
all right it 's a date .
of course not i 'd appreciate that .
there are two ways . you can make an appointment with one .
no . i know it does n't cost much .
no i was out . was it worth watching ?
you didn t hear ? spain won two to zero .
oh really ? so spain is through to the next round ?
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
no problem .
no .
i 'm sure to hear that .
i like it very much .
then i made a mistake .
yes .
i hate to say the television is as soon as the weatherman can .
yes .
what time do you want me to put on it ?
really ? can t you stay a little longer ?
no i ca n't . i 've got the flu .
be seeing you then .
see you .
why do you eat at the cafeteria ?
hmm . that 's an excellent idea .
oh but it s just a good idea to do that .
i don t want to eat breakfast instead .
not really but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game .
yes some friends play it all day all night and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
typical francis whether you are at work or engaged in leisure time activities you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
it 's important to keep your mind uptodate and active .
how about your family ?
i never told you that before .
but you heard it was one of the most famous movie .
sounds not bad ! you know the only thing i worried about is the safety . i m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
then you can go to the threedaylong training camp first . there re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i will think about it .
come on ! it is really a fun game .
yeah ! but french is not easy to learn .
ok you 'll ask her .
all right . i ll write about the design and styles .
well going to a cinema visiting the galleries exhibitions and museums finding and meeting old friends exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices .
the problem is that i have all of them are full of fun . i just don t know what to do first .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
actually i m interested in all of them . the more choices we have the harder to make a decision .
toss a coin to decide then .
what 's the problem ?
yes i sure do . i will try to find some other solutions .
nope .
well we can if you ask me .
yes i have . good luck !
yes i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky my application was approved by the manager very soon .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i will help to prepare food feed animals and clean up . i m very excited about it now .
it must be a unique experience . i m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
ok i will bring you photos as many as possible .
hi . steven . i just drop in and want to have a chat with you .
it s a pretty bad idea . i had a gettogether with some children and she was only very busy . so i thought it was playing the game .
i do n't know .
that 's right . i can t afford anything until she has been angry so i wouldn t mind it .
oh that s a nice day .
as long as it is a newcomer you re talking to me .
that s great .
what happened ?
yeah . he s the money .
what s the problem ?
he is a tough husband .
really ? i ve heard about it . by the way who s the chinese teacher ?
i m not sure . besides the chinese new year and i m just not sure what s up with it .
thank you .
i 'm not sure . my wife and me there are a lot of telephone people .
and now ?
we did n't have any child 's parents . my brother lives in washington d . c .
that s very kind of you .
what a shame ! your husband is a housewife .
oh ok i see .
the best .
really ? i did n't think i can ask you one .
yeah .
have you got it . where are you going ?
no this is a new one . i m terribly sorry .
i ll bet you were a little embarrassed .
thanks for telling me this .
i was late getting back from the mall but i 'm hurrying .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said dinner at eight and it 's only sevenfifteen . i do n't want to be the first one there again .
do n't worry . we wo n't be the first time .
the same to you !
i said merry christmas ! do n't you know that christmas is almost here ?
it is ? oh that s nice .
it was nice but i didn t think it was .
of course i did .
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
because i 'm not christian i 'm jewish .
oh i m sorry . i didn t know .
what ? you haven t taken the bus before ?
so what do you do around here ?
well i 'll celebrate hanukah soon but that 's not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i 'll just enjoy the holiday break .
well thanks for inviting me . i ll be glad to bring a christmas party at my house .
not at all . a party is a party .
why do you say that ?
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
well many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
i 've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
sometimes that s true but not usually . most <unk> are honest hardworking professionals . it s hard to keep highly trained people so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .
how much do you make ?
i 'm a gs . that 's high on the scale of workers but even a gs is paid a living wage .
i ve been out of town .
really ? are you still interested in photography ?
i ve been back from paris .
really ? when did you have a look at it ?
yes . i love the third floor .
no i did n't . but i still love it .
hi susan . nice to meet you .
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china but . . .
me ?
are you sure ?
well i live here every year .
i did n't know . i just had it with me last week .
certainly .
just listen to me . i had a really good time .
ok . i 've been here for ages .
no i usually do some exercise .
you speak english though .
what do you need to eat ?
i really don t have my contact with them .
ok . . . here s a present for me .
really ?
really ? well thank you very much .
at the gate .
that s a good idea . you are really trying to find something .
no . we have two older sisters now .
that 's really good . i think i could go to sons now .
tell me how could have such a mother s home ?
i was hoping you would come but i can t understand .
she is a nurse .
i guess you re right .
how long have you waited for it ? i feel terrible . when i only feel well at home i did it .
yes i had to stay at my office for two days . is there anything else i can do to help you with ?
you are right . but we just got lost with each other .
how much is it ?
no i 'm not asking for money i 'm asking for your advice .
oh you 've already grown up son .
no . it 's almost new too .
ok .
sure . i feel better now .
why not ? china is a wonderful country .
will you go with me too ?
no i 'm afraid not now . i 'm too busy .
not yet grandma what 's the matter ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
i 'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
i mean her personality .
i 'm afraid i know less than you do . tell me more about her will you ?
that of the old man .
you 're absolutely right ! that 's the very figure i like best .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
well i like others very much but i really do n't think much of this one .
you do n't like the performance do you ?
yes but i do n't like the story .
oh it 's really a drag .
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
no i have n't . i liked it very much .
it 's a new film star .
what 's the weather like in new york ?
it was a great game .
i think it 's very common and the plot is marvelous .
but he s not too serious .
yes of course . i love the picnic party . it s really family fun time .
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
right she is so excited and simply can t wait .
there are times of games planned should have a grand time .
yes i do .
you know .
yeah you are right .
have you ever tried to watch any fast food ?
yes of course .
that is a good idea i love it . what time do you think is convenient ?
well what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
ok i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don t want to miss it .
i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
it is a great car .
make sure that your air is during tax . i will give you a lot of inconvenience .
they are basically designed by multiplying two categories direct and indirect contaminant sources .
i know . it s convenient to find a common car sometimes .
uh . . . i mostly just like to listen . you 're the groom . why do n't you go first ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you 're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i 'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
it s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it s the evening rush .
it s hard to commute a long way .
sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
i can t stop by myself .
stop picking up . it s normal .
you need to blow off some steam . the world is not on your shoulder .
cool . you 're just jealous about it .
so i have a large one .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
well usually people think i 'm a terrible singer but after we all have a few beers they say i sound a lot better !
well i heard that if you drink enough beer you can speak foreign languages better . . .
it 's a etv palace ! i 'm glad i brought my platinum card .
you wo n't need it . stanley my best man is going to treat everybody !
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor 's party at a etv was n't it ?
if it were up to stanley we 'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
then i bet he 's really good !
well uh i 'll let you decided that for you yourself . he 'll be here a little later . here 's our room .
ok i 'll go .
i see .
of course . it is the tradition .
it 's really beautiful .
i like autumn too . where i 'm from autumn is the best time of year .
i like hot as long as it gets more .
well i have to leave from the airport .
oh yes . i like the color of canada too .
yes it is . but it 's nice in spring and fall .
i understand .
we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks but apart from that summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again so most people don t mind then .
i want to cool down some snow .
it 's a beautiful city .
what are the winter going to be like tomorrow ?
all right . thank you .
you are right . many people just can t seem to be willing to their fast food .
yes i am . i am from south america .
how old is it ?
it s a new home .
love me too .
yes it is lovely . i have been expecting something like this for a long time . thanks ever so much .
that 's all right .
thanks . there are three bedrooms a living room a kitchen and a bathroom .
thanks a lot .
oh really ? i usually just like it because of this film .
but then why not ?
but i m still interested in finding one now .
but you have to stay here with the bus .
it s very nice of you to me .
i am glad you like it .
the same to you !
are you going anywhere ?
we 're having some friends over . what are you doing ?
oh . i 'm just going to take it easy .
ok . where should we go ?
why do n't we go down to the pool ? it 's not too far from here .
that s fine . i ll be ready in a minute .
thanks . you too !
do you have any plans ?
well my family 's away and i ca n't afford to do much . what about you ?
oh i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .
yes of course . it was nice to see you .
it was nice to see you too . and please give my regards to mrs . robbins .
i went to play tennis in the public park .
how often do you play tennis ?
twice a week . how about you ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
do you like watching football matches ?
yes i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
he s fixing the door .
what happened ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
that must be a number of years .
i do n't think so . it s kind of sore .
how about a warning on your nose ?
it 's a doctor .
it certainly makes the best choice .
you must have been married for three years .
but she is not your wife 's mother .
yeah . she 's really pretty .
oh boy . she is unbelievable .
you mean she is going to be my own wedding ?
i wonder why .
well it 's just that i think if you do n't enjoy doing something any more you should stop doing it .
i hope he makes everything easier .
yes he does . but if you think you were right he would n't .
maybe it is for the best .
yes i 've been feeling a little bit too long . but the exercise has been a long time to learn a little longer .
oh how can i ever forget that ?
it 's just a moment . i 'm sorry .
where is that anyway ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i 'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
oh really ?
oh she is also very wanna .
no but she ended up finding out later that night .
that 's beside the point .
i do n't know .
all right . no one . you 're in the kitchen .
i know . . . you re right .
yes mary .
hi david come in .
nothing really .
well that 's life .
he said he had a bad cold .
why did n't you choose her to go ?
she s gorgeous .
you could never tell me .
well she is all right .
there was a stop sign on the police .
oh that 's not the idea . hey it 's already pm .
thank you .
i 'm still not sure whether i can afford that .
i do n't know .
oh she s too bad . i ll see you later .
yes we are .
she is our th wedding anniversary .
what is your date of birth ?
oh . i have decided to meet him at the same time .
how about that one ?
oh yes .
i think so .
yes . that s when the daughter gets married and her exboyfriend are .
is she going to be there before ?
they said that the wedding room is coming to shanghai on the south side of the river .
i 'm really sorry . i thought he 'd come back to .
that s crazy .
i guess so . while growing up i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year .
the city is beautiful the off . . . the offices are modern and comfortable and the work is so interesting .
he is a shoulder to me .
that s right . if you ask around other people will tell you the same thing .
but how can i prevent it from worrying about my life ?
what time do you want to go ?
what 's the matter ?
no what do you mean ?
how about the advice ?
the contract says your company is working on it .
what happened to him ?
i never thought that there is some kind of people even though .
really ? so you are not surprised when your company comes to work ?
good luck .
oh i am not surprised .
what ?
can i have some medicine please ?
i am not interested in trying it .
you mean a cook ? no one can i do it ?
i love this kind of work .
not at all . she was really surprised . i thought she was going to put me down .
you should know a guy . you could be more careful about him .
i know what you mean . you could do something different from your company .
ok . let me do it for you .
my pleasure . take care .
that would be great . actually can i get your phone number ella ? that 's assuming you do n't mind if i call you sometime .
anytime . you can reach me at .
ok got it . i will call you sometime next week .
fine .
i haven t seen you for several days .
bye jason .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
she has been admitted to yale with a scholarship .
really ? that 's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
thank you .
my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i ca n't find it now .
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
yes i kept on typing it until midnight but it is lost .
do n't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let 's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
yes but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
how about the shelf ?
i 've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
do n't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
i have been working on it for a whole month and it 's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ?

i 'll miss you too my friends .
yes i 've seen some of them in the newspaper . it was a real letdown .
maybe the problem is n't coming .
well i know that this kind of exercise is really hard for me .
sure . let 's go .
no i haven t .
are you interested in reading them ?
absolutely .
well it was a hard time to get along with the people who arrived early . so far i 'm going to have to write up the best price for their own use .
i have no idea about that .
i 'll give you a suggestion .
i need help turning them on .
let 's take a look at that .
i love you . do you often come here to dance ?
really ? good luck !
i like popular music best .
it depends on the job . how can i help ?
hmm . . . well it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake or can we just alter it ?
yeah .

of course he is really using his wife .
good idea . i prefer it now .
how come ?
do you remember years ago when everybody at the new year 's party had yoyos ?
i 'm going to need to see your id .
boy can i know what you want ?
i appreciate your understanding .
it s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
well the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game . it s time to play ball !
roger vargas is up at bat .
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
the players are scrambling to get the ball . vargas gets to first base and he s still going ! the outfielder throws it to second ! vargas slides ! he s safe !
great play !
we have a runner on third and up at bat is brian okapi ! there s the pitch he hits it ! it s going going that ball is gone !
home run by okapi ! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium !
well i have the day off from work .
that s great ! do you have any plans ?
well i ve been working so hard lately so i ll probably just take it easy .
sounds nice .
yeah i ll probably just stay in and relax . maybe watch a few movies .
can i stop by ?
sure . any time .
it must be . let me have another look . a third one he won t be able to make it .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
what 's the point ?
what s the matter with you ?
what 's the weather like in your country ?
i feel that they are often too excited about what they want .
surely ? i think he is too excited to meet her .
might be but i think he might be really hot as well .
can you give me a call ?
i ca n't help it .
maybe not . the situation is to find out more important than the others .
i feel i 've had some friends from you .
i 'll take care of everything .
if you 're staying at the hotel you would like .
yes i have .
what kind of antivirus software do you use ?
have you got a club card ?
pretty is she ?
i hope so .
i really like you .
thanks . you 're right . it must be someone who are you nice .
what kind of people do you want to give any meat ?
ok thank you . i 'll buy your breakfast .
i know i 'm late . i 'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you but your phone seems to be disconnected .
my phone ?
yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service .
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes it 's dead . there 's no dial tone .
so i could n't get through . i knew i 'd be late because my car would n't start . it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that 's why i 'm late .
but this is terrible . i 'm expecting important calls .
about what ?
my exam .
well the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
do you have a cell phone ?
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor 's house and use their phone .
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it is n't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes of course i can drive you . so you do n't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
yes i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house then we 'll just return here . but if not i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it s very important to me .
alright let 's go .
yes let 's go .
are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the <unk> exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .
what are you talking about ? how can we do this ?
well to begin with gambling is addictive ruins marriages destroys families and <unk> communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction .
geez ! now that i think about it maybe legalizing gambling isn t such a good idea ! although i have been to las vegas and i didn t become addicted or anything like that .
you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me i have a protest rally to organize !
wow ! it s just your fault !
it s right . i ve got a bad headache .
well this is my first time we ve had these days .
they are really nice . . . well maybe we can find out everything .
well that s not what my friends are you going to have to buy me a pair of two things .
you re right . i am so sorry about this !
come on ! i ll see you off at five .
yes that s it ? i know she is a beautiful piece of cake .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay . . .
i 'm afraid i have n't got one in your size .
what ? why ? i mean we ve had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we re happy together aren t we ?
that s just it i m not happy anymore tim . it s not you it s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so what are you saying ? you re breaking up with me because i m perfect ?
tim you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh i could say that i ll be all you need but that would be a lie . i know i d only hurt you i know i d only make you cry .
baby come on . don t do this to me ! whatever it is we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together ! don t leave me .
i can t tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i m only doing this for you . i don t really wanna go but deep in my heart i know this is the <unk> thing to do .
laura . . .
do you like this place ?
what s the problem ?
oh yeah it s a lovely day . i ve got an appointment with a doctor s for today .
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
well you know .
okay i m taking the shirt .
i m very sorry to hear that .
i 'm glad you 're right .
that s for sure !
yeah this is a very good idea .
have you bought anything yet ?
it is called the gold necklace . i had been there before .
you ca n't believe it ! i just hope he ll drive you as soon as he gets sick .
that 's crazy .
yeah you know ! now you re right we had the tickets to go with us .
what are you cooking now ?
well it s nothing .
i 'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
i do n't know . i 'm pretty full . what are we having ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
ooh that 's my favorite . maybe i 'll have a small slice .
great . would you like coffee or tea with that ?
i 'll have a cup of tea .
do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
actually could i have some milk with that ?
definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ?
skim please . that 'd be very nice . thanks . . . oh no . janna i 'm so sorry but i 've got to go .
what happened ?
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will
i 'll go with you . where is she ?
she 's on the m near reading .
is she alright ?
i do n't know she did n't say . i 'm so sorry about this .
do n't worry . family comes first . come on let 's go .
actually i 've only got a twoseater . i 'll have to go on my own .
ok . just call me if you need anything then .
i will . thanks a lot .
yes are you ?
i 've got my money and my keys so i 'm ready .
you do know that it 's absolutely freezing out do n't you ? i 'd put a coat on if i were you .
it was n't cold out this morning .
well it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
it does actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
that 's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail does n't dent it .
ok . i 'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it 's a bit chilly in here .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
i do n't know . the weatherman did n't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it 's supposed to get worse .
i do n't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
if i 'm not back in ten minutes come and find me .
alright . i 'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
there are several good ways to help . i ll go and catch the police .
that s fine . i m sure she ll be happy to hear what she looks like . . .
don t worry . i m sure he ll be here . i ll call you back later .
look ! i m not ready to watch the break ! you ve been watching movies out with are a yellow level as well .
thank you for seeing me .
oh and it s very easy to play .
all right .
where do we put the dishes together ?
no the one next to it .
thanks !
yes i see . thank you .
where did i find it ?
i 'm afraid there is no doubt that .
what s the matter ? i ve always wanted to discuss this course .
all right .
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
oh i see .
then what 's the chicken tastes like ?
howdy folks and welcome to today s game ! you know rick today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know the winner will move on to the finals .
that s right and it looks like we re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the faceoff . . . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
maurice richard has the puck now and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
alright the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
what an amazing goal !
oh great !
no i did n't . it s a most expensive job .
he has a fever .
no one has informed me of that my <unk> seems to be the housewife .
i ran it as an emergency room .
well if i were you i 'd go over to the mall .
i 'm off to barcelona for a week .
do you have your passport with you ?
yes here you go . i do n't need a visa to go to spain do i ?
fortunately for you you do n't . next time if you have any questions about <unk> you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that 's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes there 's one left .
ok . i 'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that 's your only piece of luggage it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do n't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes please . that 's a fantastic idea .
you 're here a bit early so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here 's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
oh .
wait a second . he shoots he scores !
yes it would be . i can go right now . she knows that i 'm going to the office .
how long does it take ?
the train ? will i be flying back then ?
oh no . we 've bought your return ticket for you . i think you 'll find it comfortable .
will the train be very crowded ?
oh no . the train has n't been crowded at all recently . besides you 're in firstclass so you 'll be fine .
when is the first meeting then ?
they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for
all right . i 'll make sure and check my reservations are all right ?
we 've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings so you wo n't need to deal much with the transportation system .
that 's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ?
that 's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you do n't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
i am . i just went to the travel agent s and picked up these brochures .
where are you planning on going ?
i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ?
i went a long time ago before they built the new train that can take you there .
would you recommend going there for a few days ?
personally i think it d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
you re right . what do you think about <unk> ?
it s a beautiful city but i think it s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
i d like to get away from the big city life .
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
i guess if i only have a few days i should probably think about going somewhere that isn t so far away .
since the may holiday is the high season you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here s the phone number .
thanks i ll give them a call later .
wow ! what a great movie !
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
she 's a real turnon alright ?
and look out she 's dressed .
yeah i noticed . she must be really loaded .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
lucky her . anyway i think that is just as beautiful .
i think you 've lost it .
well that 's my opinion .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly .
at least we agree on that . let 's go and get a drink .
it was fantastic but i 'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
where did you end up going ?
because it 's offseason we got a really good package deal to paris so we went there .
i 've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
sure . what 's this one a picture of ?
oh that 's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i 'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
you do n't look very happy in that picture .
no by that time i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries cathedrals fountains statues and palaces !
so what did you do ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees watched a movie and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
of course ! you ca n't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though .
that 's what everyone says ! i ca n't wait to see it for myself some day .
i 'm fine . how about yourself ?
yeah you are going to the club . look at this one . it 's easy to see them .
yes i have . i started an article about a few months ago .
oh i see . they say raising marriage is quite different for today .
well it is <unk> you know .
really ? i 'm surprised .
ms . jordan is a huge world .
i wonder if my company could have done that .
yeah we have to keep up with the true thing . the one we need to see is to do is must stay in bed for a long time .
really ? too bad for each other .
i feel they are playing the piano .
yeah it 's just a good way to save money .
right . his son is more important than him .
yeah it seems to be a good idea .
you do a good job .
i 'd love to the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before has n't he ?
yeah a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok let 's go in sandy .
she is at home .
hmm . things are just as clever as you say in china .
i feel they 're dirty .
you are right . but americans can learn english well .
actually he 's a good teacher .
the national anthem is behind the corner . oh they are subject to law .
yes chinese people may have some . but i 'm afraid many women are very different . so i 'll try to make a lot of grammar ones .
i am afraid i do n't like them . so i 'll have to write you a report about the american women .
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
really ? i will ask her .
she 's my wife .
what happens to them ?
yes . that is why we have been trying to buy some new products for all the family .
i 'll be happy to look at it .
he had a finger in the pie .
you are kidding . that will put up smoking in the overhead bin .
ok . i want to go into the us .
me too . i m sorry to hear that . see you after class ?
well now there is the line . have you ever tried it ?
i washed my clothes for less time .
ok you guys don t have much luck .
i did n't realize it was a choice .
i think you are right . but we need to learn more quickly than others .
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
he is going to be a little worried about the bedroom .
sure they re .
why do you mean that ?
and i know that you have spent a lot of time together . people in different departments get married too .
yes i do . please fill in the form and we can send it to us .
the company has a great plan for breakfast . we just want to make sure that it 's acceptable to us .
how about the dessert ?
no i m going to the gym where you see the movie is now .
maybe we can find something for our party . i know you could do it .
what is the most important thing for you to help me with ?
no way ! i guess we can keep it .
well i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and i 'm going to end up getting stuck in rushhour traffic .
that s great .
they 're going to be great . i 'll go to dinner .
that 's great . i 've already been wanting to make a decision about it . and then i 'm not sure i can do it .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often and centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
the summer temperature usually often reaches about or in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter .
what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about or degrees .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
yeah we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog is that true ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city are they ?
yes they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again .
have you ever had snow in your city ?
my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city .
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go iceskating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
as you know my city is on the coast . the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
is it really completely flat ?
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over meters high in your country .
yes there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
that doesn t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast but few people lives on them .
there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers but only a few lakes .
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of <unk> especially by water .
there s some but i don t think it s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime burglary and car theft . there s very little major crime .
it s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
that happens in many places . in my city there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes but i don t know if that s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money they will not think of stealing from others .
that s possible but i m not sure it would really happen like that .
i ve been to most of the countries in europe several countries in asia china japan korea and thailand and to the united states and canada .
i thought you had been to australia too .
no but i m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ve been to ?
i think i 'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords waterfalls and mountains .
isn t it really cold there ?
well the north of norway is almost always cold but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it s a wet country so there s snow almost everywhere in winter .
i ve been to other scandinavian countries but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
what do you mean ?
the company must follow the bridge .
americans love their cars .
certainly .
so what can i do now ?
well i know that he would never stab me in the back . but i 've seen him double cross other people .
yes you are right . how about the weather ?
oh i love them !
it was the middle of summer .
it seems you 're very fond of it .
not always . but they like good meal .
yes . mixed food is more than i 've had spaghetti .
really ?
what do you want to watch it ?
i m going to the hospital .
that 's great . but what 's the film like ?
if you ever need anything else please let me know .
it thought about a film .
yes i do .
there 's a great sitcom on channel .
i do n't know .
well take care of yourself . i 'm going to get over and get some rest for a while .
we may go abroad my wife wants to go to egypt and i 'd like to go there too . we have n't made up our mind yet .
oh dear . it 's always . how old is it ?
yes . it 's glad to have her in my class .
what do you mean by airmail ?
i do n't .
you should come to the park in the morning .
what will you do ?
no i 'll have a lot of money .
what 's the difference ?
i 'm going to turn it on .
he can always use lipstick and press them into the same slot .
so it 's easy to learn when they are in china .
yes i like the kind of music .
really ? congratulations !
really ? how long won ?
it was quite exciting traveling . the old city had better than ten years ago .
yeah . i could n't understand the kids and all the friends were bunch of fun . how about you ?
you had too much time .
but he is always taking the walk .
and you could work overtime at night ?
i took off pictures of the first thing to save money .
i see .
i did n't know . i ll have to give a try .
who did this happen ?
i must to ask you to reconsider your decision .
oh yes . i am sorry for that .
did you see his face ?
let 's sleep five more minutes .
you are right .
ok . i 'll just water and warm up !
i know . i 've got an idea of it .
i 'll go with you and bring something to drink . hey do you have some money on getting a shopping skirts ?
of course i will try my best .
oh dear ! i 'll introduce you when we were at .
thanks . if i had something like that i 'd buy .
that s fine .
oh they 're all right .
yesterday . he s a great couple of years ago .
i had no idea .
that 's a good idea .
we have to admit it .
ok . please go ahead .
it was cat .
do we need our overcoats ?
if only one person who took care of it .
that 's fantastic .
what do you need to know ?
they 're sorry about that . there 's a big fight in the park .
sure . it 's a lovely trip .
how s it ?
i 'm very busy .
no . why ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
really ? is that right ?
that s so unfair !
whose name did you pick ?
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
booze !
yeah you re right . can t go wrong with that .
that 's too bad . is it true to use wooden cases ?
a plane ? no one is so smart . i did n't think it was wrong .
she had to go to the hospital .
oh it s really necessary . just give her a message for her .
you are so excited . nobody won a prize in the last month .
i hope my everything is too cold .
oh really ? i ll go shopping at home and we can meet at the park tomorrow night .
let s see . . . you know i bought it yesterday afternoon .
sure . i ve never seen a dragon boat race .
really ? i think you ll love it .
as long as i don t have to row .
thanks . actually i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you ve been doing some great work !
i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office .
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
i can understand .
ok i am sure if you need anything just let me know .

thanks frank . i d love to come . when is it ?
her birthday is on the th . we re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant and then maybe go out dancing .
sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
that s fine . don t forget to keep your date with your wife .
by the way how many people have this week ?
i need to know that it wo n't be a problem .
i m glad you can t help me !
do you have any children ?
the palace hotel .
i hope you have any luck .
that s very expensive . we don t want to have a look at it .
i think so .
as you know china has a singlechild policy . therefore there s just my husband my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older they ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
no i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
how long have you been married ?
i have been married for three years .

that 's terrible . what did you do ?
you need to make sure .
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
yes i need to refill it today .
alright . i 'm sorry miss . according to our file this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i could n't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor but he is out of town . so i ca n't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i 've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
i 'm sorry miss . we ca n't do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i 'll have another prescription .
miss i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it s the law . i ca n't do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i 'm sorry miss . it 's the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss i just ca n't help you on this . i 'm a pharmacist not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i 'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .

oh that 's great . where are the classes ?
well if you want to look professional serious and more conservative a blue dress white shirt and nottoohigh shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company s dress code .
indeed i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably i should put on car key and simple shirt .
whatever you choose make sure they are neat and clean .

you may consider the position of life in a team of experience and during the period .

i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i m sure something can be worked out .
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
ok . i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .

how long do you have in mind ?

i need to use the internet .
he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
wow . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative .
yes it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .

that s not a good idea . you must get tired of work too .
that 's true .
there is a time to learn your life . take a look at these photos .
you re right . i can t see the name of the company .
it s easy i ve got a lot of practical experience and professional skills . i think she should require as a professional assistant .
what kind of business are you talking about ?
you are kidding !
that is not the only thing i should pay . maybe you some other questions .

i graduated from peking university .

i like business management and i think it 's very useful for the present work .
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ?
i 've taken courses on office administration reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
all right madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by percent and profit margins from percent to percent .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?

i can speak the language better than i read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of englishspeaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work . i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm .
well mr . parsons as i mentioned before i m someone who needs new challenges . i m really focused and hardworking . i think my academic results prove this .
yes true but how about other personal qualities ?
well i believe i m a good teamplayer but i can also work well independently . i m very enthusiastic and well i hope my colleagues would agree i m fun to work with .
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
hmm that s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
yes that s right . to be honest the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating .
so what changed ?
well slowly but surely i proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
wow a real step up !
yes i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent years in that position but to be honest it wasn t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in longterm .
i see so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i just felt that the paper couldn t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
yes that s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in .
yes i m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that s right . i ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i m a bit of a bookworm but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
well i ve always wanted to attend an apartment on holiday so i decided to put my name and let him go .
well i ve always been keen on writing so i became the editor for the university student magazine which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i m sure . okay now let s move on to your work experience shall we ?
yes okay .

yes i 'd like to give it a try .
all right . you need to have an interview with our manager mr . mcbride . let 's go to his office .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism and this seemed like a g
certainly . and after your internship ?
they seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in right .
yes that s right . i moved to london and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london .
the london weekly right .
yes in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
thank you very much . i ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes i do have a number of questions but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes of course . well as you can see from the resume i m and grew up in brooklyn new york although our family moved to london when i was quite young at around .
ah i see so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i m really looking to settle down .
i see . okay well let s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
either call this extension number or ask them to send the fax to you as email you print it out .

it s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok home or office address ?
office address please . he might be at work when they arrive .

yes it s right .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i didn t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
be careful the cartridge can be very hot .
well all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents information and other things .
what are they ?
one study said that lowincome groups have a higher percentage of overweight people than higher income families .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

no problem if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now let s hear more about these chocolates you re offering .
well as you know i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bonbons here in the united states . they re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand <unk> many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant luxurious first class dining .
mmmm . . . gourmet chocolates where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here i brought these especially for you try one !
oh thanks . mmm hmm creamy texture very smooth . . .
unique aren t they ? i bet you ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the <unk> make it through inspection .
yes very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy very unique that s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the <unk> family for generations . i m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk <unk> beans sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what s haggis ?
it s a traditional scottish delicacy you take sheep s liver heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep s stomach .

i understand . what should i tell mr . morley ?
why not just tell him i 'm sick ? i 'll ring him myself this afternoon .
alright . have you been to see a doctor ?
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway i have a flu . i know what it is . i do n't need a doctor to tell me that .
do you think you 'll be able to come in tomorrow ? or should i call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
i 'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it 's probably better if you do n't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
it 's rainy weather today . maybe it 's better if you just stay inside . make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .

it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well . mary had promised to be my date but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .
yeah you re right . we aren t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo s with low copays and good coverage . the deductibles are low too .
sounds good although do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well we don t have any preexisting illnesses or conditions so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years .
i ve been out of town . nothing really .
thanks honey ! that s all i had to say .
i have a bad idea .
oh dear .
unfortunately he 's going to europe .
do you think you can buy a lot of money on the top of it ?
all right .
really ? how could i ?
did you have a good journey ?
honey i m sorry to hear that . i 'll tell you that our price is almost reasonable .
that 's too bad . what will it be ?
i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy but i m falling in love with you veronica .
i know . you ve always been such a big purchase .
i think of a man who is eighteen !
is that all ?
well i was hoping we could give you a few more information about the school .
for the past week we are trying to put a new product in the market .
sure what do you need to do there ?
there s problem with my bank statement . there s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
i have to exchange some money .
that s right . you re going away next week .
i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don t pay it soon the credit card company will charge me interest .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
for sure ! i didn t really understand some of the technical <unk> they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us .
like what ?
well they mentioned how people put away money in something called a k ?
yeah i know it sounds weird but a k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a k you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that s interesting and logical i guess .
that s a bit unstable don t you think ?
yeah but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial <unk> so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
i ve been thinking of doing that lately !
hi i need to transfer some money to another account . it s urgent .
okay have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
no . i ve never made a transfer before .
it s alright i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
okay i ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank s address and phone number .
i have it at all .
well . you ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it s a simple transaction and we can process it today .
oh that s such a relief . i didn t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much .
it s my pleasure .
yeah i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
very well here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let s say ten thousand dollars how much will i have to pay each month ?
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don t default on a payment !
it sounds good but there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score .
that is a very serious problem you see the bank must assess your personal information past loans assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
you know what ? i do not really need the money . thanks anyways !
hello welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine talking to me like i m an idiot . . .
please input your <unk> pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal .
yeah yeah i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
danger ! the first thing is that you want to buy an <unk> .
no no no ! stupid machine what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
that sounds good . please take a look at this box .
hmm . maybe i 'll have a round trip ticket .
yes . if you re interested in other staff we do not have any children .
very well . i 'll give you our price by percent discount as soon as possible .
how about percent ?
maybe i 'll give you another idea .
yes that s right . i ve had one for our check .
in the market our business has been having an excellent reduction for years .
