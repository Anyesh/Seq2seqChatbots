seriously ?
that 's convenient .
i appreciate you telling me .
that 's cool .
we 've been on this bus for a while now .

that s a little complicated . you ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people s life . guess what ? even harvard university which is a highly academic institution is in a sense the product of religion .
really ?
many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
oh i see .
it 's weekend again i 'm glad i can arrange for my personal matters .
what do you mean by that ?
yes . . . with flying colors !
what does that mean ?
if you like the class this much already i m sure you will .
i hope so .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
that 's too much for us really .

here you go .
what can i do for you ?
if you like you can apply right now .
that would be great .
then i will take your picture for your passport .
how long will it take ?
that looks great but i will also need your driver 's license or other form of i . d .

thank you . it 's our first date . i hope it 's not too offensive .
congratulations on your success .
thank you .
i 'm sick of it too .
it 's no use complaining . if we had got enough money we could n't put up with it and would have moved out .
not much except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
she loves to nitpick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she 's around .
for example ?
yeah . you know what dave just said ?
what ?
can i help you ?
can i see the receipt ?
yes here you are .
the academy is an important part of the education system .

they 're discussing whether they should replace miss smith the music teacher .
why ?
but a taxi costs too much .
now that i look back at it it waws n't that big a deal . i should n't have lost my temper .
really ? what happened ?
last time when we had dinner at the smith 's it was a horrible experience . he had no manners at all !
oh really ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
i tried to ask the bank teller why it changed but she did n't speak english well enough . so i decided to go to the magazine shop . the one around the corner . and i bought an american newspaper .
what happened ?
yes and you know what ?
what ?
are you ready ?
in just three weeks and i am excited . but there are still a few things i need to do before i go .
like what ?
i ca n't believe it i had faith in bob and he let me down .
i know what you mean .
really ?
get changed !
well i would say that i m just drifting here in the pool .
why ?
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
be quiet will you ?
can you give him a call on his mobile ?
what are you doing this weekend ?
are you free tonight ?
do you have change for a hundred ?
it sells almost everything you can see in the department .
where are you going ?
come on in . make yourself at home .
bye . take care .
i see . i believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to beijing to watch the games .
how annoying !
what 's the matter ?
i will thanks for your concern .
what 's going on ?
there is a position i 've had my eye on for several months now and i had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking .
so what happened ?
yeah you are right . internet makes our lives easier . but it 's a twoblade sword .
what do you mean ?
sounds interesting i have n't gone boating for some time now and what time ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
great . i look forward to meeting you .
see you then .
but what ? just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue but also a great revenue .
hi how are you doing ?
hello !
is that the boxoffice ?
yes .
wang min . telephone number is 13811658 . can i pick the tickets this afternoon ?
yes of course .
yes . i like winter .
me too .
i like the kid . he 's so lovely .
how old is he ?
well it 's hard to say . for the fields and rivers winter is a relaxing season but for farmers i think they might take a rest physically but mentally they are still busy thinking planning and calculating for the working of the next year .
what do you like to do in your spare time ?
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
was he out with the guys from the bank ?
yes i think so .
oh yes well he tried to climb in through the bathroom window but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . the neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress so they called the police .
oh no .
well that 's a bit of a tricky situation .
well first of all the taxi that was taking me from the client 's office to the airport broke down on the freeway .
oh no .
yes and the driver did n't speak any english or chinese and he did n't have a phone on himcan you believe it ? and his radio did n't work . so there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .
so what did you do ?
well i 'm setting my watch at four . thank you .
well you 'll see .
ok .
ok an englishman a scotsman and an irishman were going on a trip across the desert and they could only take one thing with them .
i see .
the giants ?
yeah .
a little but the rush was worth it .
tell me about it .
wow you 're really informative . thanks a lot .
do you have anything to do after this ?
no i do n't .
shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
that sounds like a good idea .
i would n't say so .
what do you mean ?
do you ? by the way could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ?
no problem .
thank you . come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . i 'll have the pictures ready by then .
it seems that you are an optimistic man who does n't dismay easily . that is what a good salesman needs . good luck .
thank you .

which season do you like best ?
i like spring .
why ?
what happened ?
i do n't know .
we 'd better go out for a walk .
which season do you like best ?
i dislike it most .
why ?
john my father is n't there at all . are you kidding ?
government is making efforts to change situation .
he ran four miles and came back dead beat .
how dare you speak to me like this .
do n't cover up your sadness . let it go .
i 'm sorry .
i feel pity for the old man .
i was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
that sounds great .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
it was so kind of you .
hi how are you doing ?
hello . could i speak to justin please ?
speaking .
my mother likes to split hairs .
what do you mean by that ?
you don t know that i have been overprotected by my mother these years . i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings .
we must set 1000 dollars aside each month .
why ?
but i . . . i do n't agree with that because computers weaken kids ability to think because kids do n't learn basic skills .
what do you mean ?
i am . whatsmore his wife is 84 .

that s right .
i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . i ll leave you their phone number .
okay thanks a lot . you did me a great favor just now .
do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy ?
what do you mean ?
it 's great . i really get to focus on what i like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . however i 'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
what happened ?
well every department is different . you would n't want your new coworkers to think you 're a grinch right ?
what is that ?
right congratulations .
every year the south has the floods . it is an act of god .
do you really think so ?
think in some way it is an act of god but in another way it just is caused by us .
for example ?
well we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the workout plan for your needs .
what else ?
do you have any hobbies ?
of course bamboo !
that 's right .

yes of course .
on their bus or in your own cars and you wo n't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region .
why not ?
that makes sense . but that sounds interesting . is there one in beijing too ?
yes .
how do you think they could be ended ?
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that for me each advantage has its own disadvantage .
what do you mean ?
i m sure that science will explain everything eventually . i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
for example ?
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re driving .
well . i like the thom birds best .
yes but they are used for other things too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
yes ?
of course his machine must have been connected to a computer .
but i . . . i do n't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids 'ability to thinkbecause kids do n't learn basic skills .
what do you mean ?
well he s got dark hair and brown eyes .
yes .
it 's the end of the world for me .
what makes you say that ?
do n't loose heart . everything will be fine .
no . i d better not .
why not ?
no no a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i m going to describe someone s face and you guess who it is !
