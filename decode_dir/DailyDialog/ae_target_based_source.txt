i saw on tv that there is an entertainment item bungee in beijing longtanhu park . except that the height is not exiting enough .
the highest bungee spot in the world is located in mount kikicama south africa which is 216 meters high . a cable car in a scenic spot in switzerland is 160 meters high .
i know that frenchmen installed the bungee cord between two tall buildings .
it is said that bungee was originally a grownup ceremony of the indigenous people of new guinea . people stood on branches of the tree which was over 30 meters high . their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . when they almost reached the ground they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently .

hello ?
hello ? mr . bernie . my name is lisa . i hope i m not disturbing you . i just heard about your daughter . i wanted to call you and tell you how much we ll miss her .
i m sorry . i think you are calling the wrong person . my name is not mr . bernie .
sure he can . he can shake hands roll over and even play dead .
oh yes he is . when he was a puppy he liked to chew my father 's shoes but he 's okay now .
that sounds like my cat . she likes to scratch the couch with her claws .
really ? why is that ?
she 's not a housecat . she stays outside most of the time .
thank you .
maybe you could have a look at this one .
i think it fits you . it flatters your figure .
is there anything i can do for you ?
this one is the latest . how do you like it ?
silk . you have a good taste . it 's excellent for its handiness elegance and beauty .
ange can your dog do any tricks yet ?
see he 's wagging his tail .
thank you .
by the way there 's a barber shop in the shopping center too .
thank you .
i do n't feel like breakfast . i do n't feel like anything . why are we so unlucky ? it 's as if there were a jinx on us .
neither . i drove a hard bargain with the vendor before i got the price down .
three hundred ! that 's daylight robbery . how dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? without hesitation i gave my offerno more than fifty .
she must be fuming with anger at such a bid was n't she ?
not at all ! she 's really been around and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . that 's the trade . she only demanded a higher bid saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . she was lying ! then i inquired may i have it at sixty ? she waved her head .
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it 's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
is that so ? i 'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it 's the norm of free trade . the seller sets a preposterous price and the buyer tries his best to bring it down until a compromise is reached . yet you ignored the process . no wonder you ended up easy prey .
are you ready pa ?
no .
your daughter will be back soon . i 'm going to start making dinner . you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like . we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen . the remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair .
ok well we 're going to make a pan of lasagne a salad and some garlic bread . here 's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
a lorry overturned on the road and blocked it so all the traffic was held up .
yeah traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . if we had gone early we would miss the traffic .
i agree with you . but now we have to wait . the sky is overcast and it is very sultry . i fear a thunder storm is brewing .
julia julia julia . my daring julia what 's wrong with you ?
i was thinking about the accident i saw in the morning . i was petrified when two cars collided . i witnessed the traffic accident .

you 're not sure ? you were going at 90 miles per hour ! that 's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! have you been drinking ?
i can t believe the cost of apartments in new york city .
you need to go to the allied irish bank which is near the local shopping centre dunned stores .
cross the road and turn left at the other side . walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . you will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left .
i see .
i 'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
yeah it looks that way . my wife has been bugging me about it . i thought we could probably survive without one but with a baby on the way maybe it is time to get a car .
yeah . i still remember my first car . it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17 . i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
this house is very nice for me but i can t afford it in a lump sum .
how long will it take ?
yes .
it s 240 a month .
yes . it has one bedroom a large living space and 4 kitchens .
it sounds great . how much is the rent ?
and do you know where the national bank is ?
why is that ?
is she old or young ?
what am i going to do ?
guess what gilly ? i won both bids .
yeah . it was so easy and superfast once i figured it out .
we 'd like to sign a yearlong contract if that 's ok .
we 'll sign our signatures too . and give you our passport numbers along with our arc numbers .
i can take two thousand off . that 'll make the rent twentyeight thousand .
ann stop bugging jess and help me order something new . lattes are so passe these days .
go with a hammerhead thenespresso mixed with drip coffee .

that is a wonderful choice .
sorry i can t ! i have to go to work pick up jake and maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class .
you sound exhausted . maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! she can pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool activities . she can also help you do some household chores and run some errands .
oh i don t know . . . it s hard to find the right nanny . you have to consider her previous work experience the responsibilities you give her and how she interacts with the kids . i would love to have someone to help me out though .
i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you won t have to juggle such a busy schedule and you ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great nanny amy . she used to work for my neighbors before they moved away . she s very responsible a good cook and great with kids .
hello sir what can i do for you today ?
what can i do for you today ?
unfortunately yes . it will be clear early saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . there is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the southeast . folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls .
it gets better on sunday though . the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . it will still be rather cool with highs in the low 50s . the west coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather but at least the sun will come out . i advise weekend travelers to be careful especially while driving . back to you mark .
is the furniture crafted well ?

ginseng comes in 6 different grades . it runs from 5000 to 30000 nt a jin .

whew ! that sounds more like my price range . i 'll take two liangs .
that 's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! people say that if you eat them you will have your first son very soon !
gui yuan are lucky too ! if you eat them you 'll have a very sweet life !

i think that the apartment looks very nice but i do see some problems .

i was thinking of a brown pinstriped suit .

i like the one on the left but i do n't like the pattern on it . it 's too much . i want a pattern that 's a bit subtler .
how about this one ?
i have no idea .
caesar salads are good .
i always make my salads with shredded cheese croutons and almonds .
please let me point out the chef 's special which is blackened catfish .

they 're similar to an avocado . when the outside feels soft they 're ripe .
i had no idea .
thank you .
that 's right .
that sounds like a good deal .
i don t understand why .
it goes all the way there .
you 're right .

how long will it take to get the regular one ?
let me take your temperature with a thermometer .
ok . and i d like to check these books out .
han maimed what 's your plan for the weekend ?
oh my god ! john i didn t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook like leonard in the big bang theory .
come on han maimed don t make a fuss . a lot of americans including many scientists believe in religion .
absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england .
why was it founded by the puritans ? where were the atheistic educators ?
because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans .
that s because in the 16th and 17th century there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
yes that 's why puritans moved to the new world where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on it was these puritans who founded harvard college .
many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
in 1639 it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly johnharvard himself was a clergyman .
it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
therefore it s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion there would note harvard .
religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s .
they were not too bad . i really liked my polisci class .
i do n't know if i would call it my favorite but it ranks up there .
did you ever take history 231 ?
he 's a terrible instructor and demands a lot but fortunately he 's an easy grader .
yes . definitely stay in the class . you will get a better grade than your test scores . he does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot .
why ? what 's stressing you out ?
what do you mean by that ?
you 've been always active and versatile . it seems that you are interested in everything .
oh you ca n't think like that . we young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . you like taking photos and going to photography shows why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
she was great . in today s class she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . she told us not to arm for exams and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .
that would have to be miss baymler my fourth grade teacher .
she had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . for example the students had to treat each other with respect or they would be disciplined .
i see . she sounds like she really cared about her students .
well . to be honest i usually sucked up to teachers because i wanted them to give me good grades . however miss baymler didn t treat me any differently . she really didn t have any teacher s pets .
you ca n't help learning when you 're using it all day . you 'll see . a few weeks 'study in the school will have a similar effect on you .

oh you mean pavarotti domingo and carreras . have you been to their live shows ?
yeah it 's really a unique experience . it 's a solo concert by pavarotti . he put on the performance in the forbidden city in beijing .
i 've heard of that one . it was also his swan song .
yes i went to the new year 's concert in 2005 .
lorin maazel . he did an amazing job . moreover he just celebrated his 75th birthday .
the right opportunity for you would come along soon . you know music is transnational .
what about the yellowstone national park ?
yes . the wellknown yellowstone waterfall is formed when the yellowstone lake falls down into the yellowstone canyon .
why not ? let me recommend a website .
certainly . realplayer is a good .
do you have any particular hobbies tom ?
i 'm no better than them . they say it 's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time but i think it 's stimulating .
it was held in 776 b . c . at olympia . it also has a long history of more than 2700 years .
yes there were no games in 1916 1940 and 1944 because of world war i and world war ii .
i see . look do you know what that emblem means ? i 've seen it so many times but i do n't know what it stands for .
oh it 's the beijing 2008 olympics emblem . it 's a chinese seal meaning that chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world .
he 's 78 and he 's a new emigrant from south america and he 's never been to school .
what 's the matter ?
every time i try to start this program the computer freezes .
for instance the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
well direct ones are the pollution directly from factories refineries waste treatment plants etc . aren t they ?
indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
so what happened ?
network is omnipresent nowadays . it 's quite convenient for people . you see we can download music and information from the internet i can study from it too . and the most of all we can compose send and receive emails .
yeah you are right . internet makes our lives easier . but it 's a twoblade sword .
i mean internet brings benefit a lot but also some disadvantages . for example many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study or some bad guys steal people 's money online etc .
sounds interesting i have n't gone boating for some time now and what time ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
see you then .
but i found you always hate to part with your money . look at the car you drive it 's such a junker !
oh the car is old but still in good condition . i just think we should be thrifty whether you are rich or not .
hi how are you doing ?
you 're kidding . the storyline and acting were outstanding .
i know it but i do n't know when i can make it better .
hello !
is that the boxoffice ?
yes .
i 'd like to book two tickets for the film jane eyre for this evening please .
just a minute please . oh i 'm sorry all the tickets for tonight have been sold out .
ok your name and telephone number please .
wang min . telephone number is 13811658 . can i pick the tickets this afternoon ?
yes of course .
oh gush ! the first day of my career is over . i can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . but i heard the notice that our company will hold twoweek staff training .
stop fussing ! it is said that the training is important for our newcomers . and my company also informs me to attend the training next week .
but the ref did n't whistle .
my wife did n't like to go to amusement parks so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . i think vacation in summer is not good .
well when summer comes the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . no one would like to stay in the open air for long .
i myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects especially the singing of cicadas .
well it 's hard to say . for the fields and rivers winter is a relaxing season but for farmers i think they might take a rest physically but mentally they are still busy thinking planning and calculating for the working of the next year .
yes ! we have all assumed that you were the quiet shy type .
yeah what 's up ?
did n't they say we 're going to the ritz ?
yes but not the ritz carlton the ritz is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor .
ta da ! let 's go to the ritz !
hey sarah . why are you limping ?
i remember the first time i went . my back was sore i could n't sit down because it hurt my butt and my legs would cramp if i walked too fast .
ha . there wo n't be a next time .
so then what happened ?
well when he sobered up he called someone from work to come and bail him out .
well you know claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something .
oh man i hate rejection . it really makes you feel terrible especially when you really liked the person .
yes and the driver did n't speak any english or chinese and he did n't have a phone on himcan you believe it ? and his radio did n't work . so there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .
well i actually thumbed a lift .
well you 'll see .
ok an englishman a scotsman and an irishman were going on a trip across the desert and they could only take one thing with them .
i see .
oh sorry .
well as i was saying they showed each other what they had decided to bring . the englishman had brought some water . if we get thirsty we 'll have something to drink he said . the scotsman brought a map . if we get lost we 'll be able to find our way . the irishman had brought a car door .
the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked but the redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
i guess he hit him too hard the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
yeah .
that 's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
mike 's going to have a selfdriving traveling across the country .
i was n't quite prepared for the view of the earth as we left . it was just aweinspiring . it emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole earth where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . i was n't quite prepared for that . it 's inevitably etched in my memory .
when viewing the earth from space do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?
detached . you 're literally detached from one planet captured by another . your only link to reality is the earth out there fortunate 1y it stays in view the whole time .
there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission . it seemed to fizzle out . do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public 's passion for space and get us to mars sooner ?
i hope this flight is not just a onetime affair that it does reignite people 's interest to push on . but only time will tell .
you had gone to the moon twice orbited space around the earth lots of times and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? i just ca n't wait .
either they go to a public place such as a hotel a restaurant or a club or to the home of the brid
the chinese custom is to go to the groom 's homejust the opposite .
many american furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding .
tell me something about the bridal bouquet . is n't it the custom to throw it ?
absolutely ! it says there is water on mars buried beneath the surface . it 's just a matter of how deep it is .
then could the soil on mars somehow be fertile enough to groh simple plants ?
the soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . and it would need to be protected from the uv radiation .
actually we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on mars for an extended period of time . does nasa have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?
i 'm not sure nasa has built any portable habitats for extended stays on mars but they have looked at various designs .
but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .
i 'm skeptical . mars is made of rocks containing silicon iron and various minerals . it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . it is so different from what we have on earth you know .
i 'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there .
i am sorry sir . all the tickets have been sold out .
oh ralph i heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . disasters have happened before . if the spaceship were out of order . . .
you should be optimistic about this . things have taken a good turn . you should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible .
but is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ?
are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?
no the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . but not too much . as the space between galaxies expands it carries the galaxies further apart like raisins in an expanding dough .
but i heard that our milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . if galaxies are moving apart from each other how can they collide ?
well the universe is a chaotic place and the gravity from one galaxy or from a group of galaxies may disturb the motion of its near neighbors causing them to collide . however on average when you compare two large enough chunks of space the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other .
no i do n't .
that sounds like a good idea .
recently there prevails net love !
maybe yesterday you 've received a man's woos . he 's called beast ?
it 's typical net love and a typical lesbians homosex ! ha !
almost . there are a lot of polar animals sea birds such as seals whales and penguins people do n't get much chance of seeing them .
normally at six . before that they spend several years in the kindergarten or preschool education center .
but thats only in the cities isnt it ?
jim and you are bosom friends are n't you ?
i know that they are auspicious fish . it 's quite popular nowadays .
not at all . i think the tattoos are so cool and chic .
john do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?
yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all .
if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes .
yes . the german engineer would never dreamed that the hand supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the occident within a few years and even spread to japan and china .
looking at the five sense organs of a scooter it can be said as delicate and agile . to pull the tshaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
small and exquisite in size easy to operate foldable and easy to carry are its charms .
no problem .
it seems that you are an optimistic man who does n't dismay easily . that is what a good salesman needs . good luck .
thank you .
yes but if you choose some good b2b websites such problems can be avoided .
will you give some suggestion ?
of course such as the alabama which is a famous website .
you hit the white ball with your cue . the white ball hits the colored balls . and you want to get the colored balls into the pockets .
certainly . what 's the matter ?
great ! it 's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
that 's simple . just click the hyperlink www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must 've finished remodeling . why do you want to know ?
i 'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must 've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed .
how should i do ?
we have been on good terms . she is a very nice girl . but she got in dutch with her boss . i don t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements .
tea does good to people 's health . there are many kinds of tea . say black tea green tea scented tea brick tea milk tea jas mine tea chrysanthemum tea and so on .
my favourite is jasmine tea . i like its aroma .
the aquamedic pool is included . you can choose three .
we 'll do the seaweed wrap the jet bath and the foot massage .
but the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .
hey joshua ! is anny coming with us ?
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? aha someone has a crush on anny does n't he ?
that 's good to know . oh listen ! the band 's playing our song .
what about going to the zoo on saturday and to the park on sunday ?
from the crown's . oh what lovely earrings you have ! are they diamond ?
he 'll come out with surprises . just wait and see . look at that woman with the white chiffon !
she 's chic is n't she ?
yes . i like the dress . it must be the latest fashion . look the hem has lowered and the waist narrowed .
it makes me feel rather shabby . that woman has a good taste in dressing i would say .
yes . she dressed with an individual flair . i rather envy her .
most women follow fashion like sheep . they do n't know any better than imitate .
i quite agree with you . see the woman there ? i dare say she has n't got any eyes . how could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? and all that jewelry !
so what ? it only makes her look cheap and vulgar .
you know those upstarts . they 're all showoffs ! i think i 'd better have a diet otherwise i 'd look like a ballon soon .
you 're quite slim . in fact if you were one of those starlets the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .
what 's up ?
yes .
is it stimulating ?
perfect and i like her charming eyes too .
oh yeah . the total amount is no less than 13000 rib according to our itinerary .
hmm what i 'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel .
well start out from long island this friday . we 've planned a four day drive to salt lake city where we 'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .
yes we 'll take our time . and we 'll go to fivelake strict and the wall street .
yes .
what 's the weather like in your country ?
in london . where do you live ?
me too . recently i 'm fascinated with netchat . i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them . i really enjoy it .
yes i should get there just in time for the women s 400m relay .
every time when heroes came back from the battlefield we took our hats off to them .
you were showing respect and admiration for them .
i agree . they 're very lovely especially huanhuan
cindy how come nearly all the primetime tv shows are comedies ?
that 's because americans love sitcoms .
sitcoms ?
situation comedies . a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . if there is one thing that all the shows have in common it is teaching wholesome values .
in taiwan primetime shows are an hour long and most of them are n't comedies .
no i haven t . i haven t visited the bund either . i ve always had too much work to do .
it was ! but the worst thing was i tore my best shirt .
what ? it s only 9p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
i 'm tired of your cutanddried opinions . who do you think you are !
do n't cover up your sadness . let it go .
you know that ? dan got a divorce .
yeah . but his relation with sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
oh thank you so much .
it was so kind of you .
are you doing anything tonight ?
hi how are you doing ?
no i have n't had a chance to . but i have been watching a chinese tv scries called chinesestyle divorce .
oh . really ? i saw it two years ago . it 's worth seeing and it 's thoughtprovoking .
it reflects some of our difficulties in this everchanging world .
oh that 's too shortlived .
that 's true . it 's said the shortlived marriage is typical of the post 80s generation .
ii ca n't agree more . the onlychildgeneration in china tends to know little about marriage .
you were scared too ? i dared not tell you my feeling when i heard that . i almost got fainted .
hi kenji .
oh hi justin . this is karen hepburn . we met at chris and jim 's party .
great . uh justin would you like to see otis lesley on thursday night ? he 's at the kangaroo club .
my mother likes to split hairs .
what do you mean by that ?
you don t know that i have been overprotected by my mother these years . i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings .
they ca n't spell they ca n't add they ca n't subtract they even do n't remember any more . that s because they rely on gadgets .
let 's enter it !
what would you like to drink ?
tomorrow ? no i am afraid i won t be able to . i m going on business to birmingham .
no that s not true . i ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
i must confess i have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .
i really want to pick your brain about something i 've been thinking a lot about .
i know education is expensive but it 's been my lifelong dream . call me crazy but i 've always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name .
i think you need to separate the dream of having a phd from the reality of years of more schooling . it 's not as romantic as you might think .
yeah . . . i keep thinking about what i 'll do with a master 's or doctorate . i love language but i do n't think there are a lot of wellpaying jobs out there for experts on shakespeare .
well stress is a real thing . it 's not an imaginary condition .
it 's seriously affecting my life ! i ca n't sleep i do n't have much of an appetite and my husband says i 've been kind of short tempered . other people seem to handle stress okay . . . why am i so weak ?
you 're not weak . . . you 're stressed out ! stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators . . . and as you might imagine that was pretty stressful .
yeah but i do n't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . my stress is just about silly paperwork !
but you 're actually having the same reaction as our treedwelling ancestors ! it 's called the flight or fight response . each time you feel like something 's threatening you your body decides whether to run away or fight . . . it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .
so a deadline will cause that same reaction ?
you can call a mover .
but think about it you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers how much trouble you will save .
i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . i ll leave you their phone number .
it s 8357688 8 .
it 's a scam 7 that 's based on a hierarchy like a pyramid . the person at the top asks the people below him for money and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .
not exactly . the scam keeps on going with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .
nothing . the people at the bottom give their money to the people above them and they get nothing . they end up losing . that 's why it 's a scam .
well every department is different . you would n't want your new coworkers to think you 're a grinch right ?
a grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . you know a party proper .
but actually it s not done yet . i m going to get a special pendent lamp .
that s all right . let me see oh that lace looks so unique and it s so creative to make a picture display here . how did you get that idea ?
no it has three bedrooms and three beds and has a living room with a twelvefoot ceiling . there s a twocar garage .
yeas when will you buy a house ?
really ? that 's a straws in the wind .
at least it is better than my boxed lunch at work . i 'm so fed up with the bland food . thank you for having lunch with me !
good afternoon madam . how can i help you ?
do you have any hobbies ?
how is aunty shirley ?
hey daniel what 's your favorite weather ? snowy or sunny ?
ew danny gross !
i love snowy because it is very very romantic .
yes the weather sure is nice today .
i do n't think so . i say the weather report last night and it said the weather should be fine all day .
studying in the university is not easy but it 's not as arduous as you think .
yeah . people always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances .
really ? then i 'm really lucky . oh it 's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .
let me see . teetee training school summer program 3000 yuan learn how to drive within one month and get driver 's license within three months .
i think so . let 's see the next one 3500 yuan summer program . forget it .
that 's right .
daniel have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ?
yes of course .
yes .
i 've heard the hitchhiker would be on next week . i want to see it .
how time flies !
really ? it was on in 1994 for the first time . and it is really a classic .
yeah i am very impressed with tom hanks performance in the movie .
life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you 're gonna get .
you know it also won 6 oscar awards in 1995 . unbelievable !
wow it stars catherine zetajones my favorite actress .
well birds of a feather flock together . i like her too . she was in a lot of dramas .
what 's more she does n't have scandals . and she likes to take part in the charitable activities .
steven spielberg . another superstar .
yes a legend also . i still remember his movies jurassic park and schindler 's list got him nine oscar awards in 1994 .
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous i d do interviews for all the top magazines like cosmo and elle .
that s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
you d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity so you d really need to be very careful . anyway i d be the first to buy your posters and i d attend your first booksinging when you wrote your autobiography .
yes i do . i also use an antispyware program and a firewall . there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very careful and keep you computer clean .
i use it for several thingssurfing the net word processing and creating presentations . i don t play many games on my computer but i do a lot of work with photographs . using c computer program you can edit and resize photographs . you can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones .
so if the cause is poverty there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources share them .
not at all . i m an agnostic . do you ?
i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
i basically believe in science over theology . i mean i believe in evolution for example . however there are many things that science hasn t explained yet .
i m sure that science will explain everything eventually . i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
religions preach tolerance but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
i didn t realize it was a romance novel . what s the main storyline ?
how about this . when you finish the book . i ll get the movie and watch it with you .
why do you like it best ?
if i have a chance i 'll enjoy the book .
but i . . . i do n't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids 'ability to thinkbecause kids do n't learn basic skills .
they ca n't spell they ca n't add they ca n't subtract they even do n't remember any more . that 's because they rely on gadgets .
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
yes .
and a white sports car .
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
what are you doing ?
the world cup ! the first match is today ! it s mexico vs . south africa ! it s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country and all .
this is bigger than the super bowl man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups each group having 4 teams . the top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals .
that s both fortunate and unfortunate . it s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian a chilean a new zealander though he prefers to call himself a kiwi . who else do we have ? oh we also have a moroccan a togolese a pakistani and two indonesians !
that s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia except me . there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and one russian .
and stay in the shallow area . i don t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it s too deep out there and we didn t bring your floatier .
trina will you marry me ?
oh babe i can t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! i can t wait for all the adventures we re going to have for all the fights and the laughter . i can t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .
no need to sweat it . my parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding which is going to be lowbudget anyway . so roughly four hundred people which means that the hall at northwoods heights will be our reception venue . i thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents church and my uncle of course would be officiating . we ll meet with him soon for some prewedding counseling . the music for the wedding ceremony was a nobrainer . my stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that . my cousin will be the official photographer . i thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . did you know that she s going to be a professional opera singer ?
and then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ll get the youth group to serve us . i was thinking that your friend s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . or we could hire a dj . your sister s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what s their name again ? i was thinking that we could have an island paradisethemed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like aquamarine . and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ll make our toasts ! what do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? who else am i missing ? oh your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !
joanne let s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is okay ? let s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly so we can go our separate ways alright ?
fine with me . i just want to get this over with . it s important we make a clean break . i should have signed a prenup .
nothing ! anyway you re right there s no reason this has to be nasty . my lawyer tells me you ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property as well as the custody agreementi keep the cat and you get the dog . so that s done . . . finally .
fine but i m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me .
whatever ! alright i ll concede the silly gramophone if you ll agree that i get the silver tea set .
oh joanne are we making a big mistake ? i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can t reconcile and try again ? i still love you .
i m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . i ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally . and you know i can be charming in interviews . goodbye my penniless days ! hello salary and a career !
that s where you re making a big mistake ! you can t just guess peoples likes or sizes ! especially with clothes or jewelry . on top of that i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !
yeah you re right . when it comes down to it i can be pretty tacky .
yeah tell me about it . i know ! your mom is trying to learn spanish right ? why don t you get her a gift certificate for this great website i saw called spanishpod .
sportshoes . will you go with me ?
it depends on the weather .
then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ?
let 's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at mall cinema . betsy told me it 's a beautiful love story and i should n't miss it .
right it was a chick flick just like this one so what 's the difference ? besides this is the last week for the third movie in destroyer series and i want to see that on a big screen . action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen .
that place does n't have a single meat dish . just fish and shellfish and you know i do n't like fish that much .
tom hanks is always my favorite film star .
yeah i 've been out of town .
oh it 's getting late . i 've got to run . it was nice talking to you karren .
what 's that ?
that s true . but we have known each other over the internet for a few months now . actually we are on an intimate level . we even plan to be engaged next month .
i didn t but i applied for an apprenticeship and since i studied math and i have a good attitude my application was accepted .
what ? what is it ? what 's the matter ?
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you 're told .
so jack do you believe in ghosts ?
oh do you know why ? actually it s easy . because i always exercise . my exercise i think is very hard . i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . i feel alive !
oh i know . i saw you doing pullups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you .
well do what you like to do . it can be anything . jogging doing aerobics going bicycling and playing pingpong . absolutely anything . doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . but remember to do some stretches first .
ok wait a minute . . . let 's see . i 'm a taurus and it says mars is in the third house and is soon to eclipse venus . i do n't know what that means but then it says your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me .
what about gemini ? what 's the prediction ?
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today and you will lose that which you value . be careful .
no i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . haven t you noticed that ?
do n't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ?
yes at first i felt very awkward . after bill was demoted and then resigned it was kind of like somebody died ! i mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . and then i was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to . . .
did they mutiny ?
i heard through the grapevine that michael probably become the new sales manager .
i am not a rumor monger .
how about this one ?
it 's okay .
yes unbelievably cheap . carlsborg is less than 1 .
come on you do n't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity .
it 's a long time ago . when i first went to a bar to pick up girls there i saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . then i went up to her and said can i buy you a drink ?
if i can improve my vertical jump a few more inches i think beach volleyball might be my ticket .
to be honest i do n't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch !
you 've heard of bruce jenner have n't you ?
he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics right ?
how about transom ?
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad full of smoke and the music is too loud so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
you are really career minded .
yeah .
how many in your party ?
er . . . hum . . . got it .
oh it 's getting late . i 've got to run . it was nice talking to you karren .
tom . . . you are her boss you kown . of course she 's helpful to you .
well i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
hello !
pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ?
it 's easy to get loose bowels in summer .
it took quite a while but the worst part was getting numbed . they had to give me 3 shoots .
no kidding . not only can t i stand the pain but man . . . dentists are expensive . the bill is going to be humungous !
of course not .
i just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . you can still fill me in on tile details .
well anyway i made a beeline over to their office had an interview with the manager and was told to start work the next day .
don t tell me your re already bucking for a promotion .
well speak of the devil .
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
well i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
hey look outside ! it 's started to drizzle !
what are you doing ?
sure thing . what are your plans for the evening ?
likewise . see you later .
the movie starts at eight o clock so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv where you pay a fixed amount each mo
i have had disagreement with every director . i ve worked with . we ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don t no
i wanted to but my insurance company wouldn t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know i used to do my own stunts but i ll leave that to the experts in future .
like what ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
actually some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
how are you doing ?
unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .
i could n't even stand on it and hold the sail . i probably fell down fifty times .
yes it was really stupid .
this place serves good breakfasts do n't you think ?
i saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . i want to rent one .
do n't waste your money . windsurfing is very hard . and it will be windy today . they will charge you fifty dollars for a halfhour and you wo n't be able to windsurf . you will fall and fall and fall .
yes but it takes a long time to learn . you would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer .
i do n't want people to think i 'm stingy .
alright . buy it then . i wo n't buy anything . well maybe i 'll buy some cognac .
maybe i could buy some cognac for my brother . he always drinks it .
why not fifty or onehundred dollars ?
okay . onehundred then . do you think i will lose it ?
blackjack . we can play blackjack . and i will gamble onehundred or maybe twohundred dollars .
that 's nice . what do they have you doing over there ?
true take my former supervisor as an example . he was extremely controlling and overbearing . he always had to micromanage everything .
hi natasha how 's life ?
i thought you were the only child in the family . did n't china practice the onlychild policy in the early 1980s ?
oh that 's janice . she 's just new in town . you have a thing for blonds eh ?
i can see five other guys eying her up .
i never chatted online before . what 's it like .
to people all over the world ! i have a lot of net pals . see the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . you can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were
well my suggestion for a newbie like you is that do n't get lost in the cyberspace . you know internet wo n't do the filtration for you so you still need to use your judgement . there are a lot of per
org ! it must be so late where you are . what time is it ?
really impressive . these two genres are totally different .
that is to say you like all genres except for horror movies .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or wouldbe friends is a way of solidifying friendship especially in northern china .
i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another i 'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick .
you lose face by refusing to drink and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort no one will jeer at you .
in college . but i do n't dance very often . what 's your favourite dance ?
what a nuisance ! every time i plan to go canoeing or camping a storm comes along . the sky gets dark the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops . well i 'd better stay home .
i once went to singapore by air . it was very excitingbut never again .
he put it out and flew back to the airport . then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was .
someone called drexler . carl drexler . he 's been with the company onlytwo years . i 've been here longer . and i know more about the job too
you mean you think i did n't get the job because i come to work in jeansand a sweater ?
i had broken up with him how painful i feel . i m going to drown my sorrows .
why is that ?
i m betting the new york yankees win . how about you ?
well i m favor of the red sox . they ve had a good season .
sorry guys . could i just interrupt for a moment ? my money is on the yankees !
that s not a very good pick . i m against the yankees .
hey ken . good luck if you already put your money on the red sox .
like what ?
yes . you should take your glass paper plastic cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center .
no i can t let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ?
what was the biggest turing point in your life ?
i usee i would say that would be moving out of my parents house for the first time .
really ? why is that ?
have you remarried since then ?
how long have you been married ?
we used to be really close but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you did n't mention to your biological father .
no . i have n't had a chance to read the paper yet .
you know iden i don t know much about you . where were you born ?
i had a pretty strict upbring and my parents and i were always fighting about it .
oh sure . once they reached middle age they became a lot less uptight .
my husband and i have thought about it but we 've decided not to have any . they 're just too expensive . besides with all the news about global warming on the news lately who knows what kind of worl
for me growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i would n't ever have to share .
yes there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out have fun and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discour
i don t like to make friends with people who aren t honest . honesty is very important to me .
he seemed ok . we didn t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .
amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party she was being ver serious .
what s wrong with is ?
not really . i know that it happens but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities i don t think it s the best way to sho

how many workers are there on the lines ?
good morning miss cai . congratulations ! you ve passed the interview .
well betty . since you ve done well during the probation period we decided to employ you formally . and now we need to sign the formal agreement .
madam i made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . i think there are something needs to modify .
the second thing i would like to point out that is packaging . it 's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . but i think the wooden cases are much safer .
of course . a twoweek paid vacation a year a fiveday workweek .
no problem .
kenvir ? hi it 's alice . i 'm very sorry that i have a big favor to ask you again .
i really ca n't work overtime . because my husband has been ill recently i must take care of him .
have you checked the fuse box ?
yes the fuse had blown and i 've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out .
i think the gears have seized up
glad to . the fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with china .
i see . would you be interested in seeing the audiovisual products ? they are made by our company .
we are interested in some precision machine tools . we have some inquires on hand .
that 's fine . we can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry .
can i have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ?
do n't take it too hard . there are some tips you should know in jobhunting of 2010 .
firstly you must always show your best to the interviewer . and secondly try to avoid spamming through emails because this will make the reader go crazy . the last but not the least there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
as you know we are in a very special time . this is a very hard time for many countries economics both developed and developing . i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
he was very distinguished maybe a bit overqualified .
ohhhh . i hate this part of my job .
most people think that wealth means success . but from my point of view the problem should be viewed from two aspects . on the one hand wealth is a very important thing to measure success . the ability to make money to some extent signifies your knowledge your capability the value of your labor etc . . with the development of our economy and industry more and more people are pursuing money these days . and in toda s society if you have money you seem to have everything . but this is not the case . i think success on the other hand also means satisfaction from work . it also means that you can get respect from others .
he always says i am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility sufficient education and enough experience .
no . not at all . i 'm quite easygoing .
well there 's a lot of stress in a chinese company also although much of it is below the surface . i have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . if i have a problem with a coworker i do everything i can to work it out directly with that person . if i am unable to work it out then i ask a supervisor to help out . if my boss shouts at me i try not to take it personally . i try my best to understand the stress he is under . it 's kind of like being in a family . often family members say things in the heat of the moment but do n't mean what they say . a company is like a family it has good times and bad times .
do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?
under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?
ok no problem . we do it ourselves .
we have thought of you carefully with discretion but the other candidate has more experiences .
look the printer isn t functioning well . i ve pushed the start button . it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . what s going on ?
it is hard to tell . maybe it is because you 're not resourceful enough to be a manager .
hello is that miss lan ? this is nina with huawei corp .
yes speaking .
i 'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us .
today is september 28th 2007 .
it will begin at three o 'cock . what 's the time now ?
good morning . what time is it now ?
get the clients contact info from my rolodex .
certainly .
and make sure to return my rolodex to my desk when you are done with it .
susan can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in china ?
well as per capital income goes up and up the growth sector seems to be in the highend .
yes it 's not too bad . our sales are going up year after year . and we still have a large potential production capacity .
that 's a good idea . so far we have several agents abroad .
we are willing to be your agent in thailand for handheld tools . what do you think ?
that sounds good .
4 is too low i think . you see we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion such as advertising on radio or tv printing booklets leaflets catalogues and so on . it all costs money 4 is not enough .
you mean to saya

your lc must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment otherwise we wo n't be able to catch the ship .

do you work there ? i have an interview today with dale mendoza . do you know her ?

first you should have a salutation which can be the company 's or a person's name .

sit down please . maybe you have read the contract but i want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . you must have a threemonth internship .
how long will the induction training be ?
i see .
what kind of jobs have you had ?

my name is helen levin . i 'm the hr director of our company .
miss levin . nice to meet you .
both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does .
thank you .
thank you so much .
we have achieved great success last year . the most important is that we realize our strength lies in aftersale service .
i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . how about meeting each other halfway ?
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let 's meet each other halfaway again and split the difference i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
mr . smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle a5 fob qingdao ?
since this is a sizeable order i was thinking you might give us a 5 discount .
you 've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here .
yes . we are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . and the demand is getting greater and greater . by the way which items are you interested in ?
i 'm particularly interested in shortbreads . do you have some samples you could show me ?
yes . this way please . our shortbread is in a variety of flavors such as almond walnut lotus seed etc . and different packaging has different weights . we can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require .
how was your appraisal with the boss ?
i am thinking about resigning from my current job .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen pm . do you have a projector in your room ? i would like to show you some related charts
what is the problem ?
if we were in the same conference room i would not work late these days . that conference room has been booked out . this time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . so everything has to be rearranged and checked like tables chairs mean tacks podium audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu .
i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
you re welcome . you know these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
why do you want to be a stewardess ?
what is the salary while on probation ?
bill ! sure come on in . what can i do for you ?
well sir as you know i have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
yes .
i understand your position and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales but you must also take into consideration my hard work proactiveness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
i m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
how could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ?
we could contact alumni who work for large wellknow companies . they might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets .
