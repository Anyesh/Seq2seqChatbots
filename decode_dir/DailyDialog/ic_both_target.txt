 because i don  t think my husband would like it  .  thank you for inviting me anyway  .  
 don  t mention it  .  
 everything 's great  .  and you  ?  
 speaking  .  
 oh  hi justin  .  this is karen hepburn . we met at chris and jim 's party  .  
 what do you mean by that  ?  
 she has keen to buy something which is much cheaper  .  
 maybe you are right  .  
 why  ?  
 we are going to buy our own house  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 they ca n't spell  they ca n't add  they ca n't subtract  they even do n't remember any more . that s because they rely on gadgets  .  
 is she really  ?  
 ok  .  
 do you promise  ?  
 of course  .  
 and tom  you will help johnny with his homework  wo n't you  ?  
 me too  .  
 i will  .  
 and don  t ever forget it  .  
 how do you do  ?  
 please sit down  .  help yourself just like you are at home  .  
 what would you like to drink  ?  
 a cup of coffee  please  .  
 bye  .  
 i 'm a teacher  .  
 good  .  
 would you like to come  ?  
 what kind of job are you looking for  ?  
 either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel  .  
 that  s right  .  
 i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service  .  i  ll leave you their phone number  .  
 wonderful  .  
 you  re welcome  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i mean that you 're gullible  .  you should n't believe everything you read  especially on the internet  .  
 what happened  ?  
 well  three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person  .  
 what is that  ?  
 a grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic  .  you know  a party proper  .  
 thank you  .  
 do you really think so  ?  
 yeah  you have some other ideas  ?  
 for example  ?  
 we did n't pay attention to the environment  cut down trees and polluted the air  .  
 what else  ?  
 since everyone is different  your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal  .  
 yes  i like collecting things  .  
 that 's right  .  
 i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship  .  
 yes  of course  .  
 so tell me about it  !  
 why not  ?  
 because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus  .  you can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be  .  
 yes  .  
 i prefer to go there next time  .  
 i don  t think that there is any easy way  .  the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country  .  at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate  .  the thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 well  i hate the noise in the city  but i love being around lost of people  .  the problem is that you can  t have lots of people and have peace and quiet  .  the two just don  t go together  .  
 for example  ?  
 religions preach tolerance  but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics  .  
 exactly  .  
 is it very interesting  ?  
 yes  ?  
 the man asked where we want to go  then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply  .  a few moment later  he gave us two tickets  .  
 that 's right  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 they ca n't spell  they ca n't add  they ca n't subtract  they even do n't remember any more  .  that 's because they rely on gadgets  .  
 yes  .  
 and a white sports car  .  
 what makes you say that  ?  
 today  i 'm told i failed three courses  .  
 i hope so  .  
 why not  ?  
 because i don  t think my husband would like it  .  thank you for inviting me anyway  .  
 ok  !  
 let  s see  .  he has a roman nose  bushy eyebrows and dimples  !  
 what am i doing  ?  what am i doing  ?  don  t you know what day it is  ?  
 what  ?  
 the world cup  !  the first match is today  !  it  s mexico vs  .  south africa  !  it  s going to be a really good match  !  both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players  .  i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country  and all  .  
 what was that  ?  
 nothing  !  anyway  you  re right  there  s no reason this has to be nasty  .  my lawyer tells me you  ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property  as well as the custody agreementi keep the cat and you get the dog  .  so that  s done  .  .  .  finally  .  
 what happened  ?  
 i  m in the market for a job  !  i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for  .  i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write  .  i  ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally  .  and you know i can be charming in interviews  .  goodbye my penniless days  !  hello salary and a career  !  
 coffee  please  .  
 what about you  mary  ?  
 why  ?  
 because orange is much more to my taste  .  
 i 'm not sure  .  
 what about going to a movie  ?  
 ok  .  
 i think so  too  .  
 you too  .  
 so what  ?  
 you know how much i want to be on the team  and now there is an opening for me . if i do n't go to practise today . they ll get someone else and i 'll miss my chance  .  
 when  ?  
 after baseball practice  .  
 what 's that  ?  
 could i get back the sweater you borrowed  ?  
 wow  !  
 do you like sports  janice  ?  
 so what did you do  ?  
 i hid so that it could n't see me  .  slowly it got closer and closer  until  .  .  .  
 he is a nice guy and very considerate  .  i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor  .  
 how about this one  ?  
 it  s really elegant and it fits you really well  .  
 and then  ?  
 then i talked to her and got her number  .  you know what  ?  when you do n't know what to say  ?  just drink  .  
 i like spring best  .  it is neither too cold nor too hot  .  freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier  .  how about you  ?  
 yeah  .  
 who won  ?  
 wonderful  .  
 where do we pay the fare  ?  
 just give the man standing there three yuan and he 'll give you a token  .  then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in  .  
 i  m afraid this seat is taken  .  
 thank you  .  
 you too  .  
 go right ahead  .  
 well  i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room  and maybe some new drapes for the windows  .  also  a grandfather clock would look great in the den  .  perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 oh  hi  !  
 good idea  .  
 of course not  .  
 i  m jack  .  what  s your name  ?  
 good idea  .  
 since we  re good friends  you do n't have to pay me  .  
 why  ?  
 i did experience a winter with snow in kunming  the spring city  .  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i was just thinking about you the other day  .  
 that sounds like fun  .  
 hey  look outside  !  it 's started to drizzle  !  
 what are you doing  ?  
 i 'm going to my parents house for my father 's birthday  .  
 bye  !  
 like what  ?  
 well  we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start  .  
 where are you from  ?  
 i 'm from the plains of the midwest  .  it 's a prime location for tornadoes  .  
 i 'm ok  .  i wish i could say the same for my friend  .  
 why not  ?  
 okay  .  
 so how much do you want to gamble  ?  
 how much are they  ?  
 this one is 2300 dollars . maybe i should buy it for my mother  .  what do you think  ?  
 thank you  .

 good luck  !

 yes  i did  .  
 i 'm sorry  .  that 's too bad  .  who is it  ?  who got the job  i mean  ?  
 why is that  ?  
 i do n't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world  .  the world is just far too big for that  .  
 like what  ?  
 well  we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start  .  
 i  m a firefighter  .

 what  ?  
 i went down to change some money  right  ?  
 what do you mean  ?  
 i went into the bank with my money  and i looked at the exchange board . at first i could n't believe it  .  i thought i was reading the board wrong or something  .  
 why  ?  
 because the board said 60 pesos for every taiwan dollar  .  
 that  s right  .
