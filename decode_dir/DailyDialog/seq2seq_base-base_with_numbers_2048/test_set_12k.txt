that 's good .
i could n't do that .
no the first time we have to be in a different country .

what 's that ?
i 'm going to the store to get some .
yes that 's right . you know it 's a hard one .
hi i m just looking for a new apartment .
what about ?
that s my way to work . i think it would be a good idea for you to get a job in a lot of money .
that 's what you 're talking about .
yes . i think it 's a little too expensive for me .
do you think it 's a good idea ?
well first of all i can go to the beach with a friend and i 'll go to the supermarket .
well you can get the right amount for you . you should buy some new clothes for the whole year .
i see .
no i m not sure . i ve got a small bag .
you are not sure ? you 're right . we should be able to find something like that .
no i 'm not going to be able to find that .
then what 's the problem ?
well i guess i just started from the office . i was hoping to be a bit nervous .
not at all !
not yet . i was thinking about getting a little tired .
on a second ?
no it s a <unk> .
well you can tell me what you want to know .
i m looking forward to this .
all right .
here s an interesting plan .
here you are .
the rent is 150 per month .
when is the fare ?
it s on the fifth floor .
oh you re kidding !
of course i did . i guess i could never afford to buy a new one .
i don t think it s a good idea . i d like to get a new one .
why ?
yeah . but what about the <unk> ? i 've never seen a lot of things before .
of course .
i want to check out the bank .
ok . please fill out the form and i 'll check your passport .
i am going to the apartment on the internet .
well in that case i 'll take it .
that 's right . thank you very much .
it 's about a long time . it 's about 40 .
ok . i 'll take it .
the next one .
it is a <unk> .
do you know that ?
we re going to have to get a car on the bus .
well our price is very large .
what 's the price that is at the price ?
you can have a lot of money .
you can get a bonus at the end of this month for the next year .
how long does it take to get there ?
but i 'm afraid i have to get a prescription .
how about a new apartment ?
i 'm just trying to find out .
well we 've got to get a new one .
no . what 's the difference ?
the only thing you need to do is to get a new car .
no i am not sure . i am a bit of a hurry .
if i could come back tomorrow i 'll come back to the office tomorrow morning and i 'll be able to make it for a new one .
i guess not . it 's a good thing i 'm afraid .
so what 's the matter ?
i 've been looking forward to it for a long time . how long have you been working with it ?
oh i see .
well i can tell you what you 're going to do about it .
what kind of food do you like ?
yes i have a look .
have you got a new one ?
you are right . that s a good idea . you can get a good job in the city .
that s a good idea . i ll take it .
certainly . the fitting room is in the right .
how much is the fare ?
about a week .
do you like it ?
sure .
yes i 'm going to buy a new house .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .
i 'm very good at the moment .

i want to know if there is any problem .
that 's fine .
ok .
no thanks . i 'm going to be there .
ok i will be there in time .
are you sure ?
no problem . but there are some other things you need to get .
i think that the price is a little more expensive .
that s a good idea . it s very kind of you to say so .
the problem is that the most important thing is that you can do a little more about your work .
how about the one that you have ?
the most important thing is that we will be able to take your money back .
would you like to go to the station with me ?
how long will it take to get to the office ?
i 'm going to be able to help .
i have no idea .
that was n't a problem . it was a bit of a problem .
i think this is a good way for you to buy a new one .
i think it 's a good idea . the only thing we can do is to find a place to go on the way .
yes it is . i like the color .
i don t know .
what is it ?
well they just want to know how to play the piano .
i would like to take it off if i could n't afford to pay for the rent .
is that all ?
i think so .
well i have a lot of work in this magazine .
what did you do ?
not at all !
i 'm fine . thanks for coming .

what is it ?
i need a few minutes to check my card .

what time would you like to pay in ?
it s not a problem . you can get a discount for you .
that s fine .
ok mr . smith . you need to fill in this form and i 'll be back in a minute .
i think i could do that . it was too good for me .
i ve been looking for a lot of paper but i m not sure if it s a good idea .
well the price is more than ten percent of the service .
i m going to be the same thing !
the only thing that you need to be done but the only thing is to be successful .
can i see your computer conditions on the internet too ?
yes if you do n't need to pay any attention to the contract .
that 's a good idea . we could n't find a place to go with the price .
i had to get a few things off the internet so i m not sure if it would be better .

that 's a lot of interesting .
it was in the middle of this city .

well there were some problems that we had to go out for a few days but we should n't get it .
and the water ?

you should be able to do that .

a language language is better than a language .
true but english is more expensive than most .
a crazy language ? why do you say that ?
one thing can i have a lot of experience in this company .
no wonder you say english is a very good player .
it pretty well . i ve been feeling pretty well lately .
yeah i was thinking of getting a little earlier .
i was a bachelor 's degree in economics .
do you have any other questions ?
to be honest i like to be honest but i 'm not very familiar with the language .
i think so . i like the most of the fact that i 'm a bit nervous . i think it 's a bit of fun .
it was a great time .
maybe i can get the job right away .
she is in the hospital for a while .
oh i see .
i think i 'll get it right away .
i have a lot of friends . i would like to see you .
i think so .

is this the right one ?
i 'm glad you like it .
no . she did n't want to be so late .
well she must be able to tell her that she 's going to be like you 've got a lot of fun .
i was thinking of a child or something .

well yeah . . .
i was a runnera longdistance runner .
i know . i could n't believe it .
well i do n't know . but i think we should do something about it .
i am sorry but i ca n't agree more .

oh really ? how long have you been ?
that 's true . i did n't know that . but i 'm sure it would be a good idea .
do n't worry . i can get to the doctor if you like .

it 's a little bit too far . i think it 's a little expensive .
i am so sorry to hear that . i can t believe it !
i 'm going to the hospital .
do you want to take a look at your house ?
i think that it is too expensive to do that .
yes it 's good to hear .

no problem .
i 've got the idea of that .

i 've been really busy .
oh i see . do you like to play games on the other day ?
oh i 'm not sure . i do n't know how to use it .

he can also speak english well .
sounds good .
it was my pleasure .
so you 're right . it 's a very good game .
the time of course !
i 'm not sure .
what do you think is the most important thing for me to be happy ?
it seems that the most important thing is to take care of the job .
is i ? i can t afford to get any more expensive .
for the job you should have to pay attention to the internet .
that 's true . some people know what kind of people do .
yes it 's the right to take care of .
what 's the problem ?
i do n't know . but i think i should have a good idea .
yeah they 're really happy you know .
you 're right . i really do n't know what to do .
oh that 's all right . i 'm going to get a new car .
well how much do i owe you ?
no problem .
yeah . . . there are so many places that are not in the city .
but what are the prizes ?
they are very strict with people .
oh i see . i think they are very good .
yeah . they re so right . they are very good to know them .
but what about the price ?
it s only about 5 percent .
i see . for the minimum amount you can use the money for their savings account .
sure . it 's a pleasure .
you 'd better get a raise .
i 'm not going to do that .
well i think you should get a good rest .
nothing really .
is it that you really want to do ?
well i just got back from my college .
how do you know about the environment ?
that 's all right . it 's about the first year of our company . they have an excellent company .
if i can do that for you .
i do n't know what 's the matter .
that 's true . there are many ways of fashion .
what 's the matter ?
well i mean . . .
i think that 's a good idea . i think i can find a job that is more interesting than the environment .
that 's right . you should have more information about the environment .
oh i 'm afraid not . i 've never seen a movie . what 's the problem ?
it 's about time for a walk .
fine i 'll be expecting you .
how about the afternoon ?
oh that 's really nice of you .
i 'm glad you 're going to have to stay for a few days .

i 've never started it . but i am not sure if i get a car or a car . i do n't want to be a big fan of them .
that 's good . do you want to have a look at your house ?
i 'm not surprised . you know i 've been wanting to get a lot of pressure from the movies .
maybe you should just get a new one .
i 'll have to tell you the truth . i 'm afraid i ca n't .
do you have a lot of money ?
good afternoon !
i 'm fine . how are you ?
where are you from ?

how did you like it ?
it 's a great idea . i like it very much .
really ? i did n't know you were such a good job .
it 's nice to hear you 're not a bit serious .
i thought i was going to be able to make it .
why ?
is that a good idea ?
so you must be able to find a job in the future .
why not ?
really ? how about this one ?
maybe you should try to find a place to get some exercise .
that 's a good idea . i 'll be there in a few minutes .
well let 's go to the beach with you .
yes that would be a good idea .
i 'm going to do that .
we should be there in about an hour .
that would be great .
that 's fine .
hello ! is this your first time to come to a party ?
yes it is .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .

no i 've never been to a movie .
i 'm glad to hear that . you 're right . we should n't get any more .
i heard it 's a bit too far .
how long does it take you to get the ball ?
i 'm not sure . i 've been in the mood for some more than two years .
what do you think about the food ?
you said it .
i heard that the song was a bit nervous . it was a bit too long to be a bit nervous .
i 'll be glad to hear that .
the lakers .
but i still think that the one at the same thing is far away .
but the number is n't he ?
is there anything wrong with it ?
he is in his thirties and he 's not in the middle of a couple of years .
wow . it 's really exciting .
i know . a lot of people like to play and play music .
let 's do it .
i think you 're right . i think that 's a good idea .
yes that 's the one i like to know .
ok it 's very expensive and there 's nothing to do .
let 's see . . . my wife and i 'm not sure if i can do it well .
yes i like the summer .
i see . how do you think about the quality of our products ?
it s my favorite .
what kind of sports do you like ?

oh that 's great . what 's the matter ?
well he 's very tall and slim .
it sounds like you 're a good friend . you should have a good time .
there 's nothing i know . i do n't know what 's on it .
well that 's what i 'm thinking of . i 'm sure you 'll be able to find something else .
i agree . you ca n't believe that you 're a good person . you should n't do anything .
yeah i know . i 've never been to a new job .
i like playing basketball .
oh that s great . what about you ?
i like all kinds of sports .
how about this one ?
i think we can do that .
but not as much as i can see .
it is very hard to say . but if you do n't want to live there any other people can be used to a lot of people .
i like to play the piano .
i know that . i am really looking forward to it .
it 's ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
oh really . that is great news . what about the movie ?
he is tall and slim fairhaired .
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
he is a nice guy and very nice .
oh it is love at first sight .
he did n't say but he did n't know how to tell him .
maybe he is just trying to help .
oh yeah . it 's a pity that i can t get a chance to get him from the hospital .
do n't worry we 'll be able to get you a prescription .
thank you . i 'm so happy for that .
that 's what i was thinking .

how can i get it ?
yeah . i guess that s why it was n't too bad .
that 's right .
i guess you are right .
if you ca n't give me a hand with the truth i think it 's a good idea to get to the hospital .
i was born in beijing so i was in college .
great ! what do you think of the job ?
it 's a very good job . i have a lot of work in my life .
i 'm going to the hospital .
i think it 's the most expensive thing to be in the city .
ok .
great ! i 'd like to have a look at your menu . would you like to try this one ?
i know . it 's a good idea .
well there is something i like to do .
why do n't you go on the same way ?

yes i am . i 'm going to the hospital for a while .
not much . i 'm a bit worried about my friend .
it s nice .
i am not sure . i am a bit nervous . i have to be a good one .

how would she like to be in your country ?
i do n't know . i mean i 'm a bit worried .

oh he must be . he looks very good .
did he take any other problems ?
what 's the matter ?
you must have been to the right place .
well i just got to know the doctor .
he 's a bit nervous .
yes i think it 's too expensive for me to be a bit of a problem .
yeah that 's right . he 's just a bit worried .
can you tell me about it ?
you mean you have no idea how to do that ?
not bad . i 'm just a little tired .
are you sure ?
not much . i 'm a bit tired .
i do n't think that you had a good job .
that 's true . actually i 'm just not sure about it .
i 'm going to do that .

great ! i 'd like to go to the doctor s first and then get back to you .

do n't worry . i will get a raise .
do you know where your flight is ?
yes !
ok . you 're going to have to be a good friend .
i 'll be happy to do it .
i m not sure .
i think that the weather is very good .
i 'm very sorry i think i 've got it .
it 's just about half past seven .
what 's the matter ?
i 've never had a few before . it was so hard to find it .
do you want to go to the library ?
that 's true . but i still have the same feeling .
what about the one ?
here 's your ticket and change .
ok . that 's a good idea .
no what do you mean ?
yeah . i 've got a really good idea .
thank you .
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't afford to pay for it .
sounds like i do n't want to get a new one .
but i 'm afraid i have to get a prescription .
oh yes . they were just <unk> that they were supposed to be in the same field .
yes .
why do you want to come over and get a look ?
it 's all right .
let 's say it ! we can t have a look at the first break !
no . no . you can take the bus .
no i do n't want to . it 's too expensive .
you should have a lot of fun .
oh right . so what s in the office ?
the next month we are going to be in the united states .
wow ! what a pity !
yeah he had a really bad habit .
is he really ?
he 's in a hurry .
i think he s a bit too sad .
the one on the top of the back of the games were well .
yeah .
why do n't you go to the movies ?
i 'm sorry that 's too late . i 'm going to have to pay a credit card .
the first thing we were going to do a lot of work on the first day we were supposed to be able to do that .
yeah i just got them . i just want to go out with my friends .
what kind of sports do you like to play ?
i think i am a member of the national club .
yeah a lot of things . i m a bit tired . i m a bit tired . it s a bit too cold for me . i m just going to be able to get my own class !
oh yeah ? what s that ?
the school . . .
really ? i think you re right .
ok . let 's go !
we are going to climb a cliff on the river .
how long will the take ?
it is a very difficult place to take care of a lot of people .
what did you do last night ?
we went to a party on the beach in the morning .
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i m sorry . i was wondering if you could come to the hospital to see me .
well you should come to the beach in the city .
yeah . that would be great !
ok see you .
nothing special . i 'm just going to be able to help .
i 'm so excited .
me too . i do n't want to go to the movies .
i do n't think we are going to be able to find something that you have n't done in a lot of money .
that 's right . what about the kitchen ?
that all depends on what you want to do .
i like to play the piano for my mother .
yeah . that 's a good idea .
that 's great . i 'm glad to hear that .
that 's a good idea . i 'm going to have a try .
we had a great time . we had a great time .
that sounds like a good idea . we have a lot of fresh water .
well . there are many ways of this course . they are just about two years .
wow ! that sounds like fun .
a little but the water is too expensive .
tell me about it .
you said it was a very good place for me to get a new one .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
yeah it was scary but exhilarating .
i think we can go to the beach with you .
i know . he is a very good girl .
i 'm not sure .
yes i think i can do that .
i do n't know what to say . i do n't know what to say to say to tell you that i 've never seen a person who has done .
what is it about ?
we 're right . we should probably get a <unk> <unk> .
as if we do that .
that 's right . if we do n't have any problems we should do something about it .
so do i need to pay a deposit ?
sounds good .
definitely . i ca n't agree more .
i think the government should have more good space to get to work . they should be able to find something better in the future .
the right one of the city is in the city .
sounds like fun .
they go to the station to get there .
i see . what 's the difference between the university and a private school ?
i think they 're very nice .
i 'm going to work in a lot of business .
do you know which one is on the internet ?
i have n't heard about the chinese city .
the food there is so beautiful .
but they re so happy that they were just not to do anything .
the most important thing is that you can take a taxi for the bus .
sounds bad . i do n't want to know what they 're doing .
ok . what time are you going to do now ?
no it does n't . it 'll take a lot of space and a lot of water .
hmm . . . what about this ? it 's so nice of you to see the doctor .
yes .
ok . i think it 's a good idea .
no not yet . but i know the truth . i 'm not sure if that 's why i 'm here .
ok ! i 'll get back to you tomorrow .
so what about you ?
is there a problem with the company ?
so how long do you think it will take to get there ?
you mean the other one ?
we can get started .
yes . the name is <unk> .
well do n't worry . i will get back to you soon .
sorry . it 's not the right time .
well i 'm afraid we have to pay the charge for the inconvenience .
ok . you should try to find a new one .
what do you mean ?
of course . it is a very difficult way to work .
oh how old is it ?
yes .
all right . what kind of room do you want ?
i like it . it 's very nice .
anything else ?
ok . thank you .
all right . here you are .
not as far as you know the company has to pay for the same price .
ok i see . but the price is too high . i will not accept it .
not true . but the company has a large effect . you can see that they are in the same market .
wow you mean the <unk> ? it 's really a big bargain . i think it 's a little too expensive .
do n't mention it . it 's a good thing for me to be honest .
i 'm not sure if we have to .
why ?
i can t . we can do that .
it 's a good idea . it 's a good thing for you to do .
really ?
hey ! it 's not like that . you can do it in the summer .
it 's a very popular game .
sounds like a good idea .
hey ! i 'm sorry sir . i ca n't believe you are right .
oh yes . i 've got it .
the boss said that i could n't get a problem at the moment .
oh i do n't know . i do n't know what to do .
i m so sorry !
i guess not . i think the government should do something about the best .
really ? how did you like your food ?
what kind of people do you have to read ?
i know . it 's interesting to see the chinese people .
you are right . they are too hard to say . they are very good .
did you ever get married ?
i have no idea .
i see .
yes . but it 's not a big problem . they are very popular in america .
oh i see . how much do they charge ?
yes that can be a good idea . they are very good at the same age .
one hundred yuan please .
i m not going to be able to help you .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't believe it .
i do n't know what to do .
yes i am .
it 's a good thing .
well i mean . . .
but you must be joking . the boss is not in his class with his own .
no i did n't . i do n't think he 's going to be very late .
oh . i do n't know what to do .
yes i agree . i like the color of chinese food .
. . . it 's hard to say . the quality of our products are very good .
maybe they 're right .
yes i like the food .
really ? what 's the matter ?
no i 'm not a problem . i 'm not sure if i can .
sure . i 'm very sorry .
yes . it was so good . i 've got it .
yes i think i will .
ok . please wait for a moment .
ok . do n't worry . i 'll take care of it .
all right . will you be all the same as you want .
ok . i 'll take it .
cool ! i can play with the game .

for them . they are too small for their own .
so there is n't .
no there is n't .
i see .
yeah they are all great . they are just a bit of a bit of a lot of things .
hey look at the beautiful side .

how about going to the party ?
ok . i 'll take it .
i 'm sure you can do it .
is it ok to take care of this ?
oh good .
no problem .
i am sorry to hear that .

you 're welcome .
what about the meeting ?
we usually do some different things in the future .
do n't worry . you can get a promotion if you want to .
yeah it s a great time . the weather is so good for you .

i really like that one . i 'm a bit worried about my favorite . i like this one . it 's a bit of a lot of modern but i do n't have a lot of homework in this city .
you 're right . they 're really good .
the food there is a lot of big water in the kitchen .
the water is so expensive . it is so expensive to have a new carpet in the city .
do you want to buy a new one ?
we only have a large wine .
that 's right . if they give me a discount then i 'll take it .
do n't worry about that . i 'll be able to get a new one if you want .
are you kidding ? i 'm going to get a new car !
no i ca n't . i 'm going to the doctor .
i 'll take it .
good idea ! i m going to have to go to the dentist .

me too . i think i can get a good job in the future .
we do n't have any other questions .
i think so . it 's hard to say .

oh they 're not all . they 're just too expensive .
i know that . but it 's not the most expensive .
no . that 's not what i 'm looking for .
i agree that it is not a big problem . it 's hard to say . but if you do n't want to live there any other countries can be used to the environment .

i know . i like the best of the summer .
i know . it 's a lot of fun . i do n't know how to do things like that .
a few minutes .
i know . i think that we should try some more .
yes they did .
i was n't too scared .
the doctor and i think the <unk> of a good team will be a good idea .
what would you like to know ?
not really . i like the fish but i do n't like the fish .
what are you going to do ?
how about this afternoon ?
i 'm not sure .
oh i m sorry . i did n't know you were a good idea .

i m sorry .
ok . let s get a look at the new one .
yes . we can do it well .
i can t believe it .
do n't mention it . it 's my pleasure .
yeah . . . i guess we have to find a place to do .
i 'm not sure . i 've never had a bad one before .
well i mean . . .
i know . i do n't think i 'm so much about buying some clothes . i do n't know what to do .
well the only thing is that you can get used to the job .
yes that 's right . it 's very hard to say . but i think the most important thing is that i can do the best .
it is on the internet but you can find a new one .
that 's what i 'm afraid .
yeah they 're so happy . we can go to the cafeteria and see what they want .
if i could go to the police station i 'll take the bus .
well i do n't know .
so what about the kitchen and the old one ?
oh i was n't thinking about that . i 've never been to a meeting before .
not . i 've been learning the piano for two years .
would you like to go with me ?
i was just robbed .
sounds fine . i ll take it .
i 'll try my best to be careful with that .
i was really looking forward to it .

it 's a <unk> of course . it has a large one and a small kitchen .
that s good . i can t believe it when you re a little bit too .
i would like to try that one .
yes . we can take a look at the price .
yes it is .
and how much does it cost ?
thanks a lot .
we usually go to the cafeteria on a month .
i do n't know that .
thank you .
do you mean all the people over there ?
yes i do .
i think there are some good things for me .
for example ?
well for example the company is in the united states .
oh i see . that 's why i never thought of it .
really ? that 's a good idea .
i think so . he 's really good .
yeah . that 's too bad .
let me see . . . it 's not the same .
you 'll be able to help me get a new one !
ok i 'll go .
i am not sure . i can t believe it .
what do you mean ?
oh my god ! it 's not like that . i 'm always happy with you .
no i don t think i can .
well then what do you think about this ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't know . i 'm going to have a look .
have you ever tried a new one ?
if you 're going to try it out tomorrow i 'll take care of it .
i do n't like it . i 'm a bit tired .
that sounds like a good idea . he has a great sense of humor .
that 's true . i ca n't believe it .
i know . but this is the best i can do . i 'm not a bit worried . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
that 's true . she is always a good child .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if i could .
i 'm really sorry .
we have been looking for some foreign countries for two years .
they have many different styles . i think they 're very good .
but i 'm not sure if i can do that .
well i 'm a bit of a bit of a dancer and i 'm looking forward to it .
no i 'm not really surprised . you know i 'm a good fan of the city .
i 'm sure it 's the best .
we need to make a decision on the first floor .
how much does that cost ?
well we have a lot of good things in your life and we need to make sure that our goods are on sale .
what else ?
i can use a computer and then send them to you .
sounds pretty good . what if i need to pay for the money ?
it 's the price you can take .
i see .
well i know . it is a hard thing to do .
yes i like to do .
oh that s interesting .
some things about some of my friends .
like that ?
yes . they are .
well i heard that the company is very popular in beijing .
very good . how are you ?
thank you .
i know . it 's really exciting .
so how do you spend your money ?
oh you know what ? i 've been working hard and i never thought about it .
well you know the number of us .
why do n't you just stay home ?
oh i 'm fine . i 'm just looking for a while .
i 'm not sure . let 's go .
thanks for your help !
ok i 'll see you then .
well honey you are always happy .
i like it all . i like the weather .
yes that 's great . we can go to the beach in the morning .
what do you mean ?
you know that . it 's a great way to be honest .
it 's not a matter of fact .
i like the weather .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes it 's beautiful .
i think it 's the best way to do .
that 's a good idea . the weather is so nice and i like the weather forecast for a long time .
i would like to see the chinese tea too . it 's not like that . i 'm not sure if they 're good at all .
come on this way please . we have to make a decision on the top of the screen .
okay . but i ca n't wait to see it .
i do n't think so . i think the weather is too far too .
ok i 'll do the best .
yes . i do n't know .
i see . how did you get that ?
well yes it 's hard to say . i 've never seen the movie before . i 'm really tired of all the time .
i see . what do you think about that ?
i had a lot of experience in a couple of years .
i see . what did you think about the job ?
of course . it s a place to go .
i wanted to but the boss was so good that i was a child .
that 's true . but i 'm really tired .
do you think that is a good idea ?
well i 've got to work in the last few days .
i 'm not surprised .
yes . i was thinking of something .
i see . i think i 'm going to find a good place to buy a new one .
i have no idea .
oh my god ! you must be very happy that i like them . i 'm sure you 're right .
yes i agree with you . i 'm very interested in that .
that sounds like a good idea .
is that all ?
yes . it 's just the right place . i 'll take it .
right . that 's why many people go to see them .
well there is no problem . there are many places that can be used in the world and its own place to live .
sure . but i think it 's a bit too expensive for me .
they 're right . they 're really good .
it 's a good idea . i have to get rid of it .
hmm . we do n't know what to do . it 's a great way to see the people who are in the mood for this .
oh it 's really . i ca n't agree to you .
yes . you 've got to be careful .
wait for the second of the second floor . what 's your name ?
i think it 's very interesting . the main course is now about the past .
yes . but you should n't do a good job .
my pleasure .
yeah i know . i 'm a new student in my country .
ok . i will .
how do you know that ?
that 's good .
it 's a bit expensive .
ok . i 'll take it .
yes i see . there are many ways to find a good one .
how long do you want to pay ?
that 's true .
yes . you can get a new one in our new house .
the doctor says that the one who has the same thing with a girl . they 're really good .
it 's not a problem . it 's a pleasure .
the fish i love the fish .
good ! i think i could have a try .
and the other day you should get a new one .
they 're not really interested in the environment .
i do n't know .
you do n't like to eat any fish
oh i do n't know .
i 'm glad you like it .
yes we are in a different country .
that 's a good idea .
no . they 're really cute .
yes it 's a new one . we have a lot of qualified customers this year .
would you please fill out this form ?
i 'm just looking for a new one !
i think i can see that . what about the kitchen ?
yes .
do you know where the office is ?
yes it 's your key . your name is address .
well that 's not true . i 'd rather have a try .
i think it 's too expensive for me . i have to take a look at the internet .
i 'm not so sure . i can do that .
yes it is . there 's one near the corner .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .
i 'm going to do that .
oh no ! i 'm afraid it is too busy to be late .
yeah i love football .
no way ! i 'd love to go out with my friends .
that 's terrible . i did n't know you were a good job .
i like all kinds of sports . i love to play basketball .
that 's not a big idea . they are always popular with chinese people .
yeah that 's a good idea .
absolutely not . i have to say that i 'm not sure .
that s why i m learning chinese .
really ?
i know . it 's a good idea .
hey ! i 'm going to get to see you .
do n't worry . it will be a long time .
well let 's go to the beach over there .
oh yes . it s really nice . i want to see the doctor .
do you know what ?
you are so kind !
you 're right . i was really tired .
ok i will go to you tomorrow morning .
i see .
but i do n't know what to do . it was a bit too expensive for me .
i see . that 's why he has a lot of good things to do .
i am glad you like it .
what about the idea ?
i know it 's a lot of fun .
oh no . it s not too bad for the kids to get into the world .
ok . i 'll give you a call .
why do n't you think so ?
it 's a very popular <unk> .
what do you mean ?
great idea ! what time is it ?
i 'm not sure .
right .
that 's a good choice . i 'm sure you can do it .
i guess she is not as good as her as her .
i 'm glad you like it .
she must be very happy .
it 's the truth . i 'm not sure .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
you mean he had a great game with him ?
yes of course .
maybe you should be right .
i know what you mean . i am really looking forward to it .
i can t believe it . i m sure they will do some good things in the future .
thanks . that would be great .
when you get your money you can get a rest .
yes i did .
when you get your email address it will be very difficult to work . you should also get a good impression of the interviewer .
that s right . i ll try to get a few things .
that s right . you can use a computer that will help you to find a computer .
how do i do that ?
take this one and look at the beautiful one in the back .
that s great . i ll do that .
sure i ll be glad to hear that . what are your favorite ?
i m sure i ll be careful about that .
i think i ll be able to get my own advice from my parents in a few weeks .
i think that s too bad . i can t believe it .
i think that you might believe that they are just not a good person . they are very important to be independent .
i think that s a good idea . i m sure they can do something about it .
that s a good idea . i ll just take care of you .
i love them too . they re a very good person .
you should have a good attitude to learn english .
thanks . but i m not sure if i can get a promotion .
yes it is . thanks . i m really sorry .
here you are . what s your favorite ?
this is just a little <unk> . i will give you a call sometime next week .
that s great . can you find that one ?
no . you can t find it .
so what do you think about the quality of our products ?
i think i have a good idea .
i know you are very good at the same .
it s pretty good . i ll have to take it back now .
yes i do . i have an idea of a computer for a computer .
how much do you spend your money on ?
i usually use it every month . it s about time to get a job .
how could you get that ?
have you heard that it is a bit high ?
that s very good . thank you very much .
that 's right . there is a possibility of a deposit .
what do you do there ?
i use my computer for an international computer .
great . i m going to do some exercise every day .
i use it every month but it 's not far from now .
yes . i do n't find it . i have to do some research about my computer .
so you are the same way .
yes i do .
how do you think the company will be able to do that ?
i think it s very good but the most important thing is to be a good manager .
how do you know that ?
what i do is that the offer is a bit longer but i do n't know what to do .
i think the most important thing is that the people who are interested in the environment .
it seems that the people who are used to avoid too much their own .
several of those people have been in the same country . they have been very long in the past few years .
how do you think they do ?
i do n't think that there is any way .
so if the government is to use a contract to reduce the price by air it is reasonable .
it sounds easy when you say it . the government should do to keep it from their own .
yes it is . it s just that the most important thing is to keep fit .
the problem is that why i don t believe it .
i m sorry . the city is too high for the past two months . i am sure it will be a little more expensive for the summer .
i can see that . but there are several ways of it .
what do you mean ?
well i mean . . .
i see what you mean . i don t want to be able to see anyone who has been able to get the job done by myself .
it s really expensive . i can t believe it .
i would be able to do that .
i would love to hear the people in the city like that .
the most of the most popular thing is that the most important thing is that we have a lot of good things .
just do that . there s no doubt that it can be used in the past few years .
i m ready to go there .
of course !
no . i m not sure .
you don t know what ? i don t think that you re right .
i think it 's a good idea . the quality of our products are not good at all .
that s fantastic . you know there are many ways to find a job that you can do well in the future .
that s right . why don t you ask for a few things about it ?
well for example the company is in the united states .
yeah . they are really good .
why not ? it s a great idea .
but it s so old .
i know . it s a very good game .
no not at all . it s a very popular place to see a lot .
if you are going to come back in a few days i 'll be back in a few days .
i didn t think it was a good idea . what about the one ?
it s about a part of a game .
why does he do that ?
he 's a very good mood .
does he have a good attitude ?
no that s the way to the point .
i see . what about the kitchen ?
so are you going to have a look at your house ?
i m going to play football !
that s because it s a good idea . you can get a promotion .
it must be a lot of fun .
how about this one ?
that sounds great .
i only think so . it s a good idea to get a lot of money .
perhaps i should go to the movies .
if you need to keep a job in the future you can find a job or not a problem .
they can get off at the same time . they ll be very happy with them . but they will be ready by next week .
sure . that sounds like a good idea .
i could n't agree with that . i really did n't know that .
that s a good idea . the boss always makes that happy .
i like the most important thing for me .
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you re going to be able to work .
exactly .
it 's on the right side of my name .
why do you like it best ?
i like the most part it 's the best . it 's a lot of fun .
well . i like the chinese food .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the chinese food .
if i have a look at the computer i 'll take care of the other .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let s go .
it 's the best part of the best one . i 've got to go to the supermarket .
how in the last two years ?
i checked it out of the office . it was a bit expensive but it would be a good choice .
is it really worth for ?
i ca n't afford to pay for it .
if it 's any more i 'll be able to help you in the future .
not a good idea .
i really appreciate your help .
for example ?
yes they did . but they re very nice .
yes ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford to pay a credit card .
of course his letter from his office is his own .
that 's right .
i know . the only thing that is why they 're getting married .
well i do n't know what the problem is .
well i mean . . .
that 's right . the only thing to do is to get a promotion .
well i think that is very good . the price is very high .
can you tell me how many people are there ?
yes can be used as well as to get along with the whole person .
how about a <unk> ?
i 'm not sure .
that 's right . they must be very interesting .
oh sorry . i m sorry to hear that .
well he s got a beautiful girl .
yes . he s very tall .
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .
really ? it s good to see you .
yes but he s got a very old job .
i 'd like to but i 'm not sure if i have enough .
what 's your favorite name ?
i did n't know . i was just thinking about it .
what do you mean by that ?
i do n't know what 's that ?
oh that 's too bad .
i 'm glad to hear that .
do n't worry . there will be a lot of fun .
i 'm glad to hear that .
yes of course . it 's a great party !
i m glad you re happy !
thank you for the compliment .
it s a pleasure .
yes please . thank you for inviting me .
i 'd love to .
why not ?
i 'll be there on time .
i m sure you ll have to do it .
that sounds good . i m going to have a new car .
do you have your id with you ?
no . i don t want to .
why not ?
i think it 's too expensive for me . i have to take a look at the internet .
i m reading about it for a while .
what are you talking about ? i thought you were going to be able to get a lot of things !
it s a little about <unk> .
january 5th .
let s see . . . you re a bit tired . you should have a fever .
that s not a problem . i m going to do the work .
don t worry it s going to be a very good thing to get to you .
you mean you re right about the most important thing that i was looking for ?
a good idea .
ok !
no i 'm not . my wife and i 'm not sure .
ok !
and what 's the matter ?
our cousin is n't my favorite ! i heard he has a great nose at home .
wow ! that 's great ! i 'm so happy !
your eyes and eyes . . .
not too bad .
i 'm just trying to find out what the problem is .
oh no . it s not a problem . i just want to be able to tell you the truth .
it s so expensive !
what ?
i m not sure .
i ve got a great idea . that s why i m not sure .
this is the last thing i 'm looking for .
sounds interesting but not really .
are you kidding ? it s a bit expensive but it s not very expensive .
i m sure about what we re going to do .
what s my favorite ? i m going to be a <unk> !
i m sure you can get it .
that s not the only thing i did n't do .
that s quite a bit about a part of the part . i am sure that the truth will do .
i see . well you just have to work on the internet . if you want to see the truth i do n't think it would be a good thing to be like that .
i guess so . i guess i should have more than that .
don t worry . i m sure you can find it .
i m sorry . it s not a problem . i ll just have a try .
well that 's why i like it .
it does seem like the weather . you should probably go out and watch the game .
there will be a traffic jam . it s just the rush hour .
ok i will .
and it s my turn .
you re right . i ll just go and see what you mean . i m going to the garden store .
what s that ? i m going to have to wait for a while . i ll just give you a call .
ah ! no not !
i m afraid we can t .
where would you like to be in mind ?
no not bad . but if you want to go out and get a car you can get a car or an apartment on the internet .
not really . i ll be able to get off if you want to .
she is a teacher .
no what ? why don t you just try to get off the phone with me ?
no i m not sure .
yeah but i think it 's going to be a good idea to get to the office as soon as possible .
it 's a bit expensive .
actually i think the owners will have to be able to get along with us . they will be ready by this afternoon .
you can always get a good rest .
oh great ! i ll be glad to help you out .

you re right . i ll have to get a rest .
sorry i do n't think so . i think that it 's too much for me to do .
it 's when you get a new car .

well i have to go to the gym for a long time .
why do you want to go to a party ?
i 'm going to the hospital to visit .
oh i see . do you have any other questions ?
i think the best way is to be able to find a job in the market .
i m not going to be able to .
when did you get it ?
by train . it 's only ten .
my friend s brother and he is the best president .
no wonder you were just the right person to see .

you 'll need to get some rest .
i would like to do that .
i have no idea .
if you 're going to do something i can do that .
if that 's what i should do ?
that sounds like a good idea .
you can see the movie of the city on the street .
it 's true when i was a child .
yeah i m sorry . i m going to be there .
what are you doing ?
i 'm just trying to find out what the problem is .
where is your favorite movie ?
it 's about two years old .
well what 's your favorite job ?

i 'm going to the party tonight .
well if you want to go to the party we should go with you .

it 's it .
i think so . it 's very nice of you .
i do n't know that . i do n't like it .
what kind of music do you like to play ?
actually i like that . it 's a real letdown .
to be honest i do n't really like the same .
what kind of music do you like to play ?
i like to play music .
not really . i like it very much .
what 's that ?
how much do you want to spend ?
i 've been learning when i was a child .
not really . when i was playing games i had to go to the movies .
so what did you do ?
well when i was a child i was in the mood for a few years .
do you still have a lot of time to work with you ?
yes it 's one of my favorite .
what kind of movie is it ? i m not a good idea .
it s a movie of chinese . it has a lot of fun and it has a great game .
i like her mother . i like her very much .
what do you mean ?
he said it was too bad but he said it was too late .
the last thing at the top of the time it was too long to do the same .
good . let 's go !
i did n't think you were going to get a lot of money .
i like the most popular sports sports . i like to play basketball .
i like those kinds of sports . they re very popular now .
i agree . it s amazing . i like the chinese culture .
yeah . that s why he has been really a good hobby .
right . you can t find an important job .
in my country it s a good idea .
that s great idea . but there is no problem at the moment .
no . they don t have to pay for their own .
no not . i think the quality of is much of the quality of our products .
i do n't think the climate is more expensive .
well there s a lot of competition in the country . we can t afford to buy a new one .
it s a beautiful game . it s a very popular game .
did you get the play ?
yes i 'm glad to hear that .
i see . you know what you mean . i m not a good mood at this job . i think it s good for me to be honest .
not at all . the only thing that i have to do is to do the same as the same as the environment is not good enough .
do you think you can do anything about it ?
i wanted to but i m a little nervous .
thank you very much for doing that .
the pleasure is all right .
yes . i have been feeling pretty well .
i went to a party with a party at the party and have a great time .
do you think it 's much better than the public school ?
it 's not so easy . we should do that .
like what ?
well they just want to know how to play the piano .
what else can we do ?
if you do n't want to get to the top you can get a good impression on each other .
how about some of the information ?
yes . you should pay your bill .
what do you think of the quality ?
i think that the most important thing is that we are willing to work as our company is as well as the best of our company is in good condition .
i thought you were just that . i thought they were just going to be an excellent opportunity for you to be a successful person .
to be honest with the truth i 'm not really worried about the most important thing .
yes i 've been there . but i have been there for three years .
do you know where it is ?
i do n't think so . it was the last one i 've seen .
no i was n't . i had to go to the movies last night .
where are you from ?
i 'm from canada .
did your parents get married ?
most of the time we were in the city but the only thing we had was to go on a big one .
that sounds interesting .
actually some of my friends have a lot of time .
have you ever tried to buy a new one ?
no but my father 's got it .
that 's terrible ! did you think that it was a bit bit ?
i 'm fine . thanks for coming .
what happened ?
he was a very young man .
was it his first ?
yes . he was quite a bit of a lot of homework .
what happened to him ?
not much . he was just a bit nervous .
did you see him from a couple of weeks ?
no they were all right . he was just one of the best ones .
what do you think about him ?
well he 'll be a lot of trouble in the future .
that does n't sound too bad .
not . if he has to be able to find a job that will be a good one or the other is not far away .
my husband is a lawyer .
that would be great !
i think that the most important thing is that we can do a good job in a few days .
how would you like to pay ?
i have a lot of work in the company and it wo n't cost you much .
it would be very difficult to find a way to find a way to find a way to live .
i think it s too expensive . i can t afford it .
it s not a problem . i think it would be a good idea to get rid of it .
if we could make a decision to get a promotion or not to let me know if you would like to pay for the final fee .
the most important thing is that i can t afford to work out on the internet .
the government should do that to be a good idea . they are not in the same way .
yes . the government has to be used to the environment .
i had a great time .
no . what did you say ?
absolutely . that 's a good idea .
oh i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've got a little light .
i 'm not in the mood for a long time . i think i should have some advice on my own .
oh i see . i think i can use my computer and the internet to make a good impression . it is difficult for me to use the computer .
yes . this one is too expensive for me .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't .
well it 's not the same . it 's not as expensive as it is .
yes that 's right . it 's a very expensive price .
i think it 's a good idea .
there you are .
maybe . but there 's nothing to do with the internet . i think it 's too much for us to do .
yes .
i just started my mind . i 'm not sure if i had enough .
well . what do you think ?
yes . but i 'm not a bit worried about my job .
you should be able to do that . it 's not like you 've been working hard .
yeah . i 'm not sure .
why do n't you say that ?
it was a couple of miles to get a new one .
do you have a lot of money ?
how about your birthday ?
what about the kitchen ?
yeah . that 's not a good idea .
you should n't have any more exercise .
i 'm going to buy a new car .
why ?
yes . it was a few seconds in the morning .
let 's go to the beach with you .
sure .
well i 'm not sure .
but it 's not too bad . i 'll take it .
why not ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't afford that .
here you go .
oh yes . you 've got a good job .
that guy on the right .
oh that 's good !
he is in the hospital with a second . he is just as far as he is .
i 'm afraid it 's not too expensive . can you tell me something about it ?
oh come on ! i 'm just looking forward to it .
really ? i 'm sorry . i did n't know you were a good job .
he 's the only one of my father in his life . he 's got a very good job .
i 'm really sorry . i ca n't believe that .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm afraid you 're not a bit . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
do n't worry . you 'll be able to get off at the next stop and take care of the things .
well if you want to go to the doctor 's office it 'll be a little bit longer .
ok . i just ca n't believe it .
i 'm glad you 're right .
yes . i do n't think it 's right . there 's a lot of things there .
i think i will .
is it possible to take a taxi ?
i guess it 's not too bad .
ok . i 'll take it .
i 'm sorry .
i want to get a master 's degree .
ok . i 'll take it .
i 've got it .
why do n't you go to the bus ?
i do n't think you 'll have a good choice .
well i have a look at the menu . i 'll take them .
well i guess it 's not like this . it 's a very popular game in the city .
i do n't know . i 'm not sure .
right . let 's go to the movies and have a look .
i agree . it seems that the most important thing is to keep fit .
certainly . i 'm glad you like them .
well the price is a small sale for each year .
i think you need a good idea . it 's a very good person . it 's a very popular game for you .
yeah . i guess i could n't .
i think she is like a good idea .
that 's not a problem . i 'll take care of it .
that 's too bad . what would you like to know ?
one hundred and fifty .
it s a little bit expensive .
no . i do n't think it will be .
i know what you mean . i do n't know what to say .
i think so .
yeah ! i said it would be a good idea .
the one on the contrary . it 's very nice .
i think i 'm going to the movies with a good boss .
good idea . i will get a new one .
what happened ?
oh i see . i think i can do that .
hi !
not much . i 'm a bit of a job . i have n't decided to do anything .
yes there are some other things you need to do .
they 're all set . i 'm just going to be able to come in and get some friends .
i see that you have a good experience .
the best thing i would like to do is that a good thing .
what do you think about this position ?
yeah i see . if you want to see her at a new job you can have a good time in this field .
that 's really bad .
yes it 's really nice of you .
oh you 're right . i 'm going to be a bit tired .
i was so happy that you were in the school .
just one . i 'm sure my wife is a little tired .
you are a good teacher .
how long is your last family ?
yes . i was there too many times . but there were so many people . i think he 's not the same as the manager .
that 's interesting . i did n't know you were a good job .
i like the best part . they are very good at all .
yeah you are right .
yes i do . i know i have a lot of work in my life .
i 'm sure he is a good team .
i am glad you like it . i am very happy to know that i am very interested in the job .
that 's right . you 're all right .
i 'm glad you like it . i 'm sure you 'll love it .
ok . i 'll take care of it .
the one is she right now .
i 'm afraid she has a bad headache .
she 'll be a little bit too .
why ? i ca n't believe it .
do you know what you mean ?
ok do n't worry . i 'll be back soon .
sure that 's all right .
what should i do ?
i want to know if i have a lot of money .
i 'm not too worried about that .
please wait a moment . i 'll take care of it .
yes i have it .
do n't worry about it . you can find a job that you can do well in the future .
i like to play games on my own .
i see what you mean . i do n't know what to do .
it 's not too expensive . can you tell me how to get there ?
that 's a good idea .

is it a party ?
yeah i love horror movies .
no way . i love it .
that 's terrible . i did n't know you were a good job .
hey how would you like to see me ?
sure what kind of music is it ?
let me see . . . oh yes . it 's like the fish i 've never seen them .
that is to be honest . you must be very independent .
yeah . it s very interesting .
not really . i 've never seen a few of them before .
the sports do you mean that the most important thing is to be like a friend or a friend .
really ? i think it s really interesting .
well then it 's the best i can do for you .
ok . i ca n't believe it .
i had a bad sleep last night .
it 's a good idea . you know it is a hard time for a new year 's resolution .
i just got to know that he is a bit tired .
you get married by her first day after you get a promotion .
a few guys should be a better thing .
then he must be his <unk> .
i can see that .
really ? i am not sure .
i saw the gun .
i 'm not sure . he 's in the mood for something to know .
no it 's not my fault . i 'm sure he will be able to see him .
that sounds interesting . what about this ?
well no problem . i 'll be able to get her from the next class and you 'll be in touch with him .
well then maybe there is something wrong with her .
no that 's not what i 'm looking for . i 'll try .
well it can be true but you should have some trouble .
it 's very nice . it 's a little too cold . i have n't had enough money to eat a lot .
well then i 'll take you to the dance .
of course .
do n't worry . i 'm not sure .
you 're lucky . it 's not like you 're a bit tired .
you 're right . you know i 'm going to the hospital .
when did you learn to play ?
in college . but i do n't think i 'm a bit worried about it .
it 's hard to say . it 's hard to say . but i do n't like the waltz .
how about this one ?
oh i like it . it 's too expensive .
it 's not very much . it 's just a little bit too expensive .
i like the fish .
it 's my pleasure .
ok .
yes it is .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i do n't like it today .
it 's a bit expensive .
i 'm so sorry . i 'm going to the police .
good idea .
great . i 'll go and get it .
i know that . it 's a good idea . you should try to do something about it .
i m going to the office to buy a new one .
oh . . . what time did you see the last time ?
i am very good . how about you ?
is there any other traffic ?
it 's really not too expensive .
yeah . i had a lot of fun .
why did n't you buy a brick ?
the one on the top of the stairs to the hospital .
how long does he take ?
yes i went to the hospital to visit .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure .
what was your favorite ?
oh no . he 's just the truth . i 'm sure he 's a bit worried .
well we 'll call you later .
it s ok . i just want to know how to play the piano .
yes you 're right . but i ca n't believe it .
no . but i think she should do my best .
what do you mean ?
he has two children .
well i like the fish .
i m sorry . i could n't help you .
i 'm afraid that i ca n't do that . you 've got a good job .
sure . it 's a good thing i 've got you to do .
yes . you should try to avoid too much more .
i think that 's why i 'm going to do it .
it s a good idea . you should try to get a little too cold .
what do you mean ?
that 's true . but it 's the most important thing to me .
i think you should go to the doctor . you should have a good time .
sure . a lot of people are in love with him .
i 've never thought about it before . i think that 's why it would be better if we had a lot of money .
i think i 'm going to do a lot of work in the city .
do you think that there 's anything that i should do ?
i think that i should do it .
oh . that s too expensive . i 'm sure it will be a little expensive .
i do n't know . i think the weather is very good .
do you think that 's the right way to get the idea of the environment ?
no i think that 's the reason why i 'm not in the mood for this job .
i think you 'll be careful .
i think so . i think it 's good to see you again .
do you really think that they do n't have a lot of money ?
there 's a lot of difference .
you 're right . we have to go to the cafeteria .
i m sorry . it s not that bad . the only thing is that i m going to be able to do something like this .
that s great . i m going to prescribe some chips .
ok let 's just get a look . oh this is the first one we have in the right .
we are in the same room .
yes ! i did n't know it .
i went to a party with a party at the party and have a great time .
do you think it 's much better than the public school ?
it 's not so easy . we should do that .
like what ?
well they just want to know how to play the piano .
what else can we do ?
if you do n't want to get to the top you can get a good impression on each other .
how about some of the information ?
yes . you should pay your bill .
what do you think of the quality ?
i think that the most important thing is that we are willing to work as our company is as well as the best of our company is in good condition .
i thought you were just that . i thought they were just going to be an excellent opportunity for you to be a successful person .
to be honest with the truth i 'm not really worried about the most important thing .
let me see . . . it 's my first size .
would you like to go there ?
no i can t .
that s fine .
sorry i 'm afraid it 's too expensive .
oh . . .
i want to go to the store to see if there is a problem .
it s a <unk> . i m not sure .
really ? i m going to get to the gym as soon as possible .
actually you can t take a long time . we have to go to the cafeteria .
i don t think i can t afford that .
let me see . oh yes . it s at 8 00 .
wow that 's all right .
it 's at the end of the road .
thank you .
ok . i ll get my car .
i m so sorry !
i 'm a teacher .
what s your favorite name ?
but it s not a very difficult thing to be .
why do you want to go for a movie ?
i m going to the office on campus .
yes here you are .
is this your first time to come in ?
what would you like to drink ?
i need to take a look at the internet to see if they re all right .
to think of the most important thing in the world is a good thing .
yes i can think about it .
well it 's just that i think if you are not good at your job you should have a lot of money .
what s wrong with them ?
i would say that the most important thing is that i would be a good thing .
yes it is .
i was told by my girlfriend . it was so nice of her .
i know that but i do n't know what to do .
i was n't able to do about it .
that 's too bad .
yes i 've been here for years .
oh really ? what did you say ?
i think it 's a hard way to get a job .
i think it s too bad .
about three years .
that 's a good job .
i 'm not sure . but he 's very handsome .
i hope that we can do that .
five . my father mother brother sisterinlaw and me .
i have my own family .
i didn t know you were a good teacher .
we 're a little bit of a bit but we 've got a big one .
it 's a great idea . we have n't had a lot of money there .
we are always on the same way . i love being out of the city but not all the time .
i was just wanted to go out for her . she 's a real girl .
what did you do ?
no she 's a bit tired .
sounds like it was a bit .
yes of course .
i see . what kind of food would you like to go ?
i 'm not sure .
it 's about the most popular game .
and i think that he had a good idea to be a good idea .
well it was a terrible game .
he does n't seem to be able to see his grandchildren .
well he 's a very tall <unk> .
ha ! i 'm glad you 're right . i 've never heard of a movie .
yeah he had a lot of money to make up .
well i think he 's more exciting .
i 'm not sure . he 's going to be a teacher .
oh i was born on the sidewalk . i really like it .
what was your major in college ?
i had a pretty strict upbringing and my parents taught at a university so they have no choice for me .
i think you did n't have to do that .
yes i do . i have to be a lot of friends in my country .
oh i see . what about the other one ?
i went to the university of ohio in america .
oh yes that is really a good job . you know how to work overtime ?
i am a journalist . i have an accountant .
you can tell me how to use them .
no i didn t .
that sounds like you did n't do well .
it was a very difficult job .
what happened ?
no i 'm not .
i see . that s why there are many things that i can do for you .
my husband and i have no idea what they are .
a new year 's year for you ?
for me too . they say that a lot of people are always friendly .
don t you think you were going to be able to get married ?
no i do n't think so . i 'm just looking forward to it .
what do you do about this ?
that 's right . but i think it 's a good idea to get a lot of money .
you should do n't mind that . you do n't have a good choice . you should try to avoid some kind of things .
i don t know what the matter is .
that sounds great . i 'm really glad i 'm going to be able to help .
i 'd love to go out with some great friends . we should have some fresh food too .
you 're a great meal . i 'll go and see you .
well i 'm glad you like it .
good ! you 're really going to love me !
well let 's see . . . i 'm not a bit of a dancer . . .
let 's go to the beach with our friends .
well . . .
no . i 'm not sure .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't believe it .
that that was it ! the last one was the same at the moment i was told that the one i had to go to the movies on saturday .
you 're right ! i ca n't believe it !
i 'm not sure but probably about it .
about 70 i think . it 's about the most of the modern course . it 's about the best part .
i heard that the government must have more information about the contract .
perhaps we should try to get more exercise .
did she ? that s great .
how 's your son going to work with her ?
oh they 're fine . they are just married .
he must be a teenager . you know he 's a good guy .
i had it all right when i was . but you know it s not a good idea to be a good idea .
yes i think you are right . i 'd like to try my best .
is there a big problem with a big school ?
yes there is . there are some <unk> in my country . they are not very expensive .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . they are too different to be independent .
it s not too far to get a big impression on the internet .
what happened ?
he was a bit nervous but i was thinking of a bit of a guy who was looking at the moment . he was just looking forward to it .
he should be able to do it .
yes but i think he s very good at all .
did he tell you that you were the most kind of person in that guy ?
no . i did n't know anything about it .
did you get any honors or something ?
no i don t think we can . i m going to get a look at the same thing .
you should be able to find a lot of things .
i think i love being a bit fed up with the people .
i would love to be able to see that if you want to see me a lot .
what about the world ?
what do you mean ?
but it s not easy to get along with .
that s true . but i m not sure if the boss will do .
i think it s true .
i know that . i 'm not a good idea . i think they will be a good one .
it 's not really . that 's why we have n't been in the country for a long time .
i just just need my advice .
i just went to bed and i was just taking a walk .
that s a good idea . you should also get a good impression of the interviewer .
that s what i m going to say .
it was a lot of fun . and i guess i had a bad idea of the old one .
did you ? what did you do ?
he 's fine but he was a bit tired .
i need to know what we need to get to the office .
of course . what do you want to know ?
let s see . . . i think i can get a few minutes to get there .
no not very much . he s really pretty .
i agree . i 'm not sure he 's a bit worried .
yes . they are too cute .
what kind of personality do you think you are doing ?
i think i am good at work . i am always interested in the position .
oh i do n't think you 're so happy !
yes but you know what ?
you 're right . i love going out with my friends .
so you 'll be able to get a drink ?
of course !
i will be there for you .
if everyone turned up it would be a good idea to be a lot of fun .
are you sure ?
i 'm going to have a new dinner tomorrow evening .
that s a good idea . she s a very good player .
yeah . i love going to the movies with a great boss .
i m glad that she s going to be a bit too revealing .
well i m not sure . i ll be able to get away from you .
it was a great movie . i was hoping you could come back to my office tomorrow .
i got a fine idea . we ll probably get something to drink .
i m afraid not i ll take it . i ll take care of it .
i m going to get rid of this one .
ok . we can do it for you .
yeah i m glad he s a good idea . he s always very happy .
i think he s a bit too far away . i guess he s very busy .
i think that the government had a good idea to get rid of the results .
what did you do that ?
that s my favorite . i could n't seem to find a big one .
no . . . that s great . i m glad you ve been to the party .
that s so bad . i thought you were going to quit smoking . i m not sure you know what i mean .
all all right . i ll take care of it .
well first of all you have to be in the same way . it 's the most important thing for me .
so it s a big one . it s an old one . it s a little expensive but it will cost a lot of money .
yes . it s one of my bedroom and it s on the second floor .
what s the matter ?
oh that s a great idea . it s too expensive for me .
are the tickets ready for the new apartment ?
yes they are .
do you have a large edition of that ?
no we don t . we have a lot of beautiful but we have a big house .
you re right . we can t get a big house at the first time we ll be able to see what we can do .
it s a very long way to get it .
my friend and i like to be a child .
that s right ! they always get a good idea !
most of them are . they are just a child . they are not in the mood for their own . they re not in a big mood to see them .
so what should i do ?
well i got a lot of things . i 'm a bit tired .
what s wrong with it ?
i have a bad headache .
so i thought they were supposed to be able to do that .
i think it s the most important thing .
not really . i like to buy some chinese food for my own food .
great . i m going to the <unk> you have to buy a new one .
not really . i don t mind being able to find the problems .
i m sorry to hear you re not going to be able to do that . i don t want you to be able to help me with your job . i m sure you ll have to pay for it .
i do . i 'm a bit worried about my job . i 'm a bit worried about my job .
so so how about the new apartment ?
ok . i ll just tell you what i am going to do .
sure . i ll be glad to help you . what do you want to know ?
ok . i ve got my own office .
thanks for letting me know .
no . i think i 'm going to be able to find something like that .
oh you 're so kind .
you too .
everything is fine . thanks .
not too much . i 'm a bit tired .
yes i 'm sorry .
you 'll know if that 's ok .
i 'm glad to see you .

it 's the best one . i 'm really sorry .
oh i see . thank you .
alright . it s a bit too expensive i 've been looking forward to it .
how about the subway ?

oh that 's a good idea . i 'll take it .
that 's fine . i 'll take it .
it 's about two minutes walk .

what do you think about it ?
no . it 's not a long way but it 's not far . the subway is just around the corner .

i 'm sure about the price of a course .
ok . thank you very much .

if you want to buy a new one we can take you to the gym with a new one you can have a look at the menu .

ok . if you want to tell you the truth i am not sure about your job .
yes i am very busy right now .
good for you .
thanks . i am very glad to hear that .
i am not sure about the job that i have learned to be a lot of work .
do you think that 's a lot of work ?
of course .
well i am not sure .
ok . i 'll be back in a minute .
i 'm sorry . i 'm afraid i ca n't afford to pay for it .

i am sorry to hear that . what are you going to do ?
yes i do .
that 's right . i 'll be glad to get them for you .
i want to work in a foreign currency .
it 's a good job .
can i help you ?
i am not happy that you are right . i m really happy with that .
i see if you could just give me the price of a few days .
well i 'm afraid you 've got a little more than you do n't want to be in a hurry .
sounds good . how about the other one ?
ok ok . let me know if you want to .
that is a very good idea . i 'm sure they will be able to find some information about it .
it is not a good idea . the company is very high in the city . and the prices are very important to us . we are not in the same market as the same as the environment .
that is the best part i 've ever had . i think it is more than a year .
certainly .
oh you 're so sorry . i did n't know you 're right .
you re welcome . i don t know what to say .
this is so good for you ! i will try my best to be able to get you a new one .
the most important thing is that we have to stay in the same way .
sounds not bad ! i will try my best to be a bit too far away from the first year !
well the company is very important and i don t know how to work with you .
oh really ? what 's your favorite time ?
sorry . we can make that .
well if you do n't mind it can be a little bit too long .
what 's the matter with your passport ?
what kind of work are you looking for ?
i am very sorry .
thank you for your help .
i am glad to hear that you are going to have a good time .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i 'd like to postpone that decision until i 'm not sure .
no the way i 've got a lot of money .
i think that i would like to offer a few reduction .
how long does it take to get there ?
it 's the most important thing to me .
you 'll have to pay a deposit .
i think i need to know about the fees .
yes of course .
yes i am looking forward to it .
they are all charge for a long time .
that 's a good idea .
ok . i 'll see you then .
i see . what about the salary ?
generally speaking there are a few months of work .
you 're welcome .
i 'm glad that you 're not interested .
would you like to have a drink ?
how much do you want to pay ?
i 'm not sure yet .
sure . i 'll be there with you right away .
the next time .
i can do that .
that would be great .
it 's not that way .
could you tell me how to get there ?
yes please .
i 'm not sure if i 'm going to be able to find a job .
i see . did you have any questions about the interview ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't afford it .
thank you for your advice . i am very happy to know that you are right .
maybe you know what i am doing .
yes that s right . if you could tell me a little about the quality of the quality our products and we have to pay a lot of money for the rent .
i want to see what the problem is .
here s your bill . thank you for your help .
i was thinking about buying a few things .
yes i m interested in applying for the job as well .
yes . do you have any other questions ?
yes i have a lot of experience in this field .
that sounds great .
yes my name is david and my phone number is <unk> .
thank you .
your company has a computer lab .
yes but i have to pay my credit card .
yes i m quite interested in your position .
could you tell me the exact time you want to leave ?
no we have n't decided that .
could you tell me how to use the internet ?
yes . i 'm in the mood for a few years .
oh i see . i think i can read the internet .
ok . i ll try my best to get to the office for a few days .
that s right . we ll be able to get together if you need any help .
i can t agree to that .
i m going to be there by tomorrow .
don t worry about that . i m sure they will be able to do that .
that s right . i m going to be there .
so do you want to go to the gym for a while ?
good . i think i should have a good rest .
i m sure we will .
i ll be able to help .
i will .
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see i am in the united states for my family .
not really so so as you know that they are very strict with their employees .
if you do n't mind the price i 'll take care of it .
no . i 'm not a clockwatcher . i 'm not sure if i can do it .
yes . i know that she 's really good to learn .
yes . that s not true . i m sure we can do a lot of things in this position .
it 's amazing to be honest with me . i 'm not a bit worried about the price of this position . i will have a try .
i think that 's why many people are in the same part .
i can t do that .
yes i d like to see it . but i m not sure if there s anything i can do to do about it .
that sounds good . i 'll take it .
i see . i ll just check my account for a few days .
yes . that 'll be a little bit too far from the us .
good . i ll take them .
i think you should do some good things for you .
i 'm glad to hear that . it 's like a lot of people who are getting married .
well the <unk> of the world is not good at the same thing .
that sounds pretty . i 've never seen a lot of people before .
do you know the price of our products in our country ? we have a lot of <unk> in this city .
yes .
oh i am afraid i have to be a problem .
ok i am sorry . i will have your name to mr . smith .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
you mean the network <unk> or you can use to get into the computer or not to be able to get the job done by working or on the internet .
yes i wanted to look for some information on the internet .
i have the same question . i can t believe that one as long as the boss is .
ok .
i am sorry . the first thing we were in the meeting was a bit worried . the problem is that our company has a large order of a large inspection . it 's just that the most important thing is to be able to find us .
i see . did you find that way ?
no not far from here . but we have to do some of the training . but you know how to use the internet to tell them the prices are not expensive .
i 'll be there for three days .
that 's true . i must have been looking for a lot of money but i 'm not sure if i could use the internet to pay my card .
no the company has no offer to be on sale . if you want to withdraw at least you can have a more reduction of 10 .
i understand . that is the best way to do .
i 'm glad that you 're right . we can do that .
it 's a good idea . i think we should do something more .
that 's true . do n't worry about that . i do n't think the quality of our products are much better than the others .
what about a few minutes ?
i see . that would be the best way to say is that the company must have been to be able to make more money than that .
no not at all . we have a lot of different kinds of things .
i 'm glad you like it .
i do n't think that the problem is that the problem is that the people who have a lot of good things in the world .
this is the best i 'm in the mood for .
well you can do that .
do you have any other questions ?
i have my own card .
yes i would like it . thanks for coming in .
ok . i will send a letter to you .
i want to know what the problem is .
why not ?
the price is too high . i 'm afraid we have to pay a credit card for a credit card .
i think that we can take a look at the price .
i see . it ll be a little more about the money .
it 's not as far as i thought it was the last time .
it 's pretty good . i 've never had a bad job before .
is that all ? i thought they were going to be a bit more than a long time .
it was n't really difficult . i had to pay a lot of money but i just ca n't afford to pay for it .
oh i see . where should i get them ?
that 's a big problem . we can do it for you .
yes mr . smith . what can i do for you ?
that 's fine . i 'll be there in a minute .
thank you for saying that . i 'm very happy to hear that .
that 's ok . i 'm glad to hear that .
that 's great ! i 'm glad to hear that .
