i won the lottery but i won t be able to have won the first prize in the lottery .
i think channel is a lot of fun .
i think i d like to buy a tv newspaper sometimes watch .
i think that teenagers should be often become addicted and violence .
that s right . that s why many people think that the kids eat and watch what they eat .
you are right . they are against drugs that they can cause immune system problems .
i think that the reason why i have to use the channel channel .
that s a good idea . we can find the location of a human resource .
i guess so . it s a lot of money to stop smoking .
yes . it s a policy of law . there are some shops shops around the country .
i see . you can tell the truth that we are causing crime and having good programs .
i think that there s a good point . what type of film will you use ?
it s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of detective .
did you read the story ?
i did n't like that . i think we had a very disagreement with other friends with other people . we had a great time . we had a lot of differences to have always been together .
i ve always wanted to be very happy with you . i ve always enjoyed making a big time with you .
not really . i think the critics are making the whole star wars .

i 'm afraid that the air conditioning is too small for us .
well i like to tell you the secret .
i think we should take the subway .
that 's a good idea . you can use the exhaust gases from our printing <unk> to protect the environment .
how about recycling ?
yes . the stewardess is a little faster and faster than the better .
i 'm afraid that the cardboard boxes are not strong enough .
i think i 'm in the same way as to my career .
i do n't think that any disputes is to pull out the problems .
i think we 're going to have to continue to become more part of the environment .
yes i used to be one of the most experienced families with the family .

i do n't think that he could do that .
he is a very intelligent man .
that 's a good idea . he does n't have a bad attitude towards america .
no not yet . if you ca n't find the entrance to the state entrance .
i 'll see him .
what 's your name ?
i think that teenagers are just about how much money they will turn on .
what about the results ?
i m going to put the gun down .
that s why it s always a good thing to buy .
i agree . but i think it is the most expensive thing .
what about the subjects you have to overcome the point of the subjects ?
that s a good idea . we will have to work with our company .
i guess that s right . if there are many people who will be fined .
the government should pay more attention to the environment and most people .
i know . i 'm worried about my daughter . she is a very serious person .
it was a nightmare .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . it 's <unk> .

well i think i 'll be able to get a better job than in a few years .
we have a big tree with a cat .
i think i 'll be in a hurry .
in that case there are many detective stories of a human body .
yes i think it 's a good way to go ahead .
i 'm glad to hear that . but i do n't like jade bracelets .
they are 168 .
i think the ticket is over there . the ticket is valid for the first two months .
i 'm not sure . but she 's going to be a manager .
i 'm sorry but i do n't know how to use it .

i 'm not sure . i 'll play basketball with my friends .
i know but i 'm not in the mood for it .
where can i get my ticket ?
i want to play football with my friends .
good question . i want to think about it .
i 'm not sure but i 'm still worried about my life .
i agree . we ca n't expect a lot to break on our own .
hi jim . how are you doing ?
i 'm doing well . i ve always been looking for a job .
i think you are a good employee .
i 'm just looking for a pair of shoes .
i think you should ask about the job .
i am not sure . i guess i should work out more .
yeah you are right . maybe we can help you with the company ?
how do you feel about your work ?
what did you think of your present job ?
i 'm not sure . i 'll be back soon .
i 'm in a bit of a hurry .

there are plenty of golf courses . there are many people who have to do it .
i think that the older generation are active and more active .
he is a hard worker . he always looks like a man in the clever way .
of course . i get along with each other .
you mean you ca n't do that ?
thank you . i 'm sure you will be doing well .
no salt is not too good .
i know but i do n't like the sight .
oh that 's a great idea . what 's the matter ?
that 's a bad idea . how old is she ?
yes i 've been waiting for her .
well i think you 'd better ask her to give up my notice .
she 's a little older than me .
you mean you 're just addicted . you can go out with the game .
i 'll try .
you know that you are a little <unk> .
yes . i will be there in about three days .
i think it 's summer in the city .
oh yeah . she 's a pretty friend .
here we go .
yes i do . it 's on the 7th floor .
let 's see . we should be able to see it before we finish our apartment . if we can order it for you we should probably get it .
i usually use office phones online and send emails to customers .
yeah i guess i should do it online .
what are you talking about ?
that 's fine . i 'll be back next week .
i 'm a little worried about my work .
that 's a good idea . you can imagine that .
i 'm not sure . what 's the problem ?
yes i agree . i think it is our part of the job .
it s at the airport .
i am sorry sir . i 'll bring you a refund .
i have a headache and my throat is inflamed .
no it has a virus that has a computer and it has a virus that has a computer program on it .
well it 's a polo . the logo is falling behind behind the back .
yes it is . we re here to go to work in the company .
yes . i think it 's the most important thing to move up .
what 's the proposal ?
yeah i 'm not sure . what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm so sorry to hear that . i 'll be back soon .
i will . thanks for your help .
i like playing basketball .
i do n't like movies either .
i think you 're right .
i like all kinds of stuff .
i 'm not sure . i 'd like to go to the movies .
did you enjoy watching it ?
yes they are . they are also very uncomfortable .
i can tell you what they will do .
i go to the theater . i go to bed and go to bed every day .
yeah you are a good student .
well it 's a good idea to get along with you .
what kind of apartment do you want ?
yes it is . it 's a good brand .
but sometimes the government ca n't stand their mistake .
you can ask the information about the card .
is it a horror movie ?
yeah . it 's a story about a horror movie .
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure if i can .
that 's a funny thing .
how would you like your bean curd ?
certainly . there are a few kinds of stuff that you like . you can find something you like .
well i 'm not sure . i guess i 'd like to tell you about a friend of mine .
that 's right . you can see that movie is not the most popular ones .
yeah . i like horror movies .
i 'm not sure . i think i can understand .
i think that 's the point .
i know . it 's a drama movie .
yes . it 's a very exciting job .
i 'm sorry but i 've got to be there .
i had a table for two but i heard that it 's a healthy and it 's a healthy thing for me .
you are right . in other words you are right . you can t imagine that many people in the same restaurant .
i guess that 's true . i guess i 'm not a good thing .
you 'd better face the host host host host host host host host face .
i guess i 'm not a bit worried about that . i never knew anything about it .
in that case he speaks very clearly . in fact he does not in a very short way .
i 'm afraid i ca n't bear eating when i eat . i ca n't eat a few more .
i know . but i 'm sure you will be able to work with it .
i went to the store with my friend and i had a wedding in the car .
no he is n't . he is probably a <unk> who is ?
i 'm sure he wo n't do that .
that 's true . i 've got to think about it .
i 'm sure you 're right . but what 's the matter ?
but you have to be serious .
i guess that 's all right . but how about this one ?
