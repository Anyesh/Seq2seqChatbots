i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .
yeah . it s scary .
i agree . they are often more expensive than tv . they do have a lot of tv in the past .
i know . i know . i am not a good cook but i don t want to watch the news in the library .
that s fine . we can do that for you .
yes . i think that s a good idea .
i think so . i don t like the way that there s a lot of competition in my country .
i know . i think that we should do more outdoor because we like to buy a new one .
i think that the government should do more advertising planning .
it s a real thriller .
how did you do it ?
i think i am the only good movie i ve ever seen . i ve seen a movie with a friend of mine .

i think we should do more calculations on the sand .
what 's the problem ?
it 's a kind of a big favor .
that 's true . we can do more exercise in the afternoon .
if you do n't want to put the car in the car then you can choose the wood <unk> .
that 's a good idea . if i do n't have any other outside outside sale like that .
that 's a good idea .
that 's a good idea .
i think that it 's a very good idea .
i think that the only thing is that we should do is relax .
i 'm also a <unk> company that 's why i want to become a part of the earth to continue to be a planet for the future .
no i have n't .

i 'm from germany .

i think that it is a bit expensive .
i think that the government should do more exercise .
how do you think we should do that ?
it s true . we need to buy a new one .
