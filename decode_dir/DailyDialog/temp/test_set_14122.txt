i do n't think so . she 's as good as her as my grandmother .
you have to think about her . she is a good boss .
you must have been here for about half an hour .
i 'm glad you 're saying so . i 've been looking forward to it .
i 'm so happy that you found a nice evening .

i think it 's a good choice .
you should know what she is .
i know what you mean . i do n't think they should do anything .
i do n't know . she 's a little older .
what kind of store are you looking for ?
she 's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
i know . but i 'm still worried about how to goes .
i know that . i do n't think i could be able to get a promotion that would make it easier for me to get away from the internet .
you 're welcome . i 'm sure you 'll like it .
ok .
i 'm just thinking of getting a costume and i do n't want to be a big party .

yes . i 've been working on it for a while .
that 's good . i can also recommend that many people who are already trained overseas .

ok . let s go .
i think that they are just the most important piece of the world .
how do you feel about that ?

yes sir . we have to go to the souvenir shop there .
i think you should go to the convenience store . there are many pictures in the <unk> store .
i know what you mean . i can understand why we ca n't go to the butcher 's shop to buy some paint .
pretty well . i ve been working on it for a while .
i know what you mean . i ve been going to get away to the beach all day .
yes . i went there once last summer .
well i am not . i am looking for a beautiful scene and beautiful flowers .
it 's not that bad . there are more than 20 people who live in the city .
i think the romans do .
it 's not too bad .
they 're cute .
but i think it 's too early to have a face in the reality .
yes . i 'm afraid i ca n't finish typing it .
i 'm glad you like them . i 'm glad you like them .
i do n't think they 're the only one who never laugh at me .
yes i 've been there before .

i 'm so happy that you found what you wanted .
you 're so oldfashioned . it 's not the only one who has been keeping up the good work .
i think it 's a good idea .
the government is making efforts in the market .
i think you should make a big mistake .
he 's in the hospital with some money .
i know what you mean .
he said he had been eating too much .
i know . i know . i did n't mean to tell him .
i think that you are very lucky .
i know you do n't like it .

i 'm sorry . i 'm not in the mood for it .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i know . but it 's not my fault .
i think he is really a nice guy .
i think you should try to find out if you like .
it sure is .
you 'll find a taxi stand on the desk .
no he 's still in the hospital .
i 'd like to tell you that i 'm going to the olympic games .
i 'm just nervous . i just do n't know what to tell him .
i 'm not sure but she 's actually very conservative .
but she means to have a look at her .
oh i know what you mean .
i 'm not sure . i 'll just use my yoyo .
you should try it .
i know . i know . but i do n't know how to use this printer .
i know that .
he is . he is a nice girl .
he did n't make any difference .
i 'd love to but i 'm not sure if i can .
i don t want to hear you .

i think i can find a nice sweater .
i 'm going to the cinema .
i 'm not sure .
yes i like it very much .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'd love to .
i think you should make a decision .
i 'm not sure if i can .
i think you should do something else .
i 'm doing well . i 'm just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of my job . it s hard to learn .
i 'm fine . i 'm just looking forward to seeing you .
yes . i 've read about it .
oh that 's too bad . what about tomorrow ?
exactly ! it 's a really popular game with some people who have been investigating the oven to make the exact impression of the film .
i know . i 'm going to try to find a job that is more suitable for you .
yes . if you can t find another job then it will certainly not be a shortterm one .
i 'm not sure . i just ca n't decide what to say .
i know . i think it 's a must for a long time .
oh how did she react ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm going to have to call you back .
that 's true . it seems that there are only some ways to save money .
but it is not difficult to learn .
i think the government should do something about it .
you did ?
i think you should have told her . she must be very pleased with her .
i had the first time .
i think that he s very intelligent .
i know . but i am not in a bad mood .

you are not kidding . you 're not going to be lifting these days .

i mean you could n't do anything .
it s about 10 percent off the meter .
i m sorry . i m late . i must go to bed .
i 'd love to .

i think that you should go to the interview .
i like going to the movies .
well if you want to be a good ending for a person .
it 's a horror movie .
i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if i can find it .
yes it is . it 's a perfect fit for people .

i 'd love to .
i do n't know what the inside said .
hey i 'm just reading the things you 're so professional . i 'm always trying to say that .
that sounds great . do you want to see it ?
i like all kinds of stuff . i like romance stories .
well that 's not the only problem . there are several types of movies that are usually the same .
i do n't think that it 's a good idea .
i know . i think it 's the reason why we have n't had a meeting yet .
i think that they are the only ones who have the type of movie .
what 's on ?
i 'm sorry . i 've got a receipt .
i 'm glad you like it .
i do n't know . i do n't know what to tell you .
that 's true . you should reflect it a true true true true enough to be a true way to be a true true true way to judge whether or not .
i think maybe i 'll have a try .
you think it 's better to be a little too . you should be considered rude to the old .
i guess i did n't realize that .
so you said it .
i 'll never forget to drink again .
i see .

i do n't know what to say . i do n't think i 'm in the mood for a job that is to be a good manager .
that 's right . but it seems to be a little more expensive than the one .
i know . i know . but i ca n't believe it .
i know . but it is hard to believe it will make us feel like a good friend to be true .
i like it very much . i like it very much .

yes . there are several famous corporations . they use a lot of space in doing business so on .

he borrowed it from me and ended up with a fine .

i know . but i don t think i m ready for the party .
i know . i was in a hurry . i forgot to put it in the bag .
i think that you are right . i think that you should be a good fit .
i think that the only reason is that the only reason is that the people are wearing a more casual day .
i do n't know . maybe i 'll ask him to call my brother and his or her .
i do n't know what to say .
that sounds like a good idea . it must be a shame to lose such a good time .
